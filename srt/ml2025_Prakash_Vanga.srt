1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm Prakesh Vanga.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,750
Overall, 13 years of exchange experience
specializing in AWS cloud engineer

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,060
and identity access management.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,220
Currently serving as an A WS
data engineer, designing and

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,650
implementing scalable and secure data
pipelines, leveraging AWS services.

7
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:28,590
Over the years, I had the opportunity
to work across complex enterprise.

8
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:33,285
Environments helping organization
not only migrate to the cloud, but

9
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:39,885
also optimize how they manage data
securely, efficiently and intelligently.

10
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:46,605
Today I'm truly excited to speak to
you about a topic that close to both my

11
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,195
technical experience and future vision.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,190
A driven integration
revolutionizing data management in.

13
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,605
Multicloud enterprise environments.

14
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:06,315
In today's session, I would walk with
how a power integration frameworks

15
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:12,345
can transform enterprise operation
by eliminating the complexity

16
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:19,390
of working across multiple cloud
platforms like AWS Azure GCP,

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,790
improving visibility performance, and.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,850
Security and delivering measurable ROI,
while ensuring organizations stay fully

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
compliant with evolving regular standards.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,210
Whether you are in financial service,
healthcare, our technology, the strategies

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,480
and techniques will explode today,
our designed to help you motorize your

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,380
data infrastructure, reduce operational
overhead, and gain a complete edge.

23
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,965
In a rapidly evolving digital world.

24
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:57,585
Let's get started.

25
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:03,535
So the slide, multi-cloud
reality, the integration

26
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:06,055
challenge, let's start with the.

27
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:11,305
Reality we face today, most
enterprises don't operate in a

28
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,225
single cloud environment anymore.

29
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:20,035
They're using AWS for scalability,
Azure for enterprise integration and

30
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:24,475
GCP for AI services simultaneously.

31
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:28,585
But with this flexibility
comes complexity, we end

32
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,015
corner four main challenges.

33
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:34,544
First one is of fragmented data.

34
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,404
And enterprise has moved to the
cloud, many adaptive multi-cloud

35
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:45,164
strategies leveraging AWS for
scalability, Azure for enterprise

36
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:49,154
integration, and GC GCP for a services.

37
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:56,624
While these hybrid approaches
provide flexibility, it also data

38
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:59,234
ecosystems it's not helping much more.

39
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:02,649
So what happened in practice is customer.

40
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:08,564
Records might be stored in AWS
S3, for example, applications log

41
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:11,385
logs are log and index in Azure.

42
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:17,594
Monitor and analytic data takes
results in Google Cloud BigQuery.

43
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,554
These environments don't
talk to each other natively.

44
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:26,385
Each uses different
formats, different APIs.

45
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,314
And next one, security vulnerability.

46
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,705
Each cloud has different
policies and protocols.

47
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:42,894
This inconsistency introduces gaps
between technology and also, let us

48
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:48,355
tell one example, let us know address
one of the most pressing issues in

49
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:52,975
any multi-cloud architecture, security
vulnerability caused by inconsistent

50
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:57,144
policy enforcement across cloud providers.

51
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:03,654
While each cloud being AWS Microsoft
Azure or Google Cloud platform, GCP

52
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:06,385
offers strong native secure controls.

53
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:11,665
They are fundamentally different in
design, configuration, and operation.

54
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:16,255
This lack of standardization
introduces significantly risk when

55
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:22,730
organizations attempts to unify
them under when one architecture,

56
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,250
what causes these vulnerabilities?

57
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,044
Different security models.

58
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:34,600
Each cloud product has own IAM
identity access management, AWS use

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,054
IM roles and policies and Azure users.

60
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,125
Role-based access control.

61
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:48,804
GCP relies on IAM bindings and
roles tied to resources hierarchies.

62
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,985
These models are not.

63
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:57,895
Interoperable and even small
misconfigurations like or permission

64
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:04,225
roles or inconsistent MFA policies
can become entry point for attackers.

65
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:11,845
Operational inefficient integration
is often manual error, resources

66
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,515
heavy and time consuming.

67
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,625
Let's now examine a critical
barrier to enterprise agility and

68
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,515
perform in multi-cloud environments.

69
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:25,074
Operational efficiency
caused by manual integration.

70
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:31,464
While the term may sound procedural,
it impacts in strategic affecting

71
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,294
productivity, scalability,
and business continuity.

72
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,474
So what is the manual integration?

73
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:43,074
Manual integration refers
to the non-automatic human

74
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:47,005
driven process of connecting
services, transferring data, and.

75
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,370
Aligning workflow between
cloud platform like AWS Azure

76
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,500
and GCP compliance complexity.

77
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:03,130
So for example, meeting HIPA
Health Insurance Portability and

78
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,919
Accountability Act are SOX Compliance
in a multi-cloud setup requires deep

79
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,260
expertise and constant monitoring.

80
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,240
Having discussion, the operational
security and data challenging

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,010
in multi-cloud ecosystem, let's
now turn to a domain that is

82
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,829
equally critical compliance.

83
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,559
But when your data and workloads
are spread across AWS Azure and

84
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:33,669
Google Cloud compliance becomes
exponentially more complex.

85
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,890
So why complex compliance is
so challenging in multi-cloud?

86
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:43,129
One is different regions, different rules.

87
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,039
Each cloud provides source
data in multiple regions.

88
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:51,499
By default, if you don't configure
storage correctly, your data might land

89
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:57,589
in incorrect path where Stryker rules
apply and you may not even know it.

90
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:04,339
For example, I will take A-H-I-P-A Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability

91
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:07,069
Act mandates end-to-end encryption.

92
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:12,005
And stick to access control for
healthcare data, one misconfiguration

93
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:17,044
can lead to regular breach and
several financial penalties.

94
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,015
And in consistent audit trail.

95
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:23,585
Each cloud logs and tracks
eventually differently.

96
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,164
AWS VS Cloud trial.

97
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,164
Azure has monitor and log analytics.

98
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,135
GCP has cloud audit logs.

99
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,909
Without integration, these logs
become disjoint, making it extremely

100
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,819
difficult to perform infra audits.

101
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:46,699
Responses to incidents are pro
compliance during external assessments,

102
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,679
evolving regulations, so regulator
requirements changes frequently,

103
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:57,650
keeping up with updates across
multiple compliance while aligning with

104
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,639
multiple cloud provided configurations
required constant manual efforts and.

105
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,544
Specialized knowledge.

106
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:07,294
This is not just a legal risk,
it's a operational drain.

107
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,984
We'll go to next slide.

108
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:16,684
AI transformation automation
integration, AI transform

109
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,184
automat, automated data mapping.

110
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:24,455
Let's now talk about how AI transforms
integration, starting with one of

111
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:29,584
the most powerful feature automated
data mapping in a multi-cloud setup.

112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,539
Data exists in many formats,
structures, and locations spread across

113
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,179
platforms like AWS, Azure and GCP.

114
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,810
Traditionally, connecting this data
requires manual mapping, understanding

115
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,885
source and target fields, writing
transformational logic, ensuring

116
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,920
data types and format align.

117
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,710
This process is time consuming,
prone to human error and needs.

118
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,634
Constant updates whenever schema changes.

119
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,334
So what does a do differently?

120
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:08,374
So with automated data mapping,
we use advanced machine learning

121
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:16,624
algorithm that can scan and understand
data sets, even if they come from

122
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,154
completely different systems.

123
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,735
Automatically detects
relationship between fields.

124
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:26,175
For example, it can recognize
that customer ID in AWS.

125
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:31,155
It matches to Azure customer number.

126
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:37,515
If it don't match us, it'll cause
the issue generally accurate.

127
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:41,265
Mapping logic without requiring manual
intervention, the results are impressive

128
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:48,340
by using AI For this task, we are, we
have seen 85% reduction in manual data

129
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:53,865
mapping efforts, significantly improved
accuracy, especially in large scale.

130
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:57,435
Thousands of fields schemas.

131
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:03,285
So fashion integration, timelines
and fewer errors in production

132
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,375
and intelligent data routing.

133
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:12,825
So next, let's how transform that
where data moves across multi-cloud

134
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:16,485
environments with a concept
called intel and data routing.

135
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:21,595
In traditional systems, data
flow are typically static.

136
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:22,960
Once you define.

137
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,440
A route from one cloud service to another.

138
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,220
It remains fixed regardless
of change in network traffic

139
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,550
latency system performance.

140
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:39,720
But in dynamic multi-cloud environments
like AWS Azure and GCP network

141
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,550
conditions can change every second.

142
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:49,170
And a fixed road can easily become a slow
or overloaded path, reducing performance.

143
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,155
So what is intelligent data routing?

144
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:58,575
So with a power routing, the system is no
longer pass you our active learning and

145
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,915
optimizing in real time here what it is.

146
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:06,075
Analyzing network traffic conditions
continuously, such as bandwidth

147
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:12,405
availability, latency, and server
loads, chooses the fastest, most

148
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,395
efficient path for data to travel
every time as a request is made.

149
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:18,885
Instant.

150
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:24,295
If something changes like traffic spike
system, slow down this enterprise that

151
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:30,685
your data reaches its destination faster,
avoids bottleneck, and maintain consistent

152
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,725
performance across all cloud platform.

153
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:39,385
In real world, we see significant
reduce reduction in latency, improve

154
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:43,735
throughput, far high volume data
applications, and much better system

155
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:46,195
availability, especially during.

156
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:51,895
Peak traffic and next
governance enforcement.

157
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,285
The final piece of a driven
integration I would like to

158
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,615
highlight is governance enforcement.

159
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:04,495
A major leap forward is managing
complaints across multi-cloud BroadB beds.

160
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:09,595
Now, let's be honest, governance and
complaints are often seen as complex,

161
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:12,385
time consuming and constantly changing.

162
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,966
Every organization must follow industry
regulations like G-D-P-R-H-I-P-A,

163
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,850
or SOCs, depending on your sector.

164
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,310
But when you're working across
multiple cloud platforms, AWS, Azure,

165
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,570
GCP, keeping policies consistent,
become extremely difficult.

166
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,580
Each platform has different tools,
different permission structures,

167
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,650
different upgrade cycles.

168
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,430
So manually mounting is not
only slow, it is also risky.

169
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,225
So what does AI do for governance?

170
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:50,365
This is where AI powered policies,
engines make a huge difference.

171
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:56,335
These engines are self-learning, meaning
they monitor evolving regulations and

172
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,135
automatically apply the latest rule.

173
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,685
They enforce compliance consistently
across all cloud platform, no

174
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,960
matter how complex your setup is.

175
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:14,305
Companies that reduces the compliance
monitoring workload by up to 70% real

176
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:17,155
time visibility across cloud ecosystem.

177
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:23,635
So issue detection, early problem
identification with the ai.

178
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,865
Now let's talk about one of the
most powerful outcome of a driven

179
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:33,685
integration, early problem detection
in complex multi-cloud environments.

180
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,485
Issue can arise at any time.

181
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:41,605
A failed data transfer, a
slowdown in response time, or

182
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,905
even silent security misalignment.

183
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:49,375
So traditionally, these problems
are only discovered after they

184
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,015
cause visible damage like an outage.

185
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,525
CSLA or compliance were violations.

186
00:13:55,705 --> 00:14:00,955
So A helps a change the game
by acting as 24 by seven

187
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,165
intelligent monitoring systems.

188
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,880
So here what it does, it constantly
scans logs, data flow, and system

189
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,730
behavior across all cloud platform.

190
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,850
It uses patterns, recognization and
detection to spot irregularities

191
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,670
often before humans can notice them.

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,940
It can even predict potential failures
by learning from past system behavior.

193
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:37,405
This proactive led to a 94% improvement
in early issues detection, so resolution

194
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:43,135
time, faster, troubleshooting with
the ai, following on early detection.

195
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,725
Let's talk about what happened next.

196
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:48,775
Resolving the issue with traditional
systems, even when a problem is

197
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:53,575
detected, finding the root cause
can take hours or even days.

198
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,260
Teams must manually check logs, trace
dependencies across cloud services,

199
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:05,320
and coordinate between multiple
platforms like AWS, Azure and GCP.

200
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:13,540
This is slow, frustrating, and costly
how a speeds are troubleshooting with

201
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,650
a driven monitoring and diagnostics,
the story is very different.

202
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,125
A helps reduce troubleshooting
time by seven six percentage.

203
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,390
Automate root cause analysis.

204
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,160
AI quickly pinpoints the source
of problem, whether it is

205
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,300
misconfigured permissions, a failing
service or drop network package.

206
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,550
Correlated log insights.

207
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,610
It analyzes logs across all cloud
simultaneously identifying patterns

208
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,815
and depending this in seconds,
small recommendations based on the

209
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:52,960
historical data, AI can suggest the
most effective resolution reducing.

210
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:58,195
Guesswork and back and forth
and operational efficiency,

211
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,315
pushing it team productivity.

212
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:04,495
With the ai, let's now look at one.

213
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:10,045
One of the most exciting outcomes
of AI driven integration is 3.5 x

214
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,695
increase in operational efficiency.

215
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:18,690
That means IT teams are getting more
than three times the work, the with

216
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,115
resources and less manual effort.

217
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,240
In a traditional setup, your
IT team is constantly switching

218
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,870
between cloud dashboard, writing
scripts, troubleshooting error,

219
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:34,570
managing integrations, and trying
to make sense of skater data.

220
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,720
It's not just exhausting, it's
inefficient, so a boost efficiency.

221
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,760
With a power unified monitoring
platforms, your team no longer have to

222
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,890
chase problems across systems in shape.

223
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,830
The benefit form single.

224
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,895
Pan of glass visibil
across AWS Azure and GCP.

225
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,545
Maybe you can use single dashboard.

226
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,915
No more jumping between dashboards.

227
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:03,025
Everything is integrated into
one intelligent interface,

228
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,755
automatic alert systems in place.

229
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:10,465
And hey, doesn't just tell that
you there something is wrong in,

230
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:13,765
tell what, where and how to fix it.

231
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:17,435
And going Next slide.

232
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:22,155
Implementation framework,
the assessment phase.

233
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:27,015
Let's now talk about how we begin
implementing AI driven integration

234
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,845
across a multi-cloud environments.

235
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:33,315
The first and most important steps in
the assessment phase, this is very,

236
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:37,995
we lay the foundation for success by
thoroughly understanding the current

237
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:42,165
environment, aligning it with the
business goals and identifying.

238
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,865
Where AI can make the biggest impact.

239
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:50,865
So the step one, current state analysis,
the first thing we do is map out

240
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,715
your existing cloud infrastructure.

241
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:58,095
We identify which service are
running AWS, Azure and GCP

242
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,735
based on the cloud technology.

243
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:06,195
Where there are performance gaps, T
process are security vulnerabilities.

244
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,975
This queues as clear
picture of the baseline.

245
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:13,485
What's working, what not,
and where we can improve.

246
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:20,835
Think of it as performing a health checks,
whatever, multi-cloud architecture and

247
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:23,775
step two, business requirement mapping.

248
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:28,895
So next we align the technic technical
side with the business goals.

249
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,085
What outcomes are you trying to achieve?

250
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,514
Is it faster taxes?

251
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,395
Lower costs, or strong compliance?

252
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,740
When then define clear key
performance indicators and return on

253
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,580
investments metrics to measure the
success of integration initiatives.

254
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,420
This ensures that the solution is not
just technical sound, but business driven.

255
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,570
And step three, finally, we look at how
data flows across your cloud platform.

256
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,090
How much data are you moving,
how fast that is needs to travel.

257
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,625
How complex are the transformation?

258
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:13,024
This help us identifying high impact
integrations, opportunities, places

259
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:20,225
where a can boost speed, reduce error,
and improve efficiency the most.

260
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:25,860
It also helps prioritize what we integrate
first for maximum business values.

261
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,730
So I'm going to next slide.

262
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,485
Strategic platform selection.

263
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,615
Choose the right
foundation for integration.

264
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:40,085
Once we complete the assessment
phase, the next key step is

265
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:44,435
implementing AI driven integration
is choosing the right platform.

266
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,315
This is what we call
strategic platform selections.

267
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:54,035
Not all platforms are created equal, and
the wrong choice can lead to login, poor

268
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,585
performance, and endless customization.

269
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,275
So we focus on four critical
factors that defines.

270
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,600
Further ready integration platform.

271
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,720
So the first one is interoperability.

272
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:11,899
First, we look at multi-cloud or
your integration platform must

273
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:16,129
work seamless with different cloud
APIs, various data formats, and

274
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,560
multiple communication protocols.

275
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,200
This means you should be able to
connect AWS Azures, GCP, and even

276
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,205
on print systems without writing
C code for each connection.

277
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:34,925
Think of it like a universal translator
that allows all of our cloud services

278
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:40,254
to talk to each other smoothly
and instantly has a capabilities.

279
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:45,625
We want a platform that comes with
built in machine learning tool for

280
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,445
predictive integration, like sporting
potential failures before they happen.

281
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:55,105
Pat recognized across data sets and.

282
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,850
Autonomous optimization of workflow.

283
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,730
So the system keeps
improving itself over time.

284
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,960
This isn't just about automation,
it's about in automation, and next

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,310
will go scalability, then comes
scalability as your business grows.

286
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,680
So the volume of data, the number of
users, and the complexity of your cloud

287
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,170
services, your integration platform must
handle this growth without slowing down.

288
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,110
For business a requirement,
a full architecture.

289
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,550
It should adapt dynamically
as your environmental evolves.

290
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,740
Think like choosing a bridge that
not only handled today traffic,

291
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,180
but is ready for tomorrow.

292
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,020
Rush showers and next vendor independence.

293
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,310
Finally, we took for vendor independence.

294
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,410
Your integration solutions should have
flexible architecture that doesn't tie.

295
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,540
You one cloud to other cloud, which
ensure portability of our cloud.

296
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,560
Easier migrations, our expansions, and
better dealing with the cloud vendors.

297
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,220
We'll go with next slide.

298
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,100
Performance optimization techniques,
making multi-cloud ran smarter and posture

299
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,470
once the right integration platform is
in place, the next step is performing

300
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,780
optimization, making the next step.

301
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:24,895
Multi-cloud environments not
only works, but work faster,

302
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:27,325
efficiently and intelligently.

303
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:29,635
AI plays a major role here.

304
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:35,155
We uses a combination of small
technologies to boost systems performance

305
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:41,624
by 40 to 60%, and I would like to work
through the four key techniques we use.

306
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:45,164
The first one is predictive
resources allocation.

307
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,504
The first technique is predictive.

308
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,929
Resources allocation.

309
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:56,109
So in this technique, a constantly
analyzes system phase and forecast

310
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:02,379
upcoming demand, whether it's a
storage, compute, or bandwidth based

311
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:07,809
on automatic, a automatically scales
resources up or down in real time.

312
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,789
This means you avoid performance
button, like during peak traffic,

313
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,339
and you also save cost during.

314
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:18,249
Quite period, but not overing.

315
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,979
Next is data filtering.

316
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,959
Instead of trans transferring
and processing all data, it

317
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:30,489
determines what relevant and
filter out unnecessary information

318
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:32,139
before it moves between systems.

319
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,569
This reduces network traffic storage
we and data processing loads.

320
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,629
Think if going through your
inbox and only keeping the

321
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,919
important emails automatically.

322
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,049
And next one is then we
integrated edge computing.

323
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,719
This means the data is processed
close to its source at the edge of

324
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:58,019
the network, rather than sending
everything back to the cloud.

325
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,459
Benefits like faster response
times reduces latency and

326
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:06,899
improve performance for real time
applications like retail transactions.

327
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:12,029
And finally, we use adapt to compressions.

328
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:20,159
A Dan Kelly compress data based on the
content network conditions, based on the

329
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,169
network conditions and priority level.

330
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,559
This ensure faster transfer, especially
across regions or providers, and

331
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,259
helps optimize bandwidth usage.

332
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:35,729
We get faster performance with less
traffic without compromising our data.

333
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,269
Going to next slide.

334
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,529
Case study, financial
services transformation.

335
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,899
Let's look at the real world example.

336
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:51,329
With a power integration in place,
the transformation was dramatic.

337
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,149
Integration time dropped by 87.

338
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:59,309
Percentage when took weeks, now
took just days or even ours,

339
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,099
thanks to automated data mapping.

340
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:07,994
And in routing data reduces
by 86 percentage A identified.

341
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:14,729
And corrected inconsistent in real
time leading to clean and more reliable

342
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,969
data complaints cost fell sharply.

343
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,079
Self-learning policies, engines
ensure that all systems stayed

344
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,059
aligned with the regulations.

345
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,299
Reducing manual effort and audit
related stress system uptime improved

346
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,249
significantly with prior to monitoring
and intelligent troubleshooting

347
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:37,799
out has become rare and recover.

348
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:39,224
Was much faster.

349
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:42,854
I will go with next slide.

350
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:48,404
Emerging technologies,
reshaping integration.

351
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:52,394
As we look to the future, it's
clear that a driven integration

352
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,384
is just the beginning.

353
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:58,394
A new view of emerging technologies
is reshaping how we manage data

354
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:02,414
systems and security across the cloud,
and it happened faster than ever.

355
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,084
Let me briefly walk you.

356
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,534
Four powerful technologies
that are revolutionary, the

357
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,094
next generation of integration.

358
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,764
The first one is autonomous operations.

359
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:16,934
First, we have autonomous operations,
what we often call self-healing system.

360
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:23,564
Imagine a system that detects an error
and it's won, identify the root cause,

361
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:29,234
and fixes the issue automatically
without waiting for human interventions.

362
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:34,124
These systems uses AI to monitor
operational in real time.

363
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:37,664
Learn from past instance
and adapt continuously.

364
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:42,734
It's like having an IT team
that never sleeps, never makes

365
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,634
mistakes and resolution problems
before users even notice.

366
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:48,074
And next one.

367
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,844
Second, we have edge computing,
a powerful approach where data

368
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:58,244
is processed at near their source
instead of central cloud system.

369
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:02,009
This is especially
useful for smart retail.

370
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,349
Real-time monitoring in healthcare
are manufacturing next year is

371
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,249
blockchain security in multi-cloud
and hybrid environments.

372
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,649
Trust and editable are critical.

373
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:17,009
Blockchain provides
immutable audit trials.

374
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,179
Records that can be changed are
added across cloud providers.

375
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:28,289
This creators cross-platform trust for
transactions and access better compliance

376
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:30,539
tracking and stronger productions.

377
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,709
Again, data.

378
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,244
Data time bring manipulating.

379
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:38,354
It brings transparency and
integration to data workflow

380
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,664
no matter where the data lies.

381
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:46,094
And finally, we have cognitive
integration, a concept that

382
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,974
brings natural language
understanding to cloud operations.

383
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:54,344
Imagine your voice comments are plain
English into managed cloud services.

384
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:59,264
For example, show me all fail
integrations five this morning, or.

385
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:04,484
Secure all healthcare data
with GDPR level encryption.

386
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:08,684
This makes cloud management more
accessible and user-friendly, even

387
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,724
for non-technical stakeholders.

388
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:13,754
Go to next slide.

389
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:15,944
Implementation roadmap.

390
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:18,974
A phase path of a driven integration.

391
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:23,624
Now that we explored the status
strategy, technologies and

392
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:26,609
benefits of a. Power integration.

393
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:30,719
The next big question is how
do we put it all into actions?

394
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:36,899
We follow a structure phase roadmap
that ensure that transitions to a driven

395
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:41,519
integration is smooth, measurable,
and aligned with business priorities.

396
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:45,029
Let me break down each phase
of implementation roadmap.

397
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,439
So the phase one discovery,
four to six weeks.

398
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,429
In this first phase we took
time to fully understand.

399
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:57,574
The current environment, we access
our existing cloud infrastructure

400
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:03,904
review integration points, identify
pain points, security gaps and

401
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:08,494
inefficiencies, and define clear
business and technical requirements.

402
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:14,074
This phase gives us foundation for
small decision making and phase

403
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:16,474
two foundation eight to 10 weeks.

404
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:21,064
So once we define the need, we
move to foundation phase here.

405
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:26,254
We deploy the core integration platform,
connect your primary systems, whether

406
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:33,904
AWS Azure, GCP, or on-prem, and
establish basic data flow and monitoring.

407
00:29:34,714 --> 00:29:38,494
This step is all about getting
the system, talking to each

408
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:41,824
other in stable, scalable way.

409
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,994
And phase three, a enhancement
six to eight weeks.

410
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,674
Now we bring into real.

411
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:49,489
Power AI automation.

412
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:56,089
In this phase, we implement automated data
mapping, enabling indi data routing, set

413
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:01,099
up self-learning policies, enforcement
and configure ready to monitoring.

414
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,939
This is where we start seeing
significant performance gains and

415
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:07,399
reduce error and foster operations.

416
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,909
Your system becomes
more and more proactive.

417
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,529
And I final up phase
four, optimizing ongoing.

418
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,229
And finally, we, the journey doesn't stop.

419
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:22,679
With the implementation, we move
into a continuous optimizing phase

420
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,139
where we monitor performance metrics,
analyze system behavior, and fine

421
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,219
tune integration platform for
even better results forward time.

422
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:35,969
This ensure the system grow
with our business adopts to

423
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,499
change and keeps improving.

424
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:41,669
Going to next slide, key takeaways.

425
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:46,884
So transforming your
multi-cloud strategy with ai.

426
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:53,124
As we come to close off the session,
let's take a moment to recap the takeaway,

427
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:56,964
the core message that can help transform
your multi-cloud strategy using ai.

428
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,874
