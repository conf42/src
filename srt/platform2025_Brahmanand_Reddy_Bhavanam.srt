1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,429
Good evening everyone.

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:05,569
My name is Bra Reddy and I'm
working as a jaw developer with

3
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:07,220
the Department of Veterans Office.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,500
Today I'll be sharing a presentation
on secure distributed healthcare

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,050
platforms fiscally how blockchain
powered infrastructure is

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,189
reshaping next generation medical
systems by improving security,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,880
interoperability and patient trust.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,070
Coming to the evolution of healthcare
infrastructure, traditional healthcare

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,760
systems were built a decades
ago around centralized database

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,710
and proprietary technologies.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,720
This work when data volumes were smaller,
but today's reality is very different.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,670
Every hospital generates
terabytes of data from electronic

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,410
healthcare records, imaging.

14
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:47,064
Variable devices and
remote patient monitoring.

15
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:52,074
Centralized models struggle to handle
this growth leading to the bottleneck in

16
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,955
access, interoperability, and security.

17
00:00:55,735 --> 00:01:01,015
For example if a patient moves from North
Carolina to California, their medical

18
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,024
history doesn't move with them easily.

19
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:07,765
Data is fragmented across
different providers with limited

20
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:09,410
mechanisms for real time exchanges.

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,710
Centralized systems are also prime
target for cybersecurity, which have

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,440
increased dramatically in healthcare.

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,399
In fact, ransomware incidents
in US hospitals double between

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,699
2021 and 2023 highlighting the
risks of single point of failure.

25
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:29,610
Blockchain offers a paradigm shift.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,009
It distributes trust across multiple
nodes, ensuring that no single.

27
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,520
Entity controls or compromises the system.

28
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:44,450
The immutable nature of blockchain
means medical data cannot be

29
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,190
altered retroactively, which is
critical for trust in healthcare.

30
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:55,520
In short, we move from institution
centric soil database to resilient

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,219
distributor, patient-centric models.

32
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,609
Architecture foundations, the
blockchain powered healthcare platforms

33
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,439
rest on four foundation layers.

34
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:10,479
Blockchain layer provides a code
distributed legit that ensure

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,279
immutable and transparency.

36
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:18,369
Every transaction, whether it's EHR,
update or a prescription is recorded

37
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,849
permanently conscious mechanism.

38
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:27,344
In healthcare, proof of authority is
often preferred since trust institutions

39
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:33,854
validate transactions, it faster than
proof of work and aligns with complaints.

40
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:40,054
Smart contacts automate agreements,
for example, insurance claims

41
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:43,954
can be processed automatically
when clinical data is uploaded.

42
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:49,264
Similarly, trial consent can be
tracked and enforced automatically.

43
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,669
The photo type is data architecture
due to the privacy law.

44
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,789
Sensitive patient data typically remains
off chain while cryptographic proofs

45
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,249
and metadata are stored on chain.

46
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,779
This hybrid models balances
privacy with the auditable.

47
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:14,919
Together, this elements create secure,
sensible, and regulatory foundation that

48
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,834
traditional healthcare, it cannot match.

49
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,594
Infrastructure as a code.

50
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,984
Healthcare is one of the
most regulated industries.

51
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:27,094
Any infrastructure change must be
auditable, reproducible and secure.

52
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,704
This is where infrastructure
as a code shines.

53
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,684
Using Docker and Kubernetes healthcare
organization can ensure applications

54
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:39,394
running consistent environments
critical for clinical reliability.

55
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:43,674
Terraform provisions infrastructure
across multiple cloud providers

56
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:49,374
while Ansible enforces standardized
security and compliance policies.

57
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,154
Why is this important?

58
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:55,204
Imagine a hospital rollout,
a blockchain enabled.

59
00:03:55,204 --> 00:04:00,554
EHR across multiple states without
infrastructure has a code every.

60
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:05,044
Deployment would require manual
configuration prone to errors and

61
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,894
inconsistencies with the infrastructure.

62
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:12,584
As a code, the rollout is automated
consistent and fully traceable.

63
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:16,634
Additionally, infrastructure as a
code supports disaster recovery.

64
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:23,294
If one data center fails, configurations
can be redeployed in a minute elsewhere.

65
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:28,159
Combined with the GitHub's workflows,
every change is version control.

66
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:32,099
Providing full transparency
and rollback compatibilities.

67
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,439
This approach only reduces, not
only reduces operation risk,

68
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:41,579
but also satisfied stringent
compliance requirements like hipaa.

69
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:46,504
We are audit trails and
reproducibility are non-negotiable,

70
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:47,674
negotiable.

71
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,594
DevOps, integration,
DevOps, and healthcare.

72
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,249
Blockchain is not business as usual.

73
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:57,944
It has to balance rapid innovations
with strict regulations and

74
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:00,574
patient safety specialized testing.

75
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:05,504
Automated suit checks for smart contacts,
vulnerabilities, HIPAA compliance,

76
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:08,174
and clinical workflow integration.

77
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:14,655
For example, before rolling out a new EHR
integration, the system stimulates how

78
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,189
it would handle actual patient scenarios.

79
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:18,929
Future flags.

80
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,489
New blockchain features can be tested
with the limited patient groups

81
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,179
before a full rollout if issue arises.

82
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:32,579
Rollback is immediate, secure
integration, continuous static, dynamic

83
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:38,009
analysis, sincere vulnerabilities like
accident, patient data exposure, and

84
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,229
detected early release management.

85
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:45,699
Unlike typical software
healthcare, religious often

86
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,869
require clinical stakeholders sign
off and regulatory notification.

87
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,989
This is safety First development Pipeline.

88
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:58,909
Innovation continues, but no
change compromises compliance,

89
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,674
privacy, or patient safety.

90
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,214
EHR integration.

91
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:08,614
Electronic healthcare records are the
backbone of modern healthcare, but

92
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:13,174
they are flagged by interoperability
and patient access issues.

93
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:16,924
Patient often doesn't
even want their records.

94
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:17,824
Hospitals do.

95
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:22,684
Patient enables say, patient-centric
model where individuals control

96
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,484
access is smart Contacts.

97
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:30,709
Patients can grant temporary
access to specialist insurance.

98
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,719
I insurers or researchers.

99
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,019
For example, a cancer patient
could allow her oncologist to.

100
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:42,554
In one hospital and a clinical trial
team in another to secure view their

101
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:48,284
medical history without central transfer
of sense to data Integration with

102
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,774
FHIR standards ensure compatibility
with existing health IT systems.

103
00:06:54,194 --> 00:07:00,194
The blockchain is not replacing EHR, but
act as a trust and access layer, verifying

104
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:05,564
identities, recording permissions,
and insuring data proven provenance.

105
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:10,324
This model improves auditability,
cross institution sharing and

106
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:14,989
trust a step towards true patient,
so native or medical data,

107
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:15,889
clinical trials.

108
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:20,954
Clinical trials face major
issues, data tampering, lack of

109
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,784
transparency, and patient trust.

110
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:27,314
Blockchain addresses all
this immutable audit trails.

111
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:32,324
Ensure trial data cannot be
retroactively altered is occurred

112
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:38,114
against fraud, smart contracts,
automated con consent, milestone

113
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,104
payments, and regulatory reporting.

114
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:44,934
Imagine a. A participating
enrollment in a study.

115
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:52,194
Their consent is recorded, immu immutably,
and the compensation is automatically

116
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,204
triggered with milestones are met.

117
00:07:54,704 --> 00:08:00,524
Patient remain control since selectively
sharing relevant data with research

118
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:06,064
institutions, regulatory agencies, to
real time compliance notifications.

119
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:11,764
This transparency build trust among
patients participants, researchers

120
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:17,554
and regulators accelerating trial
approval and ensuring integrity.

121
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:19,674
Supply chain verification.

122
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:23,624
Counterfeit ducks cost,
global healthcare industry.

123
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:28,754
200 billion annually and
endangered millions of lives.

124
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,874
Blockchain enables supply chain combat.

125
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:35,144
This pro product authentication.

126
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:40,419
Each drug device receives a
digital fingerprint verifiable

127
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:41,709
by anyone in the chain.

128
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,829
Co cold chain monitoring.

129
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:49,549
Okay, IO OT Sensors record
storage, temperature critical for

130
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,819
vaccines and data logged immutably.

131
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:58,509
Recall management fault batches
can be instantly identified and

132
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,300
trace back avoiding mass recalls.

133
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:06,790
For example, during COVID-19
vaccine rollouts, maintaining cold

134
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,069
chain integrity was vital block.

135
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,390
Chain back to iot integration.

136
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,719
Ensure such transparency
and accountability,

137
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,319
security and privacy technologies.

138
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:24,020
Healthcare data is the most
valuable type of personal data.

139
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:28,489
Fetching highest prices than
credit card on the black market.

140
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,814
The blockchain performs employ
multi-layer security encryption,

141
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:40,744
signature multi-factor authentication,
d. D, voice protection, and instruction

142
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:44,604
detection for privacy advanced methods.

143
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:48,234
Hello, useful analysis
without exposing raw data.

144
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,734
Zero knowledge proof.

145
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,784
Prove a condition without
sharing the record.

146
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:59,654
Differential privacy, add noise to
aggregated queries to protect individuals.

147
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:02,824
Secure multi-party computations.

148
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:06,904
Let multiple hospitals collaborate
on analysis without revealing

149
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:08,134
their patient data set.

150
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:13,854
This is crucial because healthcare
must balance utility of data

151
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,469
with strict confidentiality.

152
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:19,499
Compliance automations compliance
consumes enormous resource.

153
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,339
In healthcare.

154
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:26,849
Blockchain automates much of this
HIPAA smart contracts and force minimum

155
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:32,609
necessary data access, logging all
activity, GDPR off change storage with

156
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:36,019
the cryptographic tools like Kimon.

157
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,449
Ensure right to be forgotten is feasible.

158
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:45,654
Consent management, patient
privacy preferences, updates

159
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,214
instantly across systems.

160
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:51,264
Quality reporting metrics are
automatically collected and

161
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,604
submitted to agencies like CMS.

162
00:10:54,564 --> 00:11:00,654
This automatic automation reduces manual
paperwork, lower cost, and decreases

163
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:06,189
human errors while ensuring regulatory
trustworthy real time foresight.

164
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,149
Okay, performance and scalability.

165
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,849
A common criticism of blockchain is
scalability, healthcare demands, high

166
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:21,239
throughput and realtime Performance
solutions include conscious optimization,

167
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:27,819
practical fault tolerance, and should
both speed and security late to scaling.

168
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,089
Site change handles specialized workloads.

169
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,769
Example, clinical trials, which state
channel processing microtransactions data

170
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:44,879
optimization and catching hybrid models
store heavy medical data efficiently

171
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,869
while keeping blockchain locks light.

172
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,389
Together, this ensure blockchain
platforms can scale for national,

173
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,249
even global healthcare systems.

174
00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:01,390
Internet of medical things, billions of
internet of medical things divides us

175
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:07,719
like pager makers, wearables, glucose
monitors, gendered data streams.

176

Mesh globalization of healthcare
from medical tourism to international

188
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:59,444
research requires sensitive across
global broader data exchange.

189
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:00,944
The challenges.

190
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:06,095
Different privacy laws, localization
requirements, and interoperability grabs

191
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:12,055
federated Blockchain networks solve
this by maintaining data sovereignty.

192
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:17,665
Records stay within the country, but can
be verified across borders, supporting

193
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:24,390
emergency care, coordinating for
traveling patients, enabling large scale.

194
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,870
Global research collaborations
while respecting local laws.

195
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,950
For example, during global Pandemics,
such a mesh code, safe data sharing

196
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,960
without violating sovereignty.

197
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,600
Future directions.

198
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,090
Blockchain in healthcare is
evolving alongside emerging tech.

199
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,550
Quantum computing rises risk
for encryption, so quantum.

200
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,105
Algorithms are needed.

201
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,305
AI integrations, federal
learning, federated learning,

202
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:59,095
plus differential privacy.

203
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:03,175
Yellow AI to try non distributed
data without exposing patients.

204
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,975
Extended reality.

205
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:09,505
Secure verification for
AR or VR medical training.

206
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:15,055
DYA governance distributed
decision making among providers,

207
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,395
insurance patients, sustainability.

208
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:22,445
It shifted towards energy
efficient to cut carbon footprint.

209
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:29,375
Regulations, framework will adopt,
requiring flexible blockchain platforms.

210
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:34,205
This future is not just about
technologies, but about governance,

211
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,605
ethics, and sustainability in healthcare.
