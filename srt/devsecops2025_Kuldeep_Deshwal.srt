1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,950
Okay.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,730
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,630
My name is Khali Dewa.

4
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,730
I am director of engineering at
Proofpoint, and I'll be talking about

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,469
developer productivity and the common
pitfalls with this presentation.

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,144
Now, developers, the most
important asset for any company

7
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,004
delivering software as product.

8
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:24,814
Making sure that they're set
up for success is the key

9
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,824
to ensuring overall success.

10
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:32,245
Now, we can't lean into this discussion
without knowing that what is it

11
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:34,015
that the developers really value?

12
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:39,685
Studies after studies have revealed
that developers crave meaningful impact.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:44,095
They like to understand big
picture and how their contributions

14
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:45,895
help drive long-term outcomes.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,050
Now with that context in mind, let's
lean into the most common pitfalls

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,180
of driving their productivity.

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,739
Let's start with the ones we stumble
on as managers on this front.

18
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,339
Now, some of the managers like to dig deep
and want to be involved in every detail.

19
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:08,539
Various studies have proven that
this is a massive anti-pattern

20
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:09,350
for that productivity.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,170
In addition to that, obsessing
our metrics has been the trend of

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,710
our times, but like all trends,
it has some pros and cons to it.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,980
Looking at the metrics such as prs,
commits, deploys, lines of code velocity,

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,500
all of these numbers without context
can drive a lot of unintended behavior.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,390
Next, let's look at things
from tooling point of view.

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,880
Given how the role of developer
has evolved over the years.

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,310
With the DevOps DevSecOps observability
movement, it has left a lot on

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,810
an average developer's plate.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,080
Now, all of this means that devs have to
do a lot of context switching throughout

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,390
the day while dealing with a lot of tools.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,850
This can be the biggest drain.

32
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:03,325
On an asset for dev productivity,
depending on how the tooling is

33
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:08,185
set up and if the culture and
tooling is set up with empathy and

34
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:09,595
respect for developer workflow.

35
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,695
Next is prioritization
related related pitfalls.

36
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:19,430
Now setting a processes and automation to
shift left security concerns is critical.

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,300
Otherwise, developers are
always playing catch up.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,510
Now, given the range of tooling, types of
vulnerabilities, threats, surface area,

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,880
if this is not set up correctly, this can
significantly drag down dev productivity.

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,530
In addition to that, this is well known
that tech debt, if not addressed in time,

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,080
can snowball and become a major roadblock,
severely impacting the depth productivity.

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,800
Huh.

43
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,115
After all, we all know that it
takes a lot longer to make any

44
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,765
changes to those legacy apps.

45
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:55,065
Okay, next one touches on things
from arcs at a point of view.

46
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:59,495
Now, with the kind of speed tech
landscape evolves, it is very natural

47
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:05,325
for learning gaps and organizational
silos to show up now to deal with that.

48
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,370
It is important to proactively set
up processes and forums that can

49
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,070
help drive collaboration and help
devs keep up with evolving tooling.

50
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,130
A more recent example on this
front is AI based code gen tools.

51
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,070
The tools in this space are evolving and
getting better every day, leaving depths

52
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,560
to play catch up almost all the time.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,430
Now, while we are busy breaking silos.

54
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:40,385
In catching up, it is also critical
to make sure that the teams and

55
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:44,645
organizations are set up with
the developer wellbeing in mind.

56
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:50,425
All right, now that we have examined the
pitfalls, let's discuss the four pillars

57
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,995
of sustainable dev productivity activity.

58
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:59,085
Now, metrics are still the key,
but here we need to make sure that.

59
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:04,905
We are tying up activity based
metrics with the outcomes.

60
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:09,365
In addition to that, developer
is a creative endeavor.

61
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:14,385
Autonomy and trust are at
the heart of development.

62
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:19,355
Now, none of that will work unless
the goals and the respective

63
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:23,255
business outcomes that the company
is trying to chase are spelled out.

64
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:24,355
Clarity.

65
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:29,615
While we have clarity, trust, and
context-based measures, we still

66
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:33,005
need to keep up with the trends of
the time with continuous learning.

67
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:34,045
Okay?

68
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:35,815
Easier said than done.

69
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,835
What's needed to execute
sustainable productivity?

70
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:43,115
Now, for practical execution,
we need to make sure that we

71
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,225
have context based picture.

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,430
Of the productivity metrics.

73
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,900
Now we can ensure that by
collecting qualitative metrics

74
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,280
with quantitative metrics.

75
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,150
In addition to that, we study the
variety of reasons across organization

76
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,480
that lead to context switching, and
that rather trigger triggers, context

77
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,565
switching and then take action or
diagnose appropriately at the same time.

78
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:14,595
We set a platform, tooling and
automation in a way that it creates

79
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:19,095
minimal cognitive load on the devs
trying to deliver customer features.

80
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:24,455
Now, to build a sustainable flow with
the four pillars at the beginning, we

81
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:29,825
need clarity of goals, then autonomy
of execution, next, measurable

82
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,925
outcomes to track the progress.

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,470
And while all of that's going on,
we need to continuously invest

84
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,180
in the growth of our depths.

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,590
All right, we are at the
tail end of the presentation.

86
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,710
So finally, I'd like to conclude by saying
that for any engineering organization to

87
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,260
be successful, empathy and respect for
developers and developer workflow should

88
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,420
be front and center of the culture or
planning and customer value delivery.

89
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,530
Thank you everyone.
