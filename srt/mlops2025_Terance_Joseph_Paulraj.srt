1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,710
Hello everyone, and thank
you for joining this session.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,950
My name is Terrance Stan, Joseph Ra.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,350
I specialize in enterprise data
architecture, cloud data engineering,

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,600
and AI driven business intelligence.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,550
I bring close to 25 years of
experience in building data

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,370
systems for global organizations.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,320
The title of today talk is Yaya
Driven Enterprise Intelligence.

8
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,125
Enabling real time decision making.

9
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:36,485
In ops, the topic is important
because businesses cannot

10
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,705
depend on slow reports anymore.

11
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:43,085
By the time traditional
insight reach leaders, the

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,185
opportunity may already be gone.

13
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:52,470
What organization need is real time
intelligence data that is processed

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,815
instantly analyzed with the ai.

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,125
And acted on right way.

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:02,305
The next 30 minutes, I will
walk you through four areas, how

17
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:04,224
enterprise intelligence has evolved.

18
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:10,945
The building blocks secured the role
of responsible ai, and finally, your

19
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,835
practical roadmap to make it real.

20
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:19,634
By the end, you will see how a and
ML lops together enable smarter,

21
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,065
faster, and more reliable decisions.

22
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,395
Here is the agenda for today's session.

23
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:28,345
We will start with evaluation
of enterprise intelligence.

24
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:33,805
I will explain how organization
move from retrospective reporting

25
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:39,195
to real time decision systems and
why these safety is necessary next.

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,530
We will explore the building
blocks of AI driven intelligence.

27
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,640
This includes distributed
processing, machine learning

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,280
models and automated workflows.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,039
They form the core technology that
makes real time decision possibles.

30
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:00,979
After that, I will discuss
responsible, yay, a implementation

31
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,879
as yay A becomes more powerful.

32
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,909
It also raises ethical questions.

33
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:13,329
We need governance, transparency,
and trust to make sure these

34
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,459
systems are used responsibly.

35
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,369
Finally, we will cover a
practical amount of blueprint.

36
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:26,419
This includes architecture, integration
strategies, and an implementation

37
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:29,449
roadmap that organizations can follow.

38
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,649
My goal is not only to explain concepts.

39
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:38,414
But also to give you a practical
takeaways, by the end of this session,

40
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:42,914
you should have a clear picture
of how enterprise intelligence

41
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:45,074
can transform organizations.

42
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:45,694
I,

43
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:50,259
let's begin with the sif from
retrospective intelligence to real

44
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,199
time intelligence for many years.

45
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:57,279
Traditional business intelligence
only looked backward.

46
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,229
It was based on historical data
and shared through periodic

47
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:05,109
reports daily, weekly, or monthly.

48
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,449
The common issue was delayed.

49
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,809
By the time leaders received this report.

50
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,974
The situation had already changed.

51
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:18,570
Traditional BA answered the question,
what happened, but gave little

52
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,910
guidance on what should we do now?

53
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,720
Real time enterprise
intelligence changes this.

54
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,180
It takes continuous data steams
and process them as they arrive.

55
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,450
This allow organization to react
immediately, not hours or days later.

56
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,370
Yay.

57
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,475
A take this even further.

58
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:43,165
Predictive analytics highlight what
is likely to happen while prescriptive

59
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:45,570
analytics recommend the best Next action.

60
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,889
Some of these actions
can even be automated.

61
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:55,419
For example, fraud detection system
systems, it can block suspicious activity

62
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,089
in real time without human review.

63
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:03,389
The sift from descriptive reporting to
predictive and prescriptive intelligent

64
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:08,154
is the core difference between yesterday's
BI and today's AA driven systems.

65
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:13,414
Enterprise intelligence become
powerful when poor parts come together.

66
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,544
The first is CAM models.

67
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:20,224
These are algorithms that recognize
patents, predict outcomes,

68
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,174
and generate useful insights.

69
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:26,734
Without them, the data
stays raw and underused.

70
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,464
The second is Yamal Lab's practices.

71
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,804
This ensures model.

72
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,364
Don't just stay in research.

73
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,654
They are deployed, monitor,
and updated as needed.

74
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,784
YMO allows, makes AA relatable
and ready for business use.

75
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,769
The third is realtime processing.

76
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:49,454
Instead of waiting for overnight report,
data is processed as soon as it arrives.

77
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:54,374
This give business agility
and immediate responses.

78
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:56,894
The fourth is government.

79
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,844
Governance provides rules,
accountability and compliance.

80
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:06,124
It makes sure YAYA systems are
ethical, explainable, and trusted.

81
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:13,824
When all four intersect Y models, your
labs realtime processing and governance,

82
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:20,614
we get enterprise intelligent that is
fast, scalable, and trustworthy, missing

83
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,529
even one piece weakens the system.

84
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:27,244
Together, they create the
foundation for smarter, faster,

85
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,494
and more sustainable decisions.

86
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:30,204
Yay.

87
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:34,194
Driven, intelligent is built
on three main building blocks.

88
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:37,344
The first is distributor data processing.

89
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:42,264
Large amounts of data need to be
processed quickly and reliably.

90
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:48,454
Tools like a Kafa Spark Streaming
and road services make this possible.

91
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:53,424
They handle steams of information
at scale with very little delay.

92
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,965
The second is machine learning models.

93
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:57,825
This can be symbol.

94
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:01,544
Statistical models are advanced
deep planning net worth.

95
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:06,515
They find patterns, predict
outcomes, and recommend actions.

96
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:11,635
Models can focus, demand,
produce, customer churn, or

97
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,164
detect fraud in real time.

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,304
The third is automated decision workflows.

99
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:21,364
Once insights are generated,
they must be turned into actions.

100
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:27,729
Rule engines, region re enforcement
landing, and automation tools

101
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,194
help systems act on insights
without waiting for humans.

102
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,389
Especially for routine decisions.

103
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,074
When combined these three elements,
processing, modeling, and workflows turn

104
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:46,584
raw data into real time intelligence,
they are the foundation of enterprise

105
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,704
systems that can add, not just report

106
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,214
many organization.

107
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,804
Start their Yay journey with small pilots.

108
00:06:55,644 --> 00:07:00,084
These pilots often sit in silos
managed by different teams

109
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,554
with the little coordination.

110
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,024
This leads to duplicate
efforts, inconsistent

111
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,244
practices, and wasted resources.

112
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,624
The next stage is integrated platforms.

113
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:15,204
Here, organization move away
from scattered pilots and

114
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,314
use shared infrastructure.

115
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,894
They standardize processes, connect
data pipelines, and encourage

116
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,024
collaboration across departments.

117
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:27,034
This reduces duplication
and increases efficiency.

118
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,884
The most advanced stages.

119
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:31,449
Enterprise intelligence at this level.

120
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:32,309
Yay.

121
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,359
A models, data and workflows
all operate together.

122
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:40,459
Insights from one area, such
as supply chain can directly

123
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,679
inform another area like finance.

124
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:48,059
Customer insights can influence product
decisions in the journey moves from

125
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:54,089
fragmented pilots to integrated platforms,
and finally to enterprise intelligence.

126
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,699
The real value comes at the
final stage when embedded into

127
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,674
everybody business process.

128
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:04,074
That's when organization unlock
the full power of intelligence.

129
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:05,924
Let me ask you this.

130
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:11,494
How often have you tried to get the data
and felt stuck with technical tools?

131
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,094
Most people don't want to write queries.

132
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,354
They just want answers.

133
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:19,064
This is where natural language
interfaces play a role.

134
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:24,774
They let people interact with systems
using normal conversation, for example.

135
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:29,964
Yeah, manager can ask, what
were our sales last week?

136
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,504
Under this, the system
can answer instantly.

137
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:33,854
Even with the chart.

138
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,064
These enterprises do more than qa.

139
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:42,564
They understand intent, recognized
domain terms and work across multiple

140
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,144
models like text chart or wise.

141
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:48,824
They act as the bridge
between humans and ai.

142
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:54,744
The benefit is democratization,
cell service, analytics, operational

143
00:08:54,834 --> 00:09:00,859
health, workflow automation, all become
available to employees at every level.

144
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:07,409
Not just technical experts by lowering
barriers, natural language, inter

145
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,379
interfaces bring AI into daily work.

146
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,879
They make interface intelligence
easier to use, so that data driven

147
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,369
decision become part of everyone's job.

148
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:23,049
Now let us see how these
ideas work in real industries.

149
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,834
In financial services, Yaya
detects fraud in real time, often

150
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,874
stopping it before damage is done.

151
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:36,584
Algorithm trading reacts faster
than any human and banks personalize

152
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,904
services for each customer.

153
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,844
In healthcare, yay.

154
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,724
A helps doctor with clinical decisions.

155
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:49,964
It predict patient's risk resource use in
hospitals, and even support personalized

156
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:55,944
treatment plans in retail companies
use a, a for dynamic pricing, inventory

157
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,134
optimization and personalized shopping.

158
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,854
It also improves supply chain flexibility.

159
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:06,664
Helping stores stay stock even
during disruptions in manufacturing.

160
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,024
Predictive maintenance
prevents costly breakdowns.

161
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:15,574
Quality checks becomes automated, and
production is optimist for efficiency.

162
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,084
Each industry has unique needs,
but the foundation is same.

163
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:23,799
Real time data a model,
and automated workflows.

164
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,069
This source, the flexibility of enterprise
intelligence, no matter the field.

165
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,429
These tools help organization move faster,
serve customers better, and save cost.

166
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,454
Now let me ask, would
you trust your system?

167
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,684
That is fast because,
but unfair, probably not.

168
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,594
That's why responsible Yay is the
foundation of enterprise intelligence.

169
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:53,824
Businesses depend on trust, and trust
comes from doing yay the right way.

170
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,494
Governance is the first.

171
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,274
Clear rules and review processes.

172
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:02,094
Make sure someone is
accountable for every bottle.

173
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,824
Fairness means testing for bias
and ensuring decisions are balanced

174
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,474
across different groups of people.

175
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:13,299
Explainability allows leader to
understand why the system gave you a

176
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:19,109
certain output instead of treating it
like a black fox, complaints ensure we

177
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:25,549
follow laws like GDPR, industry rules
and privacy protections with those

178
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:32,899
responsible AI system risk failure
lawsuits or loss of reputations.

179
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:37,494
With IT organization gain trust
from customers, regulator,

180
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:40,454
and employees responsible.

181
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:42,434
Yay is not optional.

182
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,874
It is what makes enterprise
INT intelligence safe,

183
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,404
ethical, and sustainable.

184
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:51,319
One of the hardest challenging is
balancing performance with ethics.

185
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:58,269
Businesses always want more accuracy,
but sometimes the most accurate model is

186
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,849
not the fairest or easiest to explain.

187
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:06,529
The first step is to map trade
off, recognize where accuracy might

188
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,019
conflict with fairness and privacy.

189
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,659
The second step is multi
objective optimization.

190
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:19,824
Discerning models that optimize across
several goals, not just accuracy.

191
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:27,854
The third step is stakeholder input, legal
teams, ethics boards, and even end users

192
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:30,644
should have a say in what is acceptable.

193
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,874
Finally, we need continuous evaluation.

194
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:35,649
Our society changes.

195
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,034
What is fact today may
not be fact tomorrow.

196
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:46,304
The goal is not for perfection in one
area, but balance across all by making

197
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:49,454
this decision openly and documenting them.

198
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:53,864
Organization build DIA, systems
that are strong in performance,

199
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,904
but also ethical and trusted.

200
00:12:56,404 --> 00:13:00,514
That balance is what sustains
enterprise intelligence over time.

201
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,744
Let's look at what the
architecture of enterprise

202
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,514
intelligence actually looks like.

203
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:08,744
It begins with cloud
native infrastructure.

204
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:12,454
Containerization makes sure
models run the same everywhere.

205
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:18,859
Kubernetes managers scaling and serverless
functions allow even driven processing.

206
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:23,285
And infrastructure as code
keeps everything reproducible.

207
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:28,545
The second layer is data architecture,
even streaming backbones, like

208
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,444
Oris carry data in real time.

209
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,524
Features, tools, keep models
supplied with fresh inputs, laco

210
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,274
patents, campaign structure, and
unstructured data in one system.

211
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:42,994
Data contracts ensure consistency.

212
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,459
And prevent errors together.

213
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,109
This creates a strong foundation
data flow continuously.

214
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Models always have the latest
information and the infrastructure

215
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,620
grows as business needs expand.

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,869
Think of it like building not
just a single building, but

217
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,640
a whole city of intelligence.

218
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,230
Each part connect supports
others and scales together.

219
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:11,170
That is a kind of blueprint needed
for modern enterprise intelligence.

220
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,699
Now that vehicle seen the architecture,
let's talk about how machine learning

221
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,124
integrates into business systems.

222
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:21,130
First step is continuous integration.

223
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,475
Every time your model or
data pipeline changes.

224
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:30,495
It must be tested automatically
this quality and avoids

225
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,785
the prices in production.

226
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:37,025
The second step is continuous delivery
models move from development to

227
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:41,585
production in a repeatable process
with version control and validation.

228
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:45,685
Gates, this prevents error
when rolling out new updates.

229
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,744
The third feature is management.

230
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:51,395
Using feature flax are canary deployments.

231
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:56,449
Organization can test new
models on a similar scale before

232
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,099
rolling them out to everyone.

233
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:02,560
Finally, monitoring and
observation is essential.

234
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:10,109
We track not the system performance,
but also businesses outcome data

235
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:17,149
drift and model accuracy integration
ensures ideas don't stay in notebooks.

236
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:23,554
It turns experiments into working systems
that support real business decisions.

237
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:28,694
We thought integration
innovation starts with it.

238
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,364
AI becomes part of everyday operations.

239
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:31,394
I

240
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:34,229
should DAA make decision fully on its own.

241
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,439
The answer depends on the situation.

242
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:36,559
Okay.

243
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,569
Some cases work well
with full automations.

244
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:46,089
These are high volume row risk
decisions like filtering, spam

245
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,609
or flaking duplicate records.

246
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,424
Other cases need a human in the loop.

247
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:56,289
Yaya give recommendation, but
humans approve the final decisions.

248
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:02,039
This is common in medium risk areas like
loan approvals or medical test reviews.

249
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:06,609
Then yeah, there are Yaya
augmented decisions here.

250
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:10,479
Yaya provide insights, but
humans stay in control.

251
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:16,589
For example, your Dr. May use AA
to highlight areas in the scan, but

252
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,259
doctors still makes the final energies.

253
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,099
The key is matching automation with risk.

254
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,219
Low risk tasks can be automated.

255
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:27,504
Highest stakes tasks must involve people.

256
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:32,064
These balances give organization
both speed and accountability.

257
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:36,364
A e is powerful, but humans add
judgment Together, they create the

258
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:38,944
right mix of efficiency and trust.

259
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:39,564
I,

260
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,564
how do we bring everything together?

261
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,844
The answer is through a clear roadmap.

262
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:48,604
Step One Foundation between
three to six months.

263
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:55,264
In this stage, organization set up
ML ops, infrastructure, governance

264
00:16:55,384 --> 00:17:00,484
frameworks, steaming capabilities,
and an initial catalog of models.

265
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:04,715
Step two, integration anywhere
between six to 12 months.

266
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,475
Here, models connect to real systems.

267
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,150
Low risk decision can be automated.

268
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,920
Monitoring is deployed and
retaining pipelines are built.

269
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,920
Step three expenses, 12 to 24 months
at this age organization adopt advanced

270
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,230
methods like reinforcement learning
or natural language interfaces.

271
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,120
Yay.

272
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,650
A capabilities expand across departments
and scale across the enterprise.

273
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,345
The key is not to rush.

274
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:39,304
Organizations succeed by starting
small, proving value in yearly use

275
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:42,514
cases, then expanding step by step.

276
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:43,225
Yeah.

277
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:48,235
Roadmap, provide direction, ensures steady
progress and builds trust in the system.

278
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,649
So how does this work
move the field forward?

279
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,620
First, we are building unified.

280
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,249
Cloud native YAML ops platforms.

281
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,779
Instead of scattered tools,
models and workflows run on

282
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,070
scalable and cloud systems that
connect across the enterprise.

283
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,540
Second, we enabled real time intelligence.

284
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,530
Instead of waiting for reports,
leaders get immediate insights

285
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,330
and prescriptive actions.

286
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,975
This level of responsiveness
was not possible in the past.

287
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:24,834
That we design, adoptive and resilient EA
systems, this system do not break easily.

288
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:29,534
When condition change, they
are self-optimizing, fault

289
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,124
tolerant, and reliable.

290
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:38,014
Finally, we embed ethical EA by
design, fairness, explainability and

291
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:42,114
complaints are built into the system
from the start together, these advances.

292
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:46,494
Change enterprise intelligence
from your reporting tool into your

293
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,684
real time trusted decision engine.

294
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,864
This is not just evaluation.

295
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:55,754
It is a step change that pushes
the entire field forward.

296
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:59,769
Let's look at the measurable research
organization have achieved with

297
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,654
AI driven enterprise intelligence.

298
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,519
First, forecasting accuracy.

299
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,219
BU by about 30 percentage.

300
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,909
This means companies predict, demand,
supply, or risk more effectively leading

301
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,249
to better planning and fewer surprises.

302
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:22,139
Second, reporting efficiency increased by
90 percentage reports that once took our

303
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,049
third days now generated almost instantly.

304
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,854
Leaders can access insights
quickly and make timely decisions.

305
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:35,054
That companies achieve total to 15
percentage revenue preservation by

306
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:40,965
predicting risk earlier and optimizing
operation, they avoided losses and capture

307
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,844
opportunities that might have been missed.

308
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:46,475
These numbers are not just statistics.

309
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:52,804
They represent real business outcomes,
better planning, faster decision,

310
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:54,935
and stronger financial performance.

311
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:59,915
They also prove that AI driven
intelligence is more than theory.

312
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,594
It delivers enterprise level
transformation in real environments

313
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:07,655
for Fortune 500 companies and beyond.

314
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,014
These impacts are clear evidence of value.

315
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,054
So what does it mean
for the wider industry?

316
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:15,034
It meets.

317
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:17,854
These models are not
just useful in one place.

318
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,254
They are shaping new standards.

319
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:24,205
These frameworks are now being
used as a reference architectures.

320
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:28,975
They are seated in case studies,
studied in professional forums, and

321
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,014
adapted by multiple organizations.

322
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:34,445
This will source their
reliability and broad relevance.

323
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:37,479
Many companies adopt the same approach.

324
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,459
It validates the model.

325
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:45,789
It proves that unifying Yay ops real time
data and governance works in practice.

326
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:52,080
This adoption also creates momentum as
more organizations follow these practices,

327
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:56,929
technology vendors and platform adopt
their tools to support them in the

328
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:02,264
innovation spreads becoming an industry
now rather than an isolated success.

329
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,455
This is a real power of this work.

330
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:07,055
It doesn't just transform one company.

331
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:11,535
It raises the bar for how
entire industry thinks about yay

332
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:13,015
driven enterprise intelligence.

333
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:13,635
I,

334
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:16,695
before we close, let us
review the key points.

335
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:18,245
First, yay.

336
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,575
Driven enterprise intelligence
transform decision making.

337
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:26,165
We move from backward looking
reports to real time predictive

338
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:27,815
and prescriptive systems.

339
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:30,415
Second, integration is essential.

340
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:36,385
The real value comes when organization
move beyond isolated pilots and adopt

341
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:38,870
unified frameworks across the enterprise.

342
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,795
That responsible, yay, responsible,
yay, is not just optional.

343
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:50,295
Ethics, governance and transparency
must build in from the beginning.

344
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,685
Test is the foundation for adoption.

345
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:58,975
Finally, ops maturity is the
enabler consistent practices for

346
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,895
model development deployment.

347
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:06,315
On monitoring 10 yaya from one time our
projects into sustainable capabilities.

348
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:10,675
