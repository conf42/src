1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey everyone, I'm Mudassir Sharif
and I am An AI engineer who has been

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,459
building and deploying AI systems in
production for a while now I feel like

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,719
right now like everyone is watching
towards like, building some kind of

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,649
AI system in production right now
and Then that is where like I've seen

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,529
different stakeholders ask a question.

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,749
Like how do we make sure that our
AI models are working As we want in

7
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:31,709
production like how do we make sure
that we get the maximum roi because

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,729
that only happens If your models or
your systems work as you want right

9
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,399
and not the other way around and that
is why this is really important talk.

10
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:47,740
I believe that like everyone, for
example, different stakeholders can be

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,420
executives who want to oversee the entire
AI stuff happening in their company.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,590
And also at the same time, engineering
managers who are overseeing different

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:07,470
LLM projects, like how can they think
about how to measure the models and

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,460
systems, I would say, in production.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,970
And And that is why, for example, in
this short talk, I will be covering all

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,020
the important, I would say, concepts
that the entire industry has been

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,959
using to monitor system and production.

18
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:29,705
And then from these concepts, we can think
about, for example, okay, so how do we

19
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:32,605
measure LLMs in production as well, right?

20
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:37,775
And then after we cover different
tools, different concepts, towards

21
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,565
the end, we'll sum things up as well.

22
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:47,295
So, the question is, what is model
monitoring on a really high level?

23
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,645
There are two main things,
there are two main goals.

24
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:54,165
The AI system, we, towards the
start when you are building a

25
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:59,655
use case, you define how you want
the entire AI system to behave.

26
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:04,865
And you define some key
KPIs that you want to track.

27
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:10,470
And then the goal is to simply see, is
the model able to meet the Or exceed

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,250
those kpis in productions or not, right?

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,520
one example can be let's say a bank,
every time like you go and swipe

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,490
your credit card there's a model
that the bank use behind the hood to

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:31,950
simply classify if the card was used
by someone who is Not you, right?

32
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,065
So they have like for them the bank
for them You They are monitoring

33
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:41,305
How well the system is able to tag?

34
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:46,805
fraudulent Transactions
versus the non fraudulent one.

35
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,195
That's one example.

36
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:54,965
So their kpi is the percentage of
fraudulent transactions they were unable

37
00:02:54,965 --> 00:03:01,505
to tag in production, right so for llm
for example, like Let's say you have an

38
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:07,460
llm system in place You Which is, which
you are right now using to automate.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,020
Questioning answering for example,
there is customer support Use case

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,850
or you have a vendor who's providing
you with an ai tool that is able to

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,299
automate the entire Customer support
tickets like how do we make sure?

42
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:29,209
like in that system is the model able
to provide accurate information Or lm

43
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,619
is giving the accurate information.

44
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:38,614
That is a really important kpi That you
want to track So the very important I

45
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:42,474
would say a really high level in summary
like you define what you want to track

46
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:49,255
number one and Then based on that you
define all the other sub I would say

47
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:54,795
KPIs you want to track So like before I
move forward like It's really important

48
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:59,745
to understand that Model tracking, if
you look at the last 10 years of the

49
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:04,765
history of what's been happening in the
industry There are two main things that

50
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:11,015
Everyone is tracking and it's worth
tracking Number one is for example what

51
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:19,915
goes inside the model and that is called
data And what comes out of the model that

52
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:25,770
is called some prediction or some token
If you think about the llm domain, so so

53
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,230
before before llms when we think about
Monitoring in machine learning use cases.

54
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,010
we track All the inputs it's called data
and then we track the output It's called

55
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,470
concept or prediction drift the same also
hap is happening right now in the llm

56
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,290
space as well So So, what, what do we do?

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,240
For example, okay.

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,230
So once we define and then we'll
talk about more in detail, how

59
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,210
do we define different KPIs?

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,330
what's the end goal here?

61
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,070
The end goal here is that, these,
some system has to be there to track

62
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,730
the model and then let us know when.

63
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,900
Okay.

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,790
There is something abnormal, right?

65
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,790
So we can go back and fix it, right?

66
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,660
So and then ideally in the ideal case
scenario, you want to have a system

67
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,580
in place that can Number one track and
at the same time trigger Some pipeline

68
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:29,245
which can go and fix the entire Model or
retrain it or simply if you are in the

69
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:34,985
llm domain improve the prompt So the goal
is to track and then in the end improve

70
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:42,805
systems in production And make sure the
output is how we want the output to be And

71
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:47,095
then there are different tools out there
to do that as well so if you think about

72
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:52,875
the llm domain right now, there is athena
that's doing a really good job there And

73
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:58,775
then at the same time there is lang smith
That is also a really good job right now

74
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:04,615
to provide you with the entire Monitoring
and how things are going in production

75
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:14,365
Let me quickly show you the entire
athena folks All right, so uh Moving

76
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,055
back towards what do we want to track?

77
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:21,255
So there are two once again, there
are two things we want to track

78
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:27,355
always you want to track What
data that goes inside the model?

79
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:31,034
And how is that data changing over time?

80
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:38,765
let's suppose like you have An llm system
in place for customer support And then

81
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:48,505
you have built that system to handle
Tickets regarding refund and change in

82
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:51,565
Delivery address for example, right?

83
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,415
That system is employed in the e
commerce domain and then you go you

84
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:03,185
only track these two things That's the
input refund requests and change in

85
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:10,275
the address requests So let's say like
You like in the production that for

86
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:17,165
example the tickets that are coming up
are not about refund or are not about

87
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:21,975
the change in the address the tickets
that are coming up about are about our

88
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:28,575
complaints about The performance or the
quality of a product means what there's

89
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:34,665
a drift Means what the input that the
system was receiving Was built to handle

90
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,705
You have a system in place to handle
refunds and then you handle I would say

91
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:44,065
Change in the address now you have some
different kind of inputs coming up, right?

92
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:52,425
So in that case We call this drift
And drift on the data level in that

93
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:56,525
case normally for example, like since
you What you never build a system in

94
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:02,575
place to handle those tickets regarding
faulty product Your system is going to

95
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:06,185
perform as Expected pretty much, right?

96
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,670
that is called a drift on the Data
level the other example that I can

97
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,220
think of right now is a bank Let's
say a bank has a system in place.

98
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,060
They have a model they have trained on
the customer data to tag transactions

99
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:30,320
as D as fraudulent or not Or yeah And
for example, and let's say that bank

100
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,020
is expanding in a new country, right?

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Of course when they expand a new country
and they open up their shops there

102
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,340
And then they are offering credit card
to different clients in that country.

103
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:49,360
Of course the data that will Be
coming into the ai model will be

104
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,880
different right because different
in the sense of Location and other

105
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,760
attributes right for sure, right?

106
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,640
So that is where we call this drift the
inputs that we are sending in the model

107
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:10,420
has changed Over time means what the
system that you had built before is no

108
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,390
longer Going to work in this case if
you have to go back and fix it, right

109
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,610
or you have to either You Find a way
to handle these new requests or you

110
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,070
have to build Or retrain the entire
ai system to make sure it handles

111
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,900
all the scenarios whenever there's
a drift in the data level Normally,

112
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,100
for example, like how do we do that?

113
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,210
we track distributions, so I do
have a few right now really good

114
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,710
examples to show as well On how
do we like easily measure drift?

115
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,010
It's normally distribution,
for example, right?

116
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,620
let's say the distribution on the
location level was only the US,

117
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,360
but now that a new bank has opened
up their shops in Europe, right?

118
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,910
So normally you will have a
different distribution coming up.

119
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,230
Simple as that.

120
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,690
So your input, again, the input,
it was red and sometimes blue, but

121
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,220
over time it's more, it's mainly,
I would say blue and less red.

122
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,450
Or for example, Before there was more
mainly Online transactions and now

123
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,840
there are more offline transactions.

124
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,030
I don't know maybe the covert is gone
now, for example, and that is an example

125
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,950
of a drift the data that's coming in
has changed over time because The world

126
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,420
you operate in has also changed over
time as well and then, for example,

127
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,800
if I think about the LLM domain right
now, we talked about, for example,

128
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,790
that the tickets that are coming
in, they are different tickets now.

129
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,200
Something has happened
in the system before.

130
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,810
So moving on, for example, the other
really important concept that we have to

131
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,800
track is the drift in the output.

132
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,320
And that is mainly called model
drift Why is that happening?

133
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,470
It's quite possible.

134
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,920
For example And the output drift happens
for two reasons number one is for example,

135
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,840
Like over time the input is different.

136
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,160
For example, it's quite possible.

137
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,990
The output is going to be
different for sure, right?

138
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,560
there's difference in the output
driven by the input number one and

139
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,735
number two is the concept drift that
happens because the model was built to

140
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:38,705
build to learn patterns in the data.

141
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:46,635
And that data represents a world right
now in 2025 it's quite possible that in

142
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,345
two, three years, how people buy stuff.

143
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,410
can change right, over time it's
quite possible that the relationship

144
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,600
between different variables in play
are different now and that is where

145
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,970
the models is not going to give you the
right output or prediction in that case.

146
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,420
to think about a few examples right
now towards concept drift let me

147
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,270
open up this link really quick.

148
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,320
Yep, I think that's a really
important example over here as well.

149
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,990
So sales like they were mainly online
sales and now there's offline sales.

150
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,310
And it's quite possible that,
yeah, one example can be, for

151
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,160
example, if you have a new store.

152
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,170
And then new store and then you see
that your sales is more seasonal, right?

153
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,065
But as the store and as your business
grows over time you have Like you

154
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:51,375
have a strong brand It's quite
possible that you are collaborating

155
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:53,335
with different influencers, right?

156
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:56,545
And then it's quite and then for
example, it's quite possible that

157
00:12:57,115 --> 00:13:03,765
at that time like your sales are
not entirely driven by Seasonality,

158
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:09,115
it's also driven by different events
happening or different campaigns you run.

159
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:14,275
So Your sales, your prediction is
no longer, I would say, dependent

160
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,525
on seasonality or something else.

161
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:21,015
It's a different business or
different concepts in play.

162
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,995
That's the other example of,
for example, concept drift.

163
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:28,685
The model was, once
again, it's really short.

164
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:33,425
The model was trained to learn a
phenomena and that phenomena has changed.

165
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:38,595
because the world has changed and that
is where you can see I expect to see a

166
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:46,855
model Going wrong or not giving you the
right output So like Simply for example

167
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:53,705
if you are tracking drift on two levels
There's input and the output or data

168
00:13:54,125 --> 00:14:00,305
and the model Then the alerts are Also
going to be on these two level, right?

169
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:05,475
for example Okay, so sometimes for
example, it's quite possible that we

170
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,945
like hey, it's okay Like it's okay.

171
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:12,755
For example, if there's a drift in the
input But as long as there is no drift

172
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,665
in the output, we are fine, right?

173
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,795
And that depends on the use case.

174
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:22,145
It's quite possible, for example,
that LLMs were not given instructions

175
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,885
on how to handle requests.

176
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,560
requests that are coming in about
some faulty products, right?

177
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,770
But that LLM focus for support is smart
enough to handle these new requests

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,980
because these models are really
good at understanding the language.

179
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,620
In that case, like you might say, Hey, the
input difference is not really important.

180
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,780
The output difference is really important.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,765
For example, if you see models Giving the
output that is not backed by citations

182
00:14:55,765 --> 00:15:01,375
or giving the output that is, that
contradicts what we have in data, or

183
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:06,695
there is some hallucination, for example,
different metrics we track in the output.

184
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:10,995
That is where, that is the
most important thing to track.

185
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,855
And then for example, like in the
other case scenario, for example,

186
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:20,815
uh, in finance or in healthcare, they
might want to, for example, track both

187
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:26,125
the inputs and both the output means
they want to track all the drift in

188
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:29,185
every variable, the input in model.

189
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:35,085
And they also want to track the drift
in all the output or as well, right?

190
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:40,225
and then for example,
like how much drift is.

191
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:46,255
I would say is something that you can
accept but also it depends on the use

192
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:53,515
case for example, if there's a model that
i've trained to predict Sales, right?

193
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:59,075
And then I see that there's a drift
or of around 10 percent It's quite

194
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:02,565
possible that my demand forecasting
or sales forecasting model.

195
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:08,645
I already have that like At
a threshold in place or I've

196
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:15,255
already stocked, my inventory 10
percent more than the prediction.

197
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,295
So that small amount of drift
won't be super important.

198
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:23,450
But on the other hand, for example, A
bank for a bank or for a health case

199
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,930
Use case even a one person drift for
them would be super important, right?

200
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,610
So that threshold Is something for
example that has to be defined by the

201
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,900
company So if you just think about the
llm cases right now because that is where

202
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,500
Majority of the work is happening right
now You As well, so on the input side

203
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,920
the most important thing for example
for them is a The number of input tokens

204
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,180
is fairly important On the input level
for example, i've seen companies also

205
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,770
track as well the Sentiment as well.

206
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,930
For example, let's suppose if sent if
sentiment of the tickets you are receiving

207
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:15,200
in your customer support llm agent Has
changed over time a lot Then it's quite

208
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,930
possible that you might there's something
wrong happening or there's some change

209
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:27,040
in the overall system or Overall, I
would say world and then it's worth

210
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,250
going back to Think if we have to go and
change our Prompt or change something

211
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,480
else and then like on the output level,
for example, there is hallucination that

212
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,725
even on track as well there is number of
output tokens for example, let's say like

213
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:53,005
before you saw that the model is Always
giving you like 500 tokens on average

214
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:58,765
in every output But now all of a sudden
the models are giving you 1000 tokens

215
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:04,555
For example, like that's something you
wanna go and understand or like why is

216
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:11,200
the output number of tokens Different
it's quite possible that You There's

217
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,120
a drift on the concept level, right?

218
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,780
for example the phenomena that you want to
track And you want your models to handle

219
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,020
that phenomena is it's very different
now Because the these maybe like the

220
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:30,270
store has grown The tickets that are
coming in Are not only around refunds.

221
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,920
There are more tickets about some
other queries coming in and then

222
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,170
the two really important tools that
I've seen right now, in action, I

223
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,990
use like Athena in my companies just
because like they have a really easy

224
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,880
to build our assessment in place.

225
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,430
but at the same time, like I've also
seen Langsmith people being used a lot.

226
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,380
These both of these tools have one
really important thing they track every

227
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,270
inference of every prediction So you see
for example, okay, so what's happening

228
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,150
and then for example, you also have the
ability to simply track the change in

229
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,640
tokens Change and then you can also build
your own tracking evaluations or KPI

230
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,410
so track for example on hallucinations,
and then you also have ability to track

231
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,370
different various aspects Both on the
inputs and both on the outputs level

232
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,840
Yeah, I think we cover that as
well so and then for example like

233
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,640
different tools if you think about
where If you have a different Machine

234
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,600
learning system in place that I've
seen Evidently ai being used a lot.

235
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,530
It's an open source tool used By a
lot of people in the industry and

236
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,960
then they have both Different kpis
being built on the input and output

237
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,510
level And then you have the ability to
simply think about which kpis or which

238
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,320
metrics you want to monitor as well

239
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,840
I think we covered different examples
before, so towards the end, on a really

240
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,690
high level, for example, we never
went into detail on different, on, on

241
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,230
math behind different concepts, for
example, like how do we measure drift?

242
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,730
Okay, so if drift is on the
distribution level, for example, what

243
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,780
are different formulas or concepts
that are in place to measure drift?

244
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,125
The difference in distribution.

245
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,215
That's a different topic, right?

246
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:33,825
So but like in this shot
I Would say presentation.

247
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:40,715
My goal was to simply explain that
Monitoring is happening or has been

248
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:42,455
happening on two different levels.

249
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:48,055
There's either Input that goes in the
model and then there is the output The

250
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:53,685
input is called and then the change in
the input is called data drift and then

251
00:20:53,685 --> 00:21:00,025
the change in the output is called model
drift and then Within these two buckets.

252
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:05,925
There are different Kpi as you can
think about if you have a traditional

253
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:12,555
machine learning system in players,
then it's simply just different

254
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:17,325
distribution For example, it's quite
possible that you have one very input

255
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:23,235
variable location before Location was
only different cities in the u. s.

256
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:30,115
But now you have location as different
cities in the US plus in Europe plus in

257
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,105
Asia means what the input has changed.

258
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:38,095
If the input that goes in the model is
different, the output will be different.

259
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:43,860
For example, number two, the output,
for example, before Model was giving

260
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,440
a prediction Always more than 50, but
now you see model giving prediction

261
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,920
Between the range of 30 and 60.

262
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,940
There is a difference In the prediction
or on the output of the model and that in

263
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,680
that means there's a drift in the output.

264
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,285
So That means something and these are
two different buckets that you always

265
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:10,965
have to track and then How much drift
can you afford it all depends on?

266
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:17,725
The use case in healthcare or in finance
where you have regulations in place.

267
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:24,490
It's and, how much drift can you
afford depends on the regulations

268
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:32,149
and depends, depends on, the loss the
company can incur because of that drift.

269
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,090
In some use cases, like you always
have an error built into prediction.

270
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,000
For example, retail, they always know,
okay, so they are, if they are doing

271
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,550
demand forecasting, they always like.

272
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:53,025
Overstock because like it's fine to
have an extra stock versus having less

273
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:59,155
stock because There's more loss to the
company if customer works in the store

274
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:05,175
and goes out without buying stuff So they
always overstock so for them They can

275
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:11,375
afford to have a big drift if there's
a big surge or big drop in the demand

276
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:17,230
They're always prepared right but on
the other hand, for example, like For

277
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:24,660
them if their prediction is like they
will sell 100 1 million skews SKUs They

278
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,870
won't be stalking 5 million, right?

279
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,009
They will always be stalking 1.

280
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:29,720
2 million, right?

281
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,160
So for them they need accurate prediction,
but in the end They are fine if their

282
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,670
models Have a really big drift in the
output because of different reasons in

283
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,340
place So this is On a really high level.

284
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,280
For example, how do we monitor
our AI systems in production

285
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,170
and how do we make sure that?

286
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,140
Our models behave as we want and
we get the maximum ROI because

287
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,040
as a result Signing off now
