00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,410
Welcome to this presentation on Identity
Federation, a groundbreaking approach to

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,450
industry wide digital identity management.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,570
We will explore how this innovative
concept can streamline user

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,379
experiences, enhance security,
and improve productivity.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,030
and drive significant cost savings
across various sectors, including IOT.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,420
So first of all, what is the, why there
is a need for identity federation?

7
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,770
First one is a password fatigue.

8
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:37,149
Users manage an average of hundred
passwords leading to an unsafe

9
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,189
practices, including reusing the
same password, less secure passwords.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,839
And the next one is
security vulnerability.

11
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:51,440
61 percent of data breaches
involve credentials, which 85

12
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,079
percent involving human elements.

13
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,099
Next is a poor user experience.

14
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,764
55 percent of consumers
abandon their devices.

15
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:08,075
Online purchases due to password issues
and last there is an inefficient in

16
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:14,335
Onboarding repeated identity verification
leads to increased costs for service

17
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:20,325
providers So this is where I am proposing
the identity federation model where

18
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:26,765
you will utilize a single sign on
with a seamless access across multiple

19
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:29,540
providers So this includes four steps.

20
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,980
The first one is establishing the
single sign on and then standardizing

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,089
the identity attributes, for example,
industry specific verified information.

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,760
and then consent management where
user gives control over data sharing

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,920
and consent to usage of that.

24
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:54,835
Next will be industry specific trust
framework, where we define rules

25
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,185
and standards for participation.

26
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:01,345
So looking at the technical
implementation, we need

27
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:04,340
to first extend OAuth 2.

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,875
0 scopes and define industry specific
scopes for fine grained access control.

29
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,765
Then we need to federate the
identity providers, institutions.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:22,970
Act as both idp and sp for cross
provider authentication Next is

31
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,840
an attribute exchange protocol.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,370
So In this we will have a way to
securely share user attributes between

33
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,550
federated members And last but not
least we need to have a federation

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,510
registry A centralized place where
the registration for participating

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,170
institutions And metadata are maintained.

36
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,540
So where can we see these applications?

37
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,810
First one is banking sector
applications So implementing this

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,990
concept of identity federation, it
simplifies the account opening process.

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,870
It reduced onboarding time by 80
percent, saving up to 1 billion

40
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,720
annually for large banks, and then
a seamless service integration.

41
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:16,875
increase of cross selling opportunities
by 30 percent and improve the

42
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:19,875
customer retention by 25 percent.

43
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:23,185
This also enhances the fraud detection.

44
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:28,125
This reduces the identity fraud by
up to 90 percent saving the industry

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,945
an estimated 7 billion annually.

46
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,355
And then we can also look into the
same thing where we can apply this

47
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,745
for a healthcare sector applications.

48
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:42,705
So we can For example, streamlining
patient access records, interoperable

49
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:45,835
health IT systems could save the U.

50
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:45,995
S.

51
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:49,615
healthcare system by 30 billion a year.

52
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:54,445
And then we can also look into,
in the healthcare sector, we can

53
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,065
improve the care coordination.

54
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:03,175
so especially when, a patient visits
multiple different facilities or

55
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:07,975
healthcare providers, They can
basically, coordinate better through

56
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:12,455
the shared health information that
can reduce the hospital readmissions

57
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:19,115
by 20 percent by reusing existing
intakes and verified user information.

58
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,635
This also reduces the
administrative overhead.

59
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:27,755
Which can save up to 30 minutes per
patient encounter by eliminating redundant

60
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:33,795
data entry identity verification process
Because a user is already presented and

61
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:38,685
they have their own identify identity
federated Where data gets shared?

62
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:45,315
across all the healthcare sector And then
we can also do the same thing in education

63
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:50,665
sector, where portable of academic
credentials, especially, transcript

64
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:56,365
verification time can go by 90 percent
saving institutions, an average of 150%.

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Dollars per student application Which
they actually have to pay to get the

66
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,850
transcripts verified and then there is a
simplified enrollment process basically

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,700
because we are federating the user it
increases the adult learner enrollment

68
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,730
by 25 percent by removing barriers to
entry And simplifying credit transfer

69
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,890
process And then come the secure
credential sharing, this reduce hiring

70
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,220
times by 40 percent and improve job
matching accuracy by 30 percent through

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,800
a secure sharing of transcripts and
certifications with potential employers.

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,010
So looking at the economic impact
of Identity Federation, this could

73
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,010
increase the GDP growth, by 2013
countries that implement this digital

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,870
ID systems by around three to 13%.

75
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,180
As I was mentioning earlier,
healthcare savings with an annual

76
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,190
savings for interoperable health IT
systems can save up to 30 billion.

77
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:02,600
So it reduces the onboarding, potential
risk reduction in onboarding costs for

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,160
financial institutions by approximately
90 percent of their costs that were

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,160
involved in onboarding a new customer.

80
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,310
Then come the financial inclusion,
because number of unbanked

81
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,780
financial services can use up to 1.

82
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,720
7 billion dollars.

83
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,680
So what are the challenges
and considerations?

84
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,690
So the regulatory compliance
is one of the biggest thing.

85
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,300
So implementations must comply
with industry specific regulations

86
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,840
and data protection laws.

87
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,210
the GDPR finds total 1.

88
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,770
3 billion euros in 2021, a sevenfold
increase from the previous year.

89
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,830
And then the security itself, 45 percent
of the organizations reported an increase

90
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,100
in cyber attacks in the past 12 months.

91
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,260
Robot security measures, including
multi factor authentication and advanced

92
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,760
threat detections are very essential.

93
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,680
Then comes privacy.

94
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,260
43 percent of the respondents were
very or extremely concerned about

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,980
the security and privacy issues.

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,090
So user centric privacy controls
are crucial for building trust

97
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,890
and encouraging the adoption.

98
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,720
So this is where a standardized,
industry specific IOT standards

99
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,020
needs to be introduced.

100
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,220
and these challenges can slowly
be addressed with working

101
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,800
with respective agencies.

102
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,620
And so what is the, so if you look
at the addressing, the primary

103
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,980
implementation challenge, The first one
is a regulatory Alignment, so we have

104
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,220
to develop frameworks that inherently
align with the key regulations that

105
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,550
This could be a country specific
or a global regulation That various

106
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:52,660
countries can come because IOTs Get
access across the internet so this would

107
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,020
be very advantage if the regulatory
alignment happens at a global level.

108
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,260
then we have to look into
enhanced security measures.

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,870
We have to implement advanced protocol
like biometric authentication or various

110
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,210
other type of secure, authentication
measures like two factor authentications.

111
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,750
Then we have to think in the
terms of privacy by design.

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,220
So incorporating privacy enhancing
technologies and granular consent

113
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,520
mechanisms should be allowed.

114
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,930
For example, if you want to allow
permissions only at very certain

115
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,060
specific conditions, so that is where
the granularity comes into picture.

116
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,100
And then the industry collaborations is
very important because we are looking

117
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,170
at an industry specific alignment.

118
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,000
So fostering past partnerships to
develop these interoperable standards

119
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,240
involving various parties in the
same industry in defining those

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,270
interoperable standards is very crucial.

121
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,810
Then education and awareness.

122
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,590
is also equally important because,
we need to launch new initiatives

123
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,530
to educate organizations and users,
to, try and adapt these industry

124
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,310
specific standards so that they become
interoperable and they get access to the

125
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,240
larger, Market across various systems.

126
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,010
So in conclusion, the future of digital
identity is definitely very good.

127
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,950
Identity Federation represents a
transformative approach to digital

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,590
identity management, poised to
revolutionize how organizations and

129
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:35,130
consumers interact across various sectors
by addressing issues such as Critical

130
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,920
challenges in identity management
and leveraging existing standards.

131
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,260
It has the potential to create
more efficient, secure, and user

132
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,060
friendly digital ecosystems.

133
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,260
As industries continue to digitalize
and integrate, Identity Federation

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,690
standards ready to unlock substantial
economic value, improve user

135
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,365
experience, and pave the way for more
integrated and user centric digital

136
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,205
services across entire sectors.

137
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,325
Thank you.
