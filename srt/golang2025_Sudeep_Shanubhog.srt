00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,020
Good everyone.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,980
This is Sui.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,770
It's a pleasure to be here today to
talk about AI Power Cloud security

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:12,760
for Comm 42 and how Golang based
solutions are transforming security

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,510
for Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.

6
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:16,790
What is Golan?

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,550
Colan is an open source programming
language developed by Google in 2 0 9.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,310
It is designed to be fast, efficient,
and scalable, making it ideal

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,209
for cloud computing, networking,
and realtime applications.

10
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:36,610
Some of the key features of Golang
Fast performance, it compiles directly

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,300
to machine code, making it faster
the interpreted language like Python,

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,169
optimized for low latency applications.

13
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:50,350
Example, realtime security merchant
and support uses geo routings to

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,180
handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,070
Perfect for throughout
applications like AI powered threat

16
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,130
detection, and it has a memory.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,330
Efficience includes automatic garbage
collection for optimized memory use,

18
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,160
helps to process large amounts of
security data without performance issues.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,870
The cloud security challenge.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,435
As business continue to adopt
cloud computing, security remains

21
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:14,510
one of the biggest challenge.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,740
The expanding attack surface means,
traditional security to struggle to

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,510
keep up with the real-time threats.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,580
Attackers are getting more sophisticated
and the operational cost of

25
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,920
security incidents is skyrocketing.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,880
This is why we need intelligent adapt
to security frameworks such as AI driven

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,130
solutions to respond instantaneously
and in mitigate risk efficiently.

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,920
Data driven security improvements.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:48,790
AI powered security isn't just concept,
it's delivering real results, like

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,170
64% increase in the threat detection
accuracy, 57% reduction in response

31
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,185
time, 43% lower operational cost.

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:07,200
And 18.5 million security when sponsors
by leveraging AI security teams can detect

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,050
threats faster, respond proactivity, and
reduce manual workload while cutting the

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,640
cost advanced persistent threat, which
is called a PT detection, signature

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,685
based detection method phase to identify
advanced persistent threats because they

36
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:25,685
evolve beyond known attack patterns.

37
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:29,755
Traditional security solution rely
on static rules, which struggle to

38
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,825
keep up with sophisticated attacks.

39
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:36,435
Our Golan AI solution, however,
uses machine learning to identify

40
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:40,035
APTs with 96.42% accuracy.

41
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,485
It continuously adopts to emerging threats
and using behavioral analysis to detect

42
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:51,125
suspicious patterns in milliseconds,
allowing instant containment.

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,840
No attack pattern detection.

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,570
Security threats are always evolving.

45
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,640
Our AI driven security solution
continuously learns and adapt to

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,500
detect new attack vectors through
24 bar zone monitoring across

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,900
all Azure resources, pattern
recognition that detects anomalies.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,810
Automated response that deploys
countermeasures in milliseconds

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,460
self-learning algorithm that
improve at every security event.

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,370
This is real time adaptability.

51
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,125
Ensure that even never before
seen threats are detected and

52
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,805
neutralized interest initially.

53
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,720
Performance at scale Secure solution
must be fast, scalable, and efficient.

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,570
Our goal and based security framework
process 12,000 security requests

55
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,300
per second real time parallel threat
analysis using Golan concurrency

56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,470
model distributed architecture
across multiple Azure regions.

57
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,600
For zero downtime production, this
ensures lightning fast threat detection

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,430
without impacting system performance.

59
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,769
You are under heavy workloads.

60
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,620
Implementation architecture.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,450
Here is how we process
security data in real time.

62
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,150
First one is data collection.

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,650
We ingest Azure logs telemetry
and user active data.

64
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,560
Second, we pre-process, we
enriched the data using threat

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,150
intelligence and parallel processing.

66
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,750
In Golan third process machine learning
analysis, we apply AI models like

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,050
generative models with 90%, 96% accuracy
to detect analysis and declassify threat

68
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,465
For process response orchestration,
we automate third containment within

69
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,865
milliseconds, ensuring minimal disruption.

70
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:41,995
Quantum security feature security threats
are evolving and quantum computing will

71
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,215
bring both challenges and opportunities.

72
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:49,015
Our next generation AI security
solutions are integrating like

73
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,655
quantum enhanced pattern recognition.

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,780
Which improves attack
detection by 47 percentage.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,530
Second is predictive threat analytics.

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,860
Forecasting attacks with 63% more
accuracy and quantum resistance

77
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,570
cryptography, ensuring encryption remains
secure against future quantum attacks.

78
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,880
By adopting quantum driven AI
security, we are preparing for

79
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,830
the next era of cybersecurity.

80
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,330
