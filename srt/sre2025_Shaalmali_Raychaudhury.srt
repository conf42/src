1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,900
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,740
Today I am really excited to talk
about a critical aspect of ID

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,600
operations that ensures the stability
and reliability of our systems site

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,280
reliability, engineering, or SRE as
you may know, and incident management.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,830
These processes are the backbone of
any organizations' ability to deliver

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,245
seamless services to its users while
maintaining operational efficiency.

7
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:29,895
In this session we'll explore three
connected processes, incident management,

8
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:35,055
problem management, and change management,
and how they work together to minimize

9
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:40,875
disruptions, resolve issues efficiently,
and ensure long-term system stability.

10
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,855
So with this, let's begin by diving
into incident management, which

11
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:49,875
is the first line of defense in
handling it Service disruptions.

12
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,664
So let's talk about navigating
incident management.

13
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:59,845
Incident management is the process of
identifying, managing, and resolving ID

14
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:05,035
service disruptions to restore normal
operations as quickly as possible.

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:11,460
Think of it as the emergence response
team for your IT infrastructure, but

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,700
let's not confuse incidents with requests.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,730
Sometimes users or requesters will lose
access to certain tools and will be

18
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,050
unable to perform certain operations
and create an incident ticket.

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,570
But just to keep something in mind
that those should be logged as request

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,630
tickets and not an incident ticket.

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,109
So that would be a huge difference
between incident tickets and

22
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,479
our ITMs or request tickets.

23
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,889
So the key objectives of
incident management, first, it

24
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:50,359
aims to minimize the impact of
incidents on business operations.

25
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:55,100
Every minute of downtime can have
significant consequences like lost

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,229
revenue, frustrated customers, and
damage to the brand reputation,

27
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,820
which is sensitive, right?

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,960
Second, it ensures incidents
are resolved within the agreed

29
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,110
SLA or service level agreements.

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,240
So what is SLA?

31
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,200
SLAs?

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,960
Define the acceptable timeframes for
resolving issues, ensuring accountability

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,750
and consistency in service delivery.

34
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,150
And why is this important?

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,280
A structured incident management
process not only reduces downtime.

36
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:35,875
But also maintaining, maintain
service quality by ensuring issues are

37
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,515
handled efficiently and effectively.

38
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:41,654
Let me illustrate this with an example.

39
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:46,244
Imagine a critical e-commerce
platform that goes down during a

40
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:48,704
major sales event like Black Friday.

41
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:54,309
Without a robust incident management
process in place, it'll be utter chaos.

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,880
Teams will scramble without clear
roles or priorities prolonging the

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,150
outage, but with a structured approach.

44
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,790
The incident is S logged, the categorized
escalated, and the issue resolved

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,959
swiftly minimizing disruption with this.

46
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,329
Let's move on to another topic,
which is very much intertwined

47
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,130
with incident management, which is.

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,829
Problem management.

49
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,190
So while incident management focuses
on immediate resolution, problem

50
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,500
management takes a step back to address
the root causes of this incidents.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,975
Its goal is to prevent recurring
issues by identifying and

52
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,805
resolving systemic problems.

53
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:43,595
Some of the key activities, or I would say
the key activities in problem management

54
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:50,345
is root cause analysis or RCA, which
involves investigating underlying issues

55
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:56,675
to understand why an incident occurred
in the first place and implementing

56
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:01,535
permanent fixes are workarounds, so
once the root cause is identified,

57
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:06,845
teams work on permanent resolutions or
interim fixes to prevent recurrence.

58
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:12,214
Now you might wonder, how does problem
management relate to incident management?

59
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:15,305
The two processes are closely interwind.

60
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:20,815
Problem management uses data from
incidents, patterns, trends, and

61
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:26,935
recurring issues to identify, sorry,
systemic problems that need addressing.

62
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:32,000
For example imagine
repeated server outages.

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,020
Traced back to a
misconfigured application.

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,580
While incident management
resolves each outage temporarily.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,600
Problem management steps in to
permanently fix the configuration

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,580
issue by addressing these root causes,
problem management ensures long-term

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,375
stability and reduces the likelihood.

68
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:54,185
Of future disruptions now.

69
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:54,965
Isn't that great?

70
00:04:55,465 --> 00:05:02,760
So let's move forward to discussing our
third topic, which is change management.

71
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,130
So this third pillar we'll discuss
today is change management, which

72
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,970
focuses on planning, approving
and implementing changes.

73
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,600
To ID systems while minimizing risks
changes could include anything from

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,780
software updates to infrastructure
upgrades or new feature deployments.

75
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,370
Changes often arise as solutions
from problem management.

76
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,560
For instance, if problem management
identifies outdated software

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,330
as the root cause of recurring
issues, change management insurers.

78
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,655
That updates are deployed safely
without introducing new problems.

79
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:48,475
The key principles of change
management are risk assessment, which

80
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,825
is before implementing any change
is crucial to evaluate potential

81
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,615
risks and their impact on operations.

82
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,325
It did, it should not take down an entire
development or production environment.

83
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,750
Just saying testing and phase development
would be the second point of it.

84
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,430
As a key principle, changes should
be tested rigorously in control

85
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,170
environments before being rolled out
in phases to minimize disruptions.

86
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,720
An example would be, suppose
your team identifies recurring

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,070
performance issues with the database
system during problem management.

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Change management would oversee a
phased upgrade of that database system,

89
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,150
testing it thoroughly before rolling it
out across all environments to ensure

90
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,690
minimal risk of downtime or new issues.

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,770
By integrating change management with
incident and problem management processes,

92
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,830
organizations can implement fixes safely
while maintaining system reliability.

93
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,010
So before we wrap this up, let's
take a moment to reflect on how these

94
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,990
three processes, incident management,
problem management, and change

95
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,840
management work together seamlessly.

96
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,055
As we know, incident management
addresses immediate disruptions

97
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,915
to restorative services quickly.

98
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:13,505
And problem management
investigates the root causes to

99
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,605
prevent these recurring issues.

100
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:20,705
And change management ensures that
fixes or implements are implemented

101
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,765
safely without introducing new risks.

102
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:29,315
These interconnected processes form
the foundation of it, stability

103
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,295
and operational efficiency.

104
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,625
So let's discuss some.

105
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:39,550
Quick tips for effective incident
management to standardize incident

106
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,710
logging, categorization, and
prioritization processes so teams can

107
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,440
respond consistently and effectively.

108
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:52,660
For example, a P one or priority
one incident to one team member

109
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,710
should not be a P three or
priority three incident to another.

110
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,810
The second point is to use
automation tools for communication

111
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,460
and escalation to ensure.

112
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,990
Service level agreements or
SLAs are met without delays.

113
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,080
Sometimes sending out manual comms can
interfere with timelines for sending out

114
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,200
comms during an incident bridge, so it's
best to have comms automated as per need.

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,580
The third point would be regularly review
SLAs and priority metricses to ensure

116
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,100
alignment with evolving business needs.

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Also to note to keep track and follow up
on root cause or SLAs that are assigned

118
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,720
to respective teams so that those
deadlines are not missed out as well.

119
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,520
To conclude this section, our
final thought that I would like

120
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,990
to share is a well integrated
approach to incident management.

121
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,380
Problem management and change
management is essential for any

122
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,540
organization aiming to enhance.

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,720
Operational efficiency
while reducing downtime.

124
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,750
By focusing on these processes as part
of site reliability, engineering hacks,

125
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,550
we can ensure business continuity and
deliver exceptional service quality

126
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,950
even in the face of challenges.

127
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,510
So while wrapping this up, let's
discuss some tips and tricks for dealing

128
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,000
with difficult in incident bridges.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,820
And I promise you, you will definitely
come across at least one in your lifetime

130
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,880
if you are if you start working as SRE
incident manager, or if you're already

131
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
working as SRE or an incident manager.

132
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,945
So whenever we are on an incident
bridge, it is very important to

133
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,435
understand the impact of the incident.

134
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,605
Most times, users or requesters
will incline on driving their

135
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,915
issue as P one, not priority one.

136
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,075
However, if the impact does not align with
our priority metrics, it's best to convey

137
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:58,045
the user on why it stands out as a lesser
priority incident rather than only being

138
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:00,895
aggressive about switching the priority.

139
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:05,655
The second point that I would like to
bring up is oftentimes while dealing

140
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,415
with bridges, we tend to lack empathy.

141
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:13,305
Sometimes even when we are unable to
assist the user due to low priority

142
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:18,795
incidents or incidents not being in
our domain, it's best to guide the

143
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:23,115
user are requested with next steps
if we are aware of any, instead

144
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:24,705
of just leaving them straight.

145
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,285
And the third one.

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,270
And one of the most important points
is to maintain boundaries over bridges.

147
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,040
Sometimes we'll get a pushback on
following our standardized priority

148
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,620
metrics and escalation procedures.

149
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,600
It is important to be assertive when
needed to prevent unnecessary use of

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,150
our resources and time and invest those
where there is an actual need of them.

151
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,610
So it's very important
to keep that in mind.

152
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,830
So moving.

153
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:03,290
But moving to my last slide and the final
topic for discussion is something fun.

154
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,170
It's actually interview hacks for SI
or Im, or it's a general hack, I would

155
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,630
say that I have experienced and I
wanted to share that with whoever is.

156
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,240
Struggling or looking for some
tip centric for interviewing.

157
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,270
So oftentimes, I come across
fresh graduates asking if it's

158
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,770
okay to ask questions back to the
recruiter when they're reached

159
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,520
out for a call or interview.

160
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,010
I would recommend asking as many questions
as you need until you have a clear

161
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,020
idea on what you are signing up for.

162
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,240
It will not only help you to do
better in the interview, but also

163
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,500
will help you to understand if you
really want to move forward with the

164
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,570
opportunity, which is very important.

165
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,330
The second point to discuss is that
know your audience, which means

166
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,400
know your interviewers if possible,
research on how they interview and

167
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,650
what their skill sets are in the job.

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,750
Which might give you some understanding
on what to expect during your interview.

169
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,720
The third point that I would like to
discuss is enhancing your skillset,

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,000
the smart way for interviews.

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,010
Focus on short and fast courses on the
skillset requirements for the job that you

172
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,110
are interested in, rather than going for
a whole week's tutorial that will help to

173
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,570
build your confidence for the interview.

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,350
And most importantly, be confident.

175
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,880
Do not hesitate to share that you do
not know the answers to something,

176
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,840
share how much or how little so with
this, I wrap up this presentation

177
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,910
and I hope this was helpful.

178
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,620
So thank you for your time today.

179
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,090
I look forward to hearing your thoughts
or answering any questions that you

180
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,340
may have about this vital processes.

181
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,280
Say hi to me on LinkedIn.

182
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,060
