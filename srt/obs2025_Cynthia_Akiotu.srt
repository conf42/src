1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,180
Observability  without  identity  is
like  using  maps  without  landmarks.

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:12,719
No  matter  how  detailed  you  are,  you
can  never  get  to  where  you  are.

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,160
My  name  is  Cynthia  Akiotu,
a  cyber  security  analyst,  and

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,940
I'm  happy  here  today  to  be
here  today  presenting  this.

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,320
Intriguing  topic.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,100
Access  is  the  new  bridge.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,739
Why  observability  must
start  with  identity?

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,080
I  would  like  to  ask  this  question.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,620
When  last  did  you  conduct  access
reviews  in  your  organization?

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
Or  how  often  do  you  conduct
access  reviews  in  your  organization?

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,600
Is  it  automated?

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,780
Is  it  manual?

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,160
Or  you  don't  even  conduct  actor?

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,440
I  would  like  to  tell  you  to
try  and  conduct  access  reviews

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,300
and  you  might  just  be  surprised
in  what  you  will  find  in  your

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,900
system  or  within  your  environment.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,900
The

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
blind  spot  in  today's  observability.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,120
Most  tools,  or  most  tools,
observability  tools  we  use  in

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:21,300
our  organizations  are  good  at
checking  logs,  metrics,  traces,

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,900
like  your  downtime  in  the  system,
or  the  spike,  there's  a  spike  in

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,800
your  system,  checking  the  system
health,  checking  the  server  health,

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,160
but  there's  a  missing  link.

24
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:46,675
Can  these  observability  tools  or
these  logs  also  show  who  did  what?

25
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:52,315
Was  this  downtime  as  a  result  of
the  activity  of  a  particular  user?

26
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:57,675
Was  the,  these  spikes  in  our  API,
was  there  as  a  result  of  elevated

27
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:01,615
permissions  or  misuse  privileged?

28
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:05,175
So,  this  is  the  blind  spots.

29
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:12,245
in  today's  observability,  most
observability  tools,  we  are  seeing

30
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:17,165
these  beautiful  logs,  these  metrics,
these  dashboards,  but  there's

31
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:21,305
no  identity  contest,  there's  no
synergy  between  the  traditional

32
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:25,805
observability  tools  and  our  identity
and  assets  management  tools.

33
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:32,665
And  this  creates  a  big
vacuum  in  organizations,  Those

34
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,885
days  we  invest  so  much  on  firewalls.

35
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,970
Permeter  security.

36
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,149
But  now,  identity  is  the  gateway
and  the  entry  to  our  resources.

37
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,839
This  brings  me  now  to  this.

38
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:50,599
Identity  is  the  new  perimeter.

39
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,259
Identity  is  the  real  attack  surface.

40
00:02:54,259 --> 00:03:03,229
Identities  was  attributed  to
just  humans  or  human  users.

41
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,969
Now  we  have  managed  identities,
we  have  service  principles,

42
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,329
we  have  bots  in  our  system
acting  on  behalf  of  users.

43
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,009
With  the  complex  nature  of  our
technology  landscape  and  the  advent

44
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:24,309
of  artificial  intelligence,  we've  seen
lots  of  things,  heard  lots  of  things

45
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:29,164
like  AI,  Agents  working  in  our
systems,  bots  working  in  our  systems

46
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,884
and  all  these  now  have  identities.

47
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:37,225
Hackers  no  longer
put,  initiate  malwares.

48
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:42,285
They  are  logging  in  and  moving,
they  log  in  secretly  and  move

49
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:47,964
laterally  within  our  networks,  our
perimeters  without  getting  unnoticed.

50
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:56,040
About  80  percent  of  breaches
now  are  all  related  to  identity.

51
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,960
We  have  the  most  common
identity -related  breaches.

52
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,799
We  have  insider  threats.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,739
As  they  always  say,  we  are
as  strong  as  our  weakest  link.

54
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,400
Insider  threats  are  employees,
vendors,  third  parties,

55
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,760
affiliated  to  organizations.

56
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:25,605
Who  may  innocently  or  even
maliciously  gain  access  to  our

57
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:30,685
sensitive  information  and  leak
it  out  or  use  this  information

58
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:35,725
in  our  organization  to  the
detriment  of  our  organizations.

59
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,485
Unauthorized  access.

60
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:42,325
We  have  audit  violation  and
privileged  misuse  of  rights.

61
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:47,845
This  is  the  most  powerful
one  where  an  admin  can

62
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,385
elevate  his  or  her  rights.

63
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,360
and  use  it  to  conduct  something
malicious  within  our  organization.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:01,059
I'd  like  to  give  an  example  in
May  2023,  I  think  to  be  precise,

65
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:08,740
Tesla,  ex -employees  of  Tesla  leaked
or  divulged  sensitive  information

66
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,640
of  employees,  about  700  employees
in  the  organization  to  the  media.

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,000
This  personal  identifiable
information  include  names,  of

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,460
the  employees,  their  social
security  number,  payroll  data.

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,660
As  you  can  see,  these  are  employees
who  had  access  to  secret  and

70
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:39,100
confidential  information  and  then,
use  those  privileges  to  gain  access

71
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,920
into  the  sensitive  information
and  violated  the  company's  policy.

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,620
because  I  know  normally  as
an  employee,  when  you  join  an

73
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,750
organization  you  should  be  happy.

74
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,379
OK,  Ok,  now  we  are  going  to
see  how  to  make  sure  that  we

75
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,770
sign  some  agreements  or  non
-disclosure  agreements  and  all  that.

76
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,030
So  this  is  how  we  see  the
easiest  way  to  our  perimeter.

77
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,830
It's  our  identities.

78
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,150
I'll  now  like  for  us  to  see
the  visibility  gap  between  our

79
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,190
identity  and  assets,  management
tools  and  our  observability  tools.

80
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,250
I  like  to  put  this  quadrants  here.

81
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,130
This  quadrant  as  you  can
see  This  quadrant  as  you

82
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,190
can  see  We  have  the  identity
visibility  and  risk  awareness.

83
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,110
The  identity  visibility,
basically,  is  we  are  aware  of

84
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,950
the  identities  in  our  systems.

85
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,770
We  know  their  names.

86
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,770
We  know  the  credentials
of  these  identities.

87
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,810
Then  the  awareness  or
risk  awareness  is  we  can

88
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,970
easily  monitor  our  systems.

89
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,730
At  the  system  monitored,  can
we  monitor  our  activities

90
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,790
within  our  systems?

91
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,640
But  now  the  main,  what  this
quadrant  is  looking  at  is

92
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,320
the  likely  challenges  we  may
face  when  there  is  no  synergy

93
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,640
between  our  identity  and  access
management  and  observability  tools.

94
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,640
The  first  quadrant,  which  is  at
the  top,  the  green  one,  I  like

95
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,240
to  call  it  the  non -known,  but
I  call  it  the  visible  fortress.

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,060
Why  do  I  call  it
the  visible  fortress?

97
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,740
Because  the  identity  and
the  observability  tools

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,960
are  working  hand  in  hand.

99
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,560
We  know  what  users
are  in  our  systems.

100
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,520
We  know  what  they  are  doing.

101
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,780
We  know  the  resources
they  are  assessing.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,920
We  can  track  their  activities.

103
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,560
That  is  the  known  known.

104
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,560
And  sometimes  some  people
call  it  the  safety  net.

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,580
But  also,  even  within  that  quadrant,
the  known  known,  there  is  the  risk.

106
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:52,200
of  overconfidence  yes  because
sometimes  you  feel  you  have  the

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,100
right  policies  in  place  we  have  on
boarded  our  systems  properly  we  have

108
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,700
different  signals  device  are  compliant
we  have  our  identities  all  in  place

109
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,960
we  have  good  life  cycle  policies  to
see  when  an  employee  is  is  in  the

110
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,820
organization  and  when  he  exits  the
organization  after  changing  different

111
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,790
roles  But  there's  also  an  issue  of
complaisance  where  an  organization

112
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,930
becomes  so  relaxed  and  then  forget
to  monitor  or  conduct  continuous

113
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,390
access  reviews  of  the  systems.

114
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:39,590
In  2022,  an  employee  in  Uber
got  compromised  as  a  result

115
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,050
of  MFA  fatigue,  multifactor
authentication  fatigue.

116
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:53,745
She  was  sent  this  login  approver
attempt  several,  until  she  clicked

117
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,525
that  link  and  that  exposed  Uber.

118
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,885
So,  the  identity  of
the  user  was  known.

119
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:04,145
The  systems  of  course  are  monitoring
activities,  but  at  that  point  it

120
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:09,805
will  be  difficult  because  the  issue
is  the  system  will  flag  this,  flag

121
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,425
the  identity  as  an  illegitimate  user.

122
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:12,485
Thank  you.

123
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,230
was  tracking  these  activities
without  knowing  that  the

124
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,650
system  has  been  breached.

125
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,130
Let's  go  to  the  right,  the
top  right  quadrant,  which

126
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,930
is  the  known  or  known.

127
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,850
I  like  to  call  it
identities  living  in  fog.

128
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,770
Imagine  handling  the  keys  to
someone  or  giving  the  keys  to

129
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,710
your,  of  giving  the  keys  to
your  company,  or  let's  just

130
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,930
say  you  have  a  small  office.

131
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,710
with  several  rooms.

132
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,990
You  give  the  keys  to  those
of  that  office  to  a  friend.

133
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,310
Immediately  you  give  that
key  to  your  friend,  you

134
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,870
don't  even  care  what  rooms
your  friend  goes  to  check.

135
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,250
You  don't  care  what  wardrobes
your  friend  is  checking,  what

136
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,610
files  in  your  company  or  your
house  your  friend  is  checking.

137
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,570
So  this  is  what  I  call
the  known  or  known.

138
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:13,735
The  identity  is  known,  but  you
are  not  tracking  or  monitoring

139
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,635
activities  in  your  system.

140
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:20,095
With  the  use  of  AI,  artificial
intelligence,  we  have  shadow  IT  now.

141
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:25,515
Employees  downloading  AI,  large
language  models,  let's  say  for

142
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:31,035
example,  chat  GPT  and  using
it  for  daily  tasks  in  the

143
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:34,595
organizations  without  being
unnoticed  by  the  IT  departments.

144
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,655
Two  dummies.

145
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:42,515
There  might  be  data,  there
will  be  data  exfiltration

146
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:48,735
where  these  employees  diverge
sensitive  information  into  these,

147
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,395
um,  large  language  models.

148
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:55,734
This  is  a  big  risk  because  I
call  it  the  familiarity  bias.

149
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:59,934
You  are  familiar  with
these  identities,  oh,  these

150
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:03,954
are  my  employees,  but  the
activities  of  these  employees

151
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,214
are  not  being  tracked.

152
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,499
That  is  where  you  have  on
-track  software  as  a  service.

153
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,519
There's  a  free  software
on  the  internet.

154
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,199
An  employee  sees  that  software  on
the  internet,  downloads  it,  and  use

155
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:23,219
his  office  credentials  to  access
these  resources  without  being  noticed.

156
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:30,080
Let's  go  to  the  bottom  quadrant
to  the  left,  the  unknown  known.

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,834
The  unknown  known,  I  like  to
call  it,  um,  The  ghost  access

158
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:44,894
is  basically  like  seeing  your
infrastructure  on  a  dashboard

159
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:50,274
on  fire  without  knowing  who
lit  the  matches  or  without

160
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,314
knowing  the  cause  of  the  fire.

161
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:57,514
This  is  the  unknown
known,  the  unused  roles,

162
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,935
misconfiguration,  policy  gaps.

163
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:06,530
Recently,  where,  um,  a  retail
company,  yeah,  I  think  Mark  and

164
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:14,910
Spencer  through  third  party  was
briefed  as  a  result  of  third  party.

165
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,009
And  this  is  because  the  third  party,
for  example,  it  wasn't  known  that

166
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,369
it  was  through  the  third  party.

167
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,829
For  example,  through  the  third
party,  hackers  breached  into

168
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,329
Mark  and  Spencer's  system.

169
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,910
And  this  was  a  ransomware  attack.

170
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,329
Mark  and  Spencer  were
experiencing  some  fluctuations.

171
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:39,774
within  their  systems  without
knowing  what  exactly  has  or

172
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:41,334
what  caused  these  fluctuations.

173
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:45,435
So  this  is  a  case  of  unknown  known.

174
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:51,314
The  biggest  headache  of
SISOs  is  the  unknown  unknown.

175
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:55,855
I  call  this  the  invisible
people,  or  invisible

176
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,355
identities  in  visible  spaces.

177
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:06,964
this  is  where  we  you  can't  we  can't
I  identify  the  who  is  assessing  the

178
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:09,344
system,  neither  can  we  monitor  this.

179
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:12,584
For  example,  I  would
like  to  give  an  example.

180
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:20,884
Recently,  the  Lega  Aid  Agency
also  experienced  breach  where  their

181
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:28,084
system  was  assessed  and  hacked,
breached  with  personal  information,

182
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:33,964
personal  identifiable  information
of  Le  people  requesting  legal

183
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:40,385
aids  were  exposed,  information  for
the  past  15  years  were  exposed.

184
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:46,124
This  was  difficult  for  legal
aid  agency  to  know  because  at

185
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:51,664
that  time  it  was  an  antiquated
system,  an  abandoned  system,  so

186
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,885
there  was  no  way  they  could  even
track  or  know  what  was  going  on.

187
00:13:56,665 --> 00:14:06,339
Another  recent  one  is  the  case
of  NHS  Trusts  were  through  a

188
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,919
vulnerability  of  their  third
-party  endpoint  manager,

189
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,899
mobile  device  management.

190
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,240
They  were  also  hacked  as  well.

191
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:23,859
And  then  these  hackers  gained  access
to  information  about  the  devices,

192
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:30,299
the  mobile  devices,  the  IMEI
numbers,  and  even  tokens  as  well.

193
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:34,860
which  could  even  be  used  in
the  long  run  for  impersonation.

194
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,560
So  now  we  can  see  the  risk  of
this  when  there's  no  synergy  or

195
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,979
interaction  between  our  identity
and  access  management  and

196
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:52,339
observability  tools  it  provides
a  big  vacuum  in  our  organization

197
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,439
and  an  easy  way  for  hackers  to
gain  access  into  our  systems.

198
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:58,625
I

199
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:04,985
understand  that  many  organizations
are  looking  at  investing  in  identity

200
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:12,005
tools,  identity  and  access  management
tools,  observability  tools,  but  let's

201
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:17,045
not  also  forget  that  there  are  lots
of  barriers  that  has  hindered  this.

202
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:21,565
Organizations  operating  complex
infrastructure,  like  you  have  a

203
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:26,525
hybrid  system,  you  have  on -premise
systems,  you  have  some  in  the  cloud.

204
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:27,075
So  Thank  you.

205
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:27,115
Thank  you.

206
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,930
It's  difficult  to  manage.

207
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,970
You  have  your  active
directory  somewhere.

208
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,270
It's  not  synchronized  to
your  intra -active  directory.

209
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:41,410
Or,  I  gave  an  example  where  in  an
organization,  um,  about  60  percent

210
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:48,010
of,  60  percent  of,  about  60  percent
of  organizations  state  that  they  have

211
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,590
21  disparate  identities  per  user.

212
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:52,750
Thank  you  for  watching.

213
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,760
information  or  systems  in  silos.

214
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,180
They  are  not  even  communicating
with  each  other  or  we  have  a

215
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,920
security  incident  if  incident
event  management  tool  which  is

216
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,280
not  communicating  with  the  identity
and  access  management  tool.

217
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,820
Let's  not  also  forget  costs.

218
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,980
Cost  is  a  big  problem  because
when  you  sometimes  will  purchase

219
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,380
this  cloud  infrastructure  we  are
told  we  need  to  purchase  licenses.

220
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,680
In  long  run,  we  also  told,
Oh,  there's  an  add -on

221
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,000
license  we  have  to  purchase.

222
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,540
So  this  keeps  on  incurring
costs  or  we  keep  incurring

223
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,760
costs  in  our  organization.

224
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,700
But  if  you  look  at  this  cost,
sometimes  some  organizations  may

225
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,780
want  to  invest  in  these  tools,
but  step  back  until  a  breach

226
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,220
or  a  security  mishap  happens.

227
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,140
And  then  they  are  now  on  their  toes
on  investing  on  this  infrastructure.

228
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:57,025
So  these  are  big  barriers  in  our
identity  and  our  identity  aware

229
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,765
observability  tools  and  operations.

230
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:05,705
So  how  do  we  observe  assets
before  it  becomes  a  breach?

231
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,915
The  first  thing  I  will
say  is  to  always  correlate

232
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,475
identity  with  system  events.

233
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:21,765
Let  identities  and  management  tools,
let  your  logs,  your  your  identity

234
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:26,485
and  access  management  tools  interacts
for  example  you  have  your  microsoft

235
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:32,905
sentinels  your  your  intra  id  you
should  have  these  tools  communicating

236
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:41,985
audit  permissions  in  real  time  this
era  we  are  in  is  no  more  about

237
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:48,205
static  role -based  access  controls
now  permission  should  be  audited

238
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:53,720
based  on  several  signals  based
on  location,  device  compliance,

239
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,580
the  identity  of  the  users,  all
these  brought  together  and  this

240
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,960
should  be  done  in  real  time.

241
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,200
For  example,  before  a  user  signs
in,  there  should  be  like,  to  be

242
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,080
able  to  assess  the  state  of  the
user  at  that  point  in  time  before

243
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,280
that  user  can  assess  any  resource.

244
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,640
There  should  be  detection
of  insider  threats.

245
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,900
Incorporate  tools  that  can  easily
check  for  the  use  of  shadow  AI.

246
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,160
Incorporate  tools  that  can  easily
scan  our  systems  and  see  different

247
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,240
resources  that  are  not  meant
to  be  used  in  our  environment.

248
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,080
Incorporate  tools  that  can
implement  data  loss  preventions

249
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,200
in  your  organization  to  avoid
exfiltration  of  sensitive  information.

250
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,340
Align  with  Zero  Trust.

251
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,060
As  I  said  earlier,  identity
is  our  new  perimeter.

252
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,300
So  we  should  always  assume
breach  and  always  verify  every

253
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,280
identity  before  they  can  gain
access  into  our  resources.

254
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,500
And  of  course,  we  should  enforce
least  privilege  compliance.

255
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,379
We  do  lots  of,  we
have  DEVRA  compliance.

256
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,310
From  our  health,  for  example,
we  have  HIPAA,  we  have  GDPR,  we

257
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,510
have  NIST,  we  have  many  of  them.

258
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,150
We  should  be  compliant  to,  to
these  rules  and  regulations.

259
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,670
And  this  will  also  help  us
in  auditing  and  checking  for

260
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,170
loopholes  in  our  organizations.

261
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,090
This  will  help  us  check  out  and
review  our  assets  and  see  what

262
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,230
is  lagging  behind  in  our  system.

263
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,310
Thank  you.

264
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,230
I  wouldn't  want  to  call  names,
but  we  have  lots  of  tools  that  we

265
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,130
can  use  now  in  our  organizations.

266
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,310
We  have  the  Microsoft
Defender  for  cloud  apps.

267
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,730
You  can  use  it  to  scan  your  cloud
environment  to  see  what  applications

268
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,590
are  being  used  in  your  environment.

269
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,830
We  have  Sentinel,  good
security,  um,  security  incident

270
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,350
and  event  management  tools.

271
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,770
We  have  data  governance  tools,
data  governance  and  compliance

272
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,210
tools  like  the  Microsoft  Pub.

273
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:07,195
Um,  um,  um,  um,  um,  um,  um.

274
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,755
But  I  know  that  thing  I  would
like  to  say  is  not  about  having

275
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:14,235
these  tools  is  about  knowing
that  uh,  we  are  sure  that  these

276
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:18,395
tools  are  interacting  with  each
order  and  are  not  in  silo.

277
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:22,655
I  have  stated  all  these
frameworks,  but  at  the  same

278
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,635
time,  let's  also  know  that  this
is  not  like  a  hundred  percent.

279
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:32,035
Where  in  which  your  system
wouldn't  be  breached  in  any  way.

280
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:38,335
That  is  why  there  should  also  be
need  for  good  incident  response.

281
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:42,915
We  should  be  able  to  contain
and  recover  quickly  from  any

282
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:47,055
breach  that  happens  in  our
environment  or  in  our  organization.

283
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:52,515
Matured  cyber  security  isn't
about  how  many  attacks  you

284
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:58,255
stopped  or  how  many  cyber  attacks
you've  been  able  to  manage.

285
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:05,865
What  it  is  also  about  How  you
are  able  to  contain  and  recover

286
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:11,045
from  any  form  of  breach  your
experience  because  some  of  these

287
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:14,985
breaches  are  actually  unavoidable.

288
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:22,365
For  example,  I  gave  an  example
about  NHS,  NHS  Trust  encountered

289
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:29,025
a  breach  as  a  result  of  a
vulnerability  within  their  third  party

290
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,085
mobile  device  management  software.

291
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:37,865
so  that  is  why  we  all  need  to
have  think  about  having  good  incident

292
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:44,785
response  plan  in  our  organization
i'll  also  now  draw  attention  to  this

293
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:51,245
let's  take  time  in  our  organization
let's  rethink  about  our  observability

294
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:59,865
our  identity  and  access  management
because  access  isn't  a  checkbox

295
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:07,465
anymore  It  is  now  an  attack  surface
and  observability  without  access  is

296
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:14,165
like  a  security  theater  because  you
are  just  watching  without  knowing

297
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,925
who  is  assessing  your  resources,
what  activities  are  going  on.

298
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:24,045
So  I  would  like  to  say  with
this,  I  enjoin  everyone  to

299
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:30,055
look  into  this,  look  at  the
organization,  check  what's  going  on.

300
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:38,060
is  going  on  and  how  to
improve  in  an  identity  and

301
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,040
observability  aware  environment.

302
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,380
Thank  you.
