1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,249
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:04,939
I'm Victor Gabriel, a season supply
chain consultant from GP Worldwide.

3
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm thrilled to be here speaking at
Prompt Engineering 2025 conference.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:14,509
Today I'll be sharing a success story
on how we have helped a global food

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:21,470
manufacturer to uncover about $30 million
in cost savings using a Power BI tool with

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,660
the embedded prompt engineering framework.

7
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:29,165
In the next few minutes, I'll walk you
through the challenge that we had on

8
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:33,155
hand and the approach we've taken and the
solution framework we have developed, and

9
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:38,375
perhaps we will learn how the solution
can be used to implement, to solve similar

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,254
business problems across other industries.

11
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:45,474
Now with that, looking at the
challenge, this particular client

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:49,614
is a $15 billion food manufacturer
with a huge number of contact

13
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,744
manufacturers across North Americas.

14
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:58,285
So like many large organizations
today, they do struggled with scattered

15
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:03,295
data across multiple systems, limited
visibility into real-time cost

16
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:08,725
information, slow identification of
margin, leakages, and difficulty turning

17
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,035
data into meaningful de decisions.

18
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:14,550
Now, for them, Excel
dashboards weren't enough.

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:19,715
They needed something faster, smarter,
and easier to use for their employees.

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,020
Now what we've done was, as part
of the solution, we have developed

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,970
a hybrid analytics approach.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,090
Now, this framework was built using a
power BI for structure and Microsoft

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,160
copilot for intelligent prompts.

24
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,055
Now, while Power BI gave reliable
real-time dashboards, explaining or

25
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:44,930
conveying the data, co-pilot added a
prompt driven layer where users could

26
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,300
simply ask questions with quick answers.

27
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:52,175
This made analysis, instant
decisions that once took hours.

28
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:55,145
Now it just take few minutes or seconds.

29
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,345
Diving a little bit into
the platform architecture.

30
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:03,145
The architecture rests on three
key pillars, power BI Foundation.

31
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,605
That's where the realtime
dashboards are developed.

32
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:09,085
Presenting the data facts,
prompt engineering layer.

33
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:12,895
This is where the scenario modeling
is done through the Microsoft copilot.

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,950
The integration engine, this is where
connecting the data connects happens with

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,670
a multiple across multiple manufacturing
systems, supply portals, finance data

36
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,910
to form a single source of truth.

37
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,830
Now, together with all three pillars,
it gives us a single source of growth

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,660
and a rapid insight generation.

39
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,930
Yeah, looking into the
prompt engineering in action.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,370
So what it actually means.

41
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,845
Analysts could talk directly to data.

42
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:41,715
That's what it means.

43
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,805
They can ask any question they
may want, they can ask a question.

44
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:50,704
Hey, you know why my scrap rate went
down in scrap rates were high in Q3.

45
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:51,245
Why?

46
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:56,605
What factors have I actually contributed
to the most to the scrap varis and Q3?

47
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,145
And the system responds with
visuals without within no

48
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,365
time, and summarizes instantly.

49
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,405
No manual analysis is needed.

50
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:08,845
Prompt engineering made advanced
analytics accessible to everyone,

51
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,525
not just the data scientists.

52
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:15,105
Now the approach, talking about the
approach now that we have the framework

53
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,295
here, is the approach for execution.

54
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:23,765
The focus was was what was the focus
was kept on two major levers, the margin

55
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,865
performance and the cost optimization.

56
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,830
Margin performance.

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,490
That's where, the focus
was on conversion cost.

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,290
The overall yield profitability per
product, and the cost optimization.

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,520
That's where the supplier
cost benchmarking was done.

60
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,870
Packaging efficiencies the metrics
were looked at and the production

61
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,520
process improvement initiatives.

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,280
Now, by targeting these, we could quickly
see where the money was being lost and

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,645
where the improvements can be made.

64
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:56,105
Now talking about the timing
now, usually for projects like

65
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,605
this, timing is everything.

66
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:01,505
This solution was launched during
a major corporate restructuring,

67
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:06,245
key insights, guided leadership
decisions telling them which applies

68
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,655
to consolidate, which to grow, with
which to shift production, directly

69
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,175
supported company's new operating model.

70
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,885
And these are the results,
the transformative impact.

71
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,420
The impact was pretty clear.

72
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,400
30 million was achieved in savings
across scrap and conversion costs.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,970
When I mentioned scrap it's coming
from the raw material and packaging

74
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,890
scrap from the pro, from the from the
products and the conversion costs.

75
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:33,659
Now that's number one.

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,969
And faster decisions were made
with more transparency and the

77
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,619
supply performance were improved.

78
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,889
And it also helped us with
the real time tracking.

79
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:46,965
And the platform paid for
itself several times over.

80
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:50,924
It, it was almost a good number
of written over written on

81
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,104
investment as one of the results.

82
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:58,184
Now here is the real world application.

83
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:04,314
Now, one of the major findings that we
saw as the outcomes were the scrap rates

84
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:07,374
were 15% above the industry benchmarks.

85
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:13,844
That have contributed to losing
a lot of money wasting millions.

86
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:17,504
Now using the prompt driven
insights, we found consistent

87
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,554
product recipes across suppliers.

88
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,635
Now remember we are talking
about the food manufacturer

89
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,905
and the product is a is a food.

90
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:29,974
You can say it can be a candy or
it can be an energy bar, or it

91
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:33,224
can be any food I, any food item.

92
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,604
So now think about.

93
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:39,449
The product recipe now, making it
streamlining the product recipes

94
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,059
would help now, and that is not easy.

95
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:46,049
So one of the things we were able to
fix it by standardizing the formulas

96
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,649
food formulas the renegotiating the
supply contracts, adding the live

97
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:55,119
performance alerts supply performance
alerts, and within 18 months,

98
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:59,319
the food scrap raw material and
packaging scrap was at the industry.

99
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:07,179
Best levels now that has given the the
client about $30 million in savings.

100
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,400
Now, what lessons have we learned?

101
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,729
Just in general?

102
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,979
In general, from executing this project?

103
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,889
Always start the business questions.

104
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,229
Start with the business
questions, not with tools.

105
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,689
What what the tools are important.

106
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,744
But starting off with the business
questions is primary is most important.

107
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:29,754
And ensuring the data quality
early on is important too.

108
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:32,194
Poor data just, kills the good analytics.

109
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,754
Work across work cross-functionally.

110
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:40,034
When we say the data, the the, one
of the pillars of the framework

111
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,294
was the integration engine.

112
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,794
It is important that we.

113
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,564
We weed the data.

114
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:48,884
We are able to integrate the data,
transform the data that comes

115
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:52,334
from it, that comes from finance,
that comes from operations,

116
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,224
that comes from supply portals.

117
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:57,764
Now, working cross-functional with
the cross-functional teams is quite

118
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:03,244
important now, and using the AI
wisely now it should enhance and

119
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,834
not replace the human judgment.

120
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,944
As we are using the copilot to
support web, making some of the

121
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:13,354
decisions, data driven decisions,
it is not to replace entirely.

122
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:17,474
But it just arguments
enhances the human judgment.

123
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,334
Those were the, some of the lessons we
have learned from executing this project.

124
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:25,124
From insight to action, what
was the overall decision

125
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:26,924
cycle that we have observed?

126
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:31,664
Now, a quick reminder that, how
insights are turned into action.

127
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,184
First is the data integration.

128
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:39,014
This is where the real time updates
from all the sources are aggregated now.

129
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:43,334
Then the visual discovery, visualize
and spot trends in the dashboards.

130
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:48,164
Then the prompt driven analysis, asking
the questions, testing the scenarios

131
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:53,034
with ai in this case, the co-pilot,
but you can also use the L lms.

132
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,485
Synthesizing the copilot generates
the summaries for executives so that

133
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:01,294
the data-driven decisions can help
make some of the meaningful business

134
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:05,884
decisions and the implementers
obviously making the decisions and

135
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,895
acting on them, launching the project.

136
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,014
And launching the initiatives,
the team are acting on it

137
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,424
and monitoring those results.

138
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,819
And we go back in the cycle to refine it.

139
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,789
So this loops keep kept on the keep the
continuously, it kept, it needs to be

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,659
kept continuously improving from data
to decision and decision to action.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,789
So that's it's a virtuous cycle now.

142
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,409
The practical Brooklyn, if we have
to get started on similar projects

143
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:36,409
way to get started in your projects.

144
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,520
If you are looking at how can
we implement a kind of a similar

145
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:46,324
framework to realize cost savings
using a similar solution framework.

146
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:51,124
First, identify three to five
high impact areas, then build a

147
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:55,474
simple power BI dashboard, then
layer in a copilot gradually.

148
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,560
So first is a Power BI dashboard.

149
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,190
Make sure that you know the data you have
the data and you're able to spot trends.

150
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,170
Then on top of it goes of the
co-pilot or any LLN and then track

151
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,030
the insights that leads into actions.

152
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,000
And the fifth one is the
scale and standardize.

153
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,690
Once it is proven, it's all
about proving the value early

154
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,370
and then expanding it fast.

155
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:25,315
So that can be a successful blueprint in
order to execute for similar projects.

156
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,085
Now talking about the future,
this is just the beginning of ai,

157
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,095
augmented supply chain intelligence.

158
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,855
Now next comes the predictive analytics.

159
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:37,855
We just have the prompt engineering
layer, and next comes the predictive

160
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:42,350
analytics, automated recommendations
and risk forecasting all blended.

161
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,370
Blending the structured
data with adaptive ai.

162
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,930
So whether you are tracking the margins,
erosion, or supplier optimization or

163
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:55,060
network complexity, remember Power bi,
it just gives a structure and prompt

164
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,190
engineering, it gives us the agility.

165
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,720
It just gives us that speed.

166
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,910
Now together it'll give us a
clarity of thought clarity of the

167
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,055
business performance with the speed
at the, at a good rate of speed.

168
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:11,755
Now I really appreciate, again for
this opportunity that was given

169
