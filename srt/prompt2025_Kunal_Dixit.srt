1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,330
Hello all and good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:07,900
My name is Al. I work for Gensar
Technologies as a delivery manager at this

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,720
conference of Prompt Engineering 2025.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,970
We are going to share our experiences
on the supply chain residency model,

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,430
what we faced during the pandemic.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,505
In this particular session, we are gonna
talk about some key challenges, what

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,875
automation was done, how it was done.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,755
What are the key takeaways?

9
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:29,974
So let's dive in.

10
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:34,554
We all know that the COVID-19
pandemic gave us a very different

11
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:36,235
world what we are hearing today.

12
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:42,015
All those unprecedented disruptions made
it very difficult to operate the way it

13
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:48,525
was over the regular non activities which
were physically allowed were restricted.

14
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:53,074
Restrictions, workforce
limitations and everything

15
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,665
became very difficult to manage.

16
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:59,184
That was a wake up call to
initiate a digital transformation.

17
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:04,465
When I say digital transform
transformation, I'm talking about how do

18
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:10,104
we make sure that the manual processes
and physical dependencies are managed in

19
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:15,705
such a way that you get an accelerated
digital experience, all those activities.

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,214
Are required for the survival in
this crisis world, and that basically

21
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:26,474
emerges you as a stronger, more
resilient partner in the industry.

22
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:27,695
Let's see.

23
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:31,164
What are the things that
we took as action today?

24
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:34,345
In this journey, we are gonna talk
about some of the crisis management,

25
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:39,049
some automation solutions, the
resiliency framework that we built.

26
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,899
How the residency framework helped
us in the digital acceleration and as

27
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,799
part of the digital acceleration, what
strategic advantages were achieved.

28
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,049
We also examined the lessons from Gensa
technology, supply chain transformation,

29
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:56,789
and provide some actionable takeaways
for strengthening the resilience

30
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,349
against future disrupts, while
unlocking sustained efficiency gains.

31
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,349
Looking at the deep vulner.

32
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,764
The pandemic exposed to us.

33
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:11,695
First of all, what used to work in
the office environment is disrupted.

34
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,435
That is not going to work.

35
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,204
All those paper based order processing,
email coordinations, spreadsheet

36
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:21,804
tracking, that is a bottleneck
when it comes to remote working.

37
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:26,174
The physical presence requirements in
terms of field operations, equipment

38
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:30,854
installation, partner training,
all those because of the lockdown.

39
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:33,224
Were not able to process.

40
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,374
It was everything was at fault.

41
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:39,594
At the same time, in terms of supply
chain, inventory is the key, as you

42
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:44,934
all know, inventory had a limited
visibility and limited visibility,

43
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:50,195
meaning delayed information leads to
delayed decisions, which basically

44
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,135
amplifies the impact of this disruptions.

45
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:56,845
And then coming to our infrastructure,
which is the networking piece.

46
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:01,334
The centralized and inflexible
network basically means it's

47
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,315
a single point of failure.

48
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,715
If one note goes down, your
environment is collapsed.

49
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:12,535
There was no plan B because Plan
A always worked, but that was

50
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,425
not the case during the pandemic.

51
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:19,245
So what is the operation lifeline
of Partners and Field Automation?

52
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:20,115
Let's take a look at that.

53
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,130
Will build the threat here.

54
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,880
So patent field automation emerge
as an essential capability for

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,380
organizations navigating the pandemic.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,269
Other than doing incremental
improvements, those technologies

57
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,200
provided transformation capabilities
that enable business continuity.

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
Under the extraordinary constraints.

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,420
Through automation of order
processing, digital partner

60
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,799
enablement and remote field operations
organizations maintain a critical

61
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,990
function while competitors struggle.

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,890
At Gensar, we implemented these
technologies strategies and have shown

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,530
that how the world has changed and how it
is important to recover from the crisis.

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,160
In terms of taking a top bottom
approach, we basically divided

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,230
the work in three areas.

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,550
First is order capture second processing.

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,720
Third is fulfillment.

68
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:15,355
So automated intake from the
partners through API integration

69
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,765
eliminated manual data entry.

70
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,355
That was the first step that was taken.

71
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,615
Second is about processing and
validation of the particular order

72
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:26,145
in our new middleware system, which
had checked the inventory, checked

73
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:29,985
the routing options, everything was
done without a human intervention.

74
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,925
And third, and lastly is the fulfillment.

75
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,915
Which is basically about triggering
the shipping, updating the systems

76
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,905
in terms of if the shipment has
received or not, and receiving and

77
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,855
creating notifications in real time.

78
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:47,465
And as an impact, the transition
latency dropped dramatically.

79
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,690
Orders that used to take days
previously now are taking hours.

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,330
Remote teams maintain full
operational capability without

81
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,885
physical presence in the office.

82
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,405
That enabled continuity.

83
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:05,139
When lockdown was actually in focus,
going further down, we had also

84
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,029
enabled direct partner equipment
shipping and digital tracking.

85
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:10,929
That means we have real-time visibility.

86
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:15,309
We have streamline distribution
and automated notifications.

87
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:20,069
In terms of real time visibility,
GPS and IOT sensors were used

88
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,729
extensively to eliminate any
uncertainty during the shipping status.

89
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:28,339
Enabling proactive exception management
in terms of distribution rather than

90
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,269
going, rather than taking the equipment
and shipping it to the centralized

91
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:38,119
warehouse, we bypass that and directly
ship to the customer's partners location.

92
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,739
That basically accelerated
the delivery times.

93
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,319
And in terms of tracking.

94
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,609
The automated notifications were
enabled in terms of every milestone in

95
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:53,269
terms of dispatch, transit shipment,
and that was all done through emails.

96
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,059
This particular approach transformed
distribution from liability

97
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,379
into a competitive advantage.

98
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:05,565
Partner received equipment faster
with full transparency, while internal

99
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,655
team focused on strategy activities
rather than tracking shipments only.

100
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:12,094
Going into remote configuration,
virtual training to add up to

101
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,315
what we did in the past, right?

102
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:18,335
In terms of order management
validation, milestone, and

103
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,135
creating the real time tracking.

104
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:24,840
We also enabled a remote configuration
and virtual training platforms.

105
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,275
It was added up in terms of giving
a more further partner satisfaction.

106
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:34,879
Remote configuration was enabled in such
a way that technicians could remotely

107
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,030
configure equipment, eliminate Tinder
travel needs automated configuration

108
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,099
templates, ensure consistency and
digital audits had a compliance

109
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,719
documentation without any paperwork.

110
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,460
To enhance that further, we created
a virtual training platforms,

111
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:54,609
which had interactive modules
enabling partner training.

112
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:59,219
On demand access and automated
assessment, which was basically

113
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:03,899
checking the competency and identify
any knowledge gaps as a business.

114
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,609
Impact operations.

115
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:09,719
Team operations that previously
require expensive site visit

116
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,999
that was not required anymore.

117
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,764
Part development, accelerated expanding
capacity while travel budgets were

118
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:19,084
still frozen because of the pandemic.

119
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:22,525
The shift to remote operations
became permanent delivering sustained

120
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,715
cost savings beyond the crisis.

121
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:29,234
Coming to the resilient design framework,
building for the Insanity, we took

122
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,824
a modular architecture approach.

123
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,754
We broke it down.

124
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:36,104
The architecture has to be modular
in such a way that component based

125
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:40,364
system allowed a rapid configuration
and modular replacement, significantly

126
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:41,299
reducing irr irrigated times.

127
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,349
We had automated monitoring installed.

128
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:49,359
That way we can check the real time
health of the systems creating any issues.

129
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,769
In addition to that, there were
simulation testing scenarios created

130
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:58,569
to make sure that everything is running
as robust during the crisis management.

131
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,569
And to back up, we had a comprehensive
documentation in place to have

132
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,719
insured, which had rapid onboarding.

133
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:10,874
Proper knowledge transfer
continuity management during

134
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,374
the staff ordinary times.

135
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:17,674
As a result, we could see that if
you look at the chart from fully

136
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:21,904
automated to traditional approaches,
operation organizations, which

137
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:27,285
were working in the automated mode,
can see a 15 times faster recovery

138
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,025
rate in terms of traditional peers.

139
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:33,285
And that is what we achieved
during this automation phase.

140
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:37,055
So the key insight is that
recovery speed directly correlated

141
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:37,985
with the digital maturity.

142
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,835
Automation provided the agility
needed to pivot the operations quickly

143
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:45,265
while manual processes had frictions.

144
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:50,205
So this was the recovery rate that we
see and that had augmented everything

145
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,825
in terms of how we move from manual
processes to automated processes.

146
00:08:55,325 --> 00:09:00,665
Now how do we get into a digital
adoption mode and act as an accelerator?

147
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:06,535
So the digital piece is done, but now
it needs to be adapted by partners

148
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,185
and also the vendor management.

149
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:12,715
So there was an adoption speed that
was put into place, activities that

150
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,665
used to take years, but done in months.

151
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:19,195
We had remote monitoring
to for organizations, which

152
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,305
enabled real time monitoring.

153
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:25,315
We did investment in terms of post
pandemic budget ion for supply chain

154
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:31,315
automation compared to pre COVID
levels, and as we know that the

155
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:33,355
ion era is going to be sustained.

156
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:37,525
So we, there was a need for,
to have a permanent operational

157
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,685
improvement done on all these areas.

158
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,880
So what are the key capabilities
for long-term efficiency?

159
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,810
The first, as I mentioned,
remote monitoring.

160
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,710
Without a physical presence,
how do I make sure that my

161
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,420
equipment's health is maintained?

162
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,340
There is a self-healing into place.

163
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,350
How does the supply chain status keeps,
continues to operate functionally?

164
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,230
And I get the statuses of those supply
chain module as and when we move

165
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,550
the equipment from one the store.

166
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,850
Second is about real time
inventory visibility.

167
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:10,105
Automated tracking across the
entire supply chain, enabling

168
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:13,945
data driven decisions, and
reducing the stockouts by 60%.

169
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:18,295
That's a big number in terms of,
because when it comes to supply

170
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:19,705
chain, inventory is your key.

171
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:25,675
If you run out of stock, that means
your entire pipeline is stuck, and we

172
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,495
want to make sure that never happens.

173
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,135
Contactless fulfillment.

174
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:34,795
Automated, picking, shipping,
packing, all those key things are

175
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:39,055
done, contracted contactless because
the systems are, put 'em in such

176
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,005
a way that they work seamlessly.

177
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:44,400
What are the practical approaches
that we took during the automation?

178
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,385
So embedding automation
into a supply chain.

179
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,515
We started with a pain point.

180
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,465
We identified the high friction processes
causing the most operational pain.

181
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,064
That was the first thing
on the drawing board.

182
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:59,575
From there, we understood that
we have to make sure that our

183
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:01,765
architecture is modular in nature.

184
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:04,555
That way whenever changes have
to be done, they are rapid,

185
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,564
faster, and easier to maintain.

186
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:10,785
After the modulation of the
infrastructure, we worked towards the

187
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,824
integration of the partner ecosystem.

188
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:16,114
We want to make sure that
the two residency requires.

189
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,224
Coordination across the entire supply
chain network, including partners

190
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,294
ecosystem and event ecosystem.

191
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:27,564
We invested in training, making sure
that everybody understands what are

192
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:33,804
the areas that needs to be done to
for effective supply chain management.

193
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:37,704
And at the last we did test and iterate.

194
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:41,414
Regular solution testing
varies residency, so continuous

195
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,574
improvement ensures systems evolve.

196
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:45,014
While changing needs.

197
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:49,194
So these approaches aren't just
theoretical, they are practical

198
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:52,345
lessons from the organization that
successfully navigated the pandemic.

199
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:59,454
So basically you start small, prove a
value, and then scale systematically,

200
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:02,185
as in when you move towards your goal.

201
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:05,579
What are the strategic advantages
and why digital maturity matters?

202
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,969
As we know that the enhanced agility
basically means that your rapid

203
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:16,010
response to market change allowing
organizations to quickly pivot operations,

204
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:20,749
reconfigure supply networks, and
uncertainty becomes an opportunity.

205
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:22,719
Second is our partner enablement.

206
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,229
Automated tools and real time
collaboration strengths, ecosystem

207
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:30,939
relationship partners amplify
capacity without signifying

208
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:31,854
significant cost increase.

209
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:36,935
Third and during competitive advantage,
automation provides permanent

210
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:42,844
benefits, lower cost, faster cycles,
and superior customer experience.

211
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,324
This creates a sustainable
market differentiation.

212
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:51,685
Coming to the final key takeaways, what
are what we did in terms of building

213
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:53,215
a resilient supply chain network?

214
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,825
So automation is non-negotiable.

215
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,439
In today's world of ai, that
is how it's going to be.

216
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:05,069
And pandemic proved that the manual
processes are just not going to sustain.

217
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:09,189
Partners and field automation are
an option, but they are essential

218
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,139
capabilities for the modern supply chain.

219
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,094
Operating in uncertain environments,
agency requires in additional design.

220
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,305
It this particular activity did not
just happen over as an accident.

221
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:21,325
They implement the
resolution design framework.

222
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:25,765
You have to have a architecture approach,
automated monitoring, simulation,

223
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:31,405
testing, complex documentation, so
all were deliberate actions for the

224
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:35,775
choices of the architecture that we
took that gave us a digital maturity

225
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,030
and drive competition advantage.

226
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,579
Organizations with mature automation
capabilities recover 15 times faster.

227
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,280
We know that based on the
chart, at the same time, the

228
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,109
stockout options was 60% less.

229
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:53,019
That this is a big number that gives
digital maturity, agility, and enables

230
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,920
partner ecosystems and delivers
sustained efficiency beyond the crisis.

231
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,699
And so final point is start now and you
have to build incrementally, begin with

232
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,640
a high impact pain point, build modular.

233
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,770
Integrate partners, test them regularly
because next disruptions is inevitable.

234
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,380
But the question is,
are you ready for that?

235
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,870
That's my last slide.

236
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,850
Thank you so much for this opportunity
in terms of giving me into this

237
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,460
session and I had a great time.

238
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,010
Hope you had some great,
lovely, thank you so much.
