1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,430
I am excited to be here today
at 42 to talk about something

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,049
that affects all of us, how AI
is changing our work and skills.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,630
AI coding assistant, Chachi, pt,
GitHub copilot, cursor winder.

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:22,130
They have made our development faster and
easier, but they bring real challenges.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,110
So we need to ensure that as AI
takes over repetitive tasks, we

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,410
don't lose our ability to think.

8
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:36,905
Critically or creatively and to
be en to ensure that if we are the

9
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,125
ones that are solving the problem.

10
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,485
So that's exactly what we
are going to explore today.

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,165
So let's get started.

12
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:51,185
AI makes coding easier, let's be honest,
but it can also make us mentally lazy

13
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:52,865
if you are not really careful about it.

14
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:56,345
So there is something called
metacognitive laziness.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,830
It happens when we rely too much
on something, in this case, ai,

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,690
and we stop thinking critically
and engaging with our work.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,010
So this is actually an issue I. And,
researcher learned about, something

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:20,690
called ai, chatbot induced cognitive
therapy or short for ai, C-C-I-C-A.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,100
This is where developers, lose their
critical thinking skills over the time.

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,340
So it's not just on a
day, but over the time.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,550
Just like muscle, we can without
exercise our coding and problem

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,810
solving skills deteriorate when
AI does all the work for us.

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:47,060
Another big problem in addition to
laziness would be skill degradation with

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,240
AI providing instant answers would skip.

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,490
The why and the how of coding, which
is very important in learning process.

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,270
beginners in particular would
risk developing a shallow

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,280
grasp of programming concept.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,530
Debugging is another issue.

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,320
AI often finds and fixes the
bugs, especially with the new

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,810
tools such as windsurf and cursor.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,660
So this means developers do not get
their hands on practice like they

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,239
used to, and, they wouldn't have
the tendency to improve themselves.

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,880
So over the time, I believe our
mental muscle memory would be getting

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,399
weaker and weaker, and it would
make really hard for us to solve

35
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,859
complex problems independently.

36
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:42,675
So a real world studies are
already showing skill degradation.

37
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,695
this is due to the AI reliance.

38
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,975
So think of yourself, how often.

39
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:55,594
Do you use chat g pt? three years
ago we're using any tool, AI tool,

40
00:02:55,654 --> 00:03:00,364
maybe other than Grammarly to check
your grammar or something like that.

41
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:05,945
So as a new modern individuals,
we are getting more reliant on ai.

42
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,015
So actually a study found.

43
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:17,375
That nearly 69%, students reported
laziness and, 27 lost their decision

44
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,415
making skills because of ai.

45
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,625
So experts have drawn.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,959
Pilots to aviation because when pilots
rely too much on, autopilot, their ability

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,109
to fly manually, fly a airplane or any
sort of aircraft such as, helicopter,

48
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,240
it would decline significantly.

49
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,300
So the same could happen to,
developers and engineers.

50
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,920
If we led AI to thinking for us, and
we would be just, Additional tool

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,260
for the AI to handle the system.

52
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,350
So how do we combat this?

53
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,410
One solution is to build a culture
of, continuous learning, which is

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,840
very important on individual level.

55
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,610
many companies provide
e-learning platforms.

56
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,210
And sponsors professional certifications.

57
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,500
And another one would be knowledge
sharing, like tech talks,

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,289
forums, would help developers
keep learning from each other.

59
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,920
And, another one would
be like, something like.

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,590
hacker rank, which is a platform
or lead code, which would allow our

61
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,810
developers to practice real world
coding challenges and stay sharp.

62
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,690
this is just for developers, right?

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,970
But think of AI engineers.

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,040
We don't have to many provide coding.

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,969
We can provide different questions where
they would actually go and, practice or

66
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:47,340
do their best or challenge themselves.

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,109
In this case, hacker rank and
lead code would be suitable,

68
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,879
for example, developers.

69
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,690
another effective strategy is focusing
on hands-on projects that would

70
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,560
push developers to think critically.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,890
passion projects, r and d prototypes
and internal coding competitions.

72
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
These would keep developers
actively engaged.

73
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,249
So hackathons, are great way to
force developers and not only

74
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:25,010
developers who are going and attending
as, a team, but also as a judge.

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,989
It would, encourage them to solve unique,
challenges or observe people who are,

76
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,450
solving unique challenges and judge
them and learn from their, practices.

77
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,359
And, someone who's joining, hackathons.

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,979
I believe the individual would be
under the pressure and they would

79
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,559
practice working on under the pressure.

80
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,120
So it is very valuable.

81
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,660
The key takeaway is that we
are learning by doing, right?

82
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,290
So it is a best way to maintain,
unless, in the future we're gonna

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,560
have chip in our head, we are
gonna just install the information.

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,550
But at this stage, learning by
doing, is the best, follow of us.

85
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:11,355
Now one of the best ways to keep
developers sharp is, mentorship

86
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,445
and collaborative, work.

87
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,385
It can be coding, it can be brainstorming.

88
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:23,105
So when experienced developer guide
a junior through problem solving,

89
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,835
both part would be learning.

90
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:32,875
a way, person who is, for example, a
senior developer, they would, revisit

91
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:37,945
their knowledge and at the same time,
a junior would be learning from the,

92
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:43,045
team member and try to understand what
are the best practices in terms of.

93
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:47,735
Coding or programming or in, in
terms of architectural decisions.

94
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:53,555
For example, in pair programming,
one person would question the AI

95
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:59,735
generate code and that would lead
to a deeper discussion in team.

96
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,550
Another one would be, code reviews.

97
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,150
If code reviews, require developers,
either if the individual is a junior

98
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,760
person, mid-level, or senior, it would,
give them a opportunity to explain

99
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,070
their understanding from generated code.

100
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,530
And obviously as a business owner or
who, who is less technical, they would

101
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:29,359
feel a more confident on, Written
code where we literally used, AI

102
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,909
as a co-pilot rather than co-pilot.

103
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,310
So it is very important to have code
reviews, pair programming, collaborative

104
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,950
communication and practices, as a team.

105
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,830
So the key is to use AI responsibly
without becoming dependent.

106
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,260
I would say try solving problem
on your own first before using ai.

107
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,239
all this would ensure you to engage in
what would be the potential solution.

108
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,979
And then re reflective practices like, how
would solve without ai, would help and may

109
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,649
maintaining your critical thinking skills.

110
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,559
Also, AI should enhance, right?

111
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:14,490
It shouldn't replace you You
do not underestimate human

112
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,849
intelligence, although it works
completely different in comparison

113
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,770
to AI or artificial intelligence.

114
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,750
But it is there for you to
support you, not to replace you.

115
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,330
That is why, make sure that
you use it as a co-pilot, you

116
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,280
being pilot at the same time.

117
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,750
One of the most effective ways
to keep developers, engaged and

118
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,950
sharp is by exposing us developers
to different projects and ideas.

119
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,460
So it doesn't have to be
project at the same time.

120
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,330
we have different problems for
same domain, and we've got same

121
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,750
problem in different domains,
but applied differently.

122
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,490
So project rotation.

123
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,210
Would help developers work on different
code bases and, it would, help problem

124
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,760
solve with the problem solving skills
and preventing them from, other

125
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,840
specializations, which is, very important,
especially at this time and age.

126
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,460
tech workshops, hack days, dojo, sim,
would simulate continuous improvement.

127
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,560
and they would give the opportunity to
have hands-on collaboration with others.

128
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,310
Systems like, by Spotify and
ais, they created the communities

129
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,020
where developers practice skills
together and share best practices.

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,680
So the key is to encourage peer
learning, ensuring that, developers

131
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,080
remain adequate and capable of,
first of all, understanding,

132
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,720
then solving the new problems.

133
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:52,805
AI has significantly boosted, developed
productivity and the big deal.

134
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:58,015
We all know that, but especially when
it comes to, coding tasks or coding

135
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,555
related tasks, it really helped us like.

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,590
Documentation, writing and refactoring.

137
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,910
a McKinsey study found that a developers
complete programming task up to two x

138
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,310
faster than using AI coding assistance,
documentation writing, which is related

139
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,260
to coding but not coding itself.

140
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,510
a factoring of documentations.

141
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,520
They were improved by 50
to 67% with, AI assistance.

142
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,430
So it really reduced the
time spent on low value.

143
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,259
Tasks in, stack Order flows 2024.

144
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:37,869
Developer survey 81 personal developers
cited increased productivity.

145
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,539
I, myself, personally, I think it's great.

146
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,760
It helps with the, writing
and understanding of the code,

147
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,290
and you are becoming fast.

148
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,280
But while AI speeds up the development
process, it is crucial that we use

149
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,619
it wisely to ensure that we are
still building and refining, our

150
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:00,069
problem solving skills, which is
very important in the long run.

151
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,880
AI is powerful and valuable tool.

152
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:07,704
But it should complement, not replace.

153
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:13,104
To structure the right balance, we
need to use AI as a learning tool.

154
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:18,204
Developers should always review
the AI generated code to understand

155
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,425
the why and the how behind it.

156
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,935
So deliberate practice is a key.

157
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:27,494
Maybe a code might work AI generat
code, but you should, as a developer

158
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:32,614
or engineer, you need to understand the
why and how behind, that specific code.

159
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:37,464
So deliberate practice a key solving
problems without ai critically.

160
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,239
To maintain the strong
problem solving is case.

161
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,890
Do not just jump on the copilot chat,
g PT or rec cascade from the venture.

162
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,830
Just try to understand the
error, on the terminal.

163
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,610
I. Critical, review of AI generic code
is essential maybe with a team member

164
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,860
or by yourself throughout development.

165
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,860
So treat AI like a junior developer
that is there for you forever, right?

166
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,140
So make sure that you actually go
and verify the work of the junior.

167
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,220
Now, finally.

168
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,220
Please use AI as a upskilling tool.

169
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,380
Learn new techniques and programming
patterns from AI suggestions, but do

170
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,510
not blindly accept them because there
is an idea of HA hallucination in ai.

171
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,670
So make sure you actually
verify and understand the

172
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,680
whatever AI is talking about.

173
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,660
I personally believe that.

174
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:36,625
These new innovative tools that we
are using on a daily basis, they

175
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:41,635
actually affect our feeling and
impression toward our day-to-day job.

176
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:47,605
So on positive side, AI
removes the tedious fork and

177
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:49,615
tasks and prevent burnout.

178
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,455
That's great.

179
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:56,440
But on the negative side, too much
reliance on AI can, it would lead to

180
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,800
disengagement in a way or boredom or.

181
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,890
Job insecurity.

182
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,660
So it is important to have that
nice balance and, continuously work

183
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,960
on yourself as an individual and
learn the creative thinking and

184
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,820
let the AI do the tedious stuff.

185
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,675
So I. To keep ourself engaged.

186
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:24,495
I believe we need to keep the
work, challenging and meaningful.

187
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:29,105
And, other day I told my colleague if
we need to find a meaning in our work.

188
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:33,485
So we cannot just blindly create
a, I'm just giving an example,

189
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:39,485
API endpoint or a new button in
front end or new AI model version.

190
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:44,195
No, we need to find a meaning and
the why behind of every decision.

191
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:51,395
Now encouraging ownership is another
point where AI outputs are drafts

192
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:56,975
that developers need to refine rather
than accept them straight away.

193
00:13:56,975 --> 00:14:01,385
So it would keep the
developers in control.

194
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:07,865
And lastly, a growth mindset
helps developers see AI as a tool

195
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:10,055
for learning, not as a thread.

196
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:15,965
Think of AI as a, your teacher
where it's available, right?

197
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:21,085
You write and it text backs, instantly,
but you wouldn't want your supervisor

198
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,365
or teacher to do the job for you.

199
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,260
So you need to understand the
concepts and, go deeper the why

200
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,590
and hows of the, technology.

201
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,550
Rather than just use it as a
pilot to ensure developers stay

202
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,020
competitive in AI driven world,
companies must actively invest in

203
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,480
upskilling and reskilling programs.

204
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,310
Major tech companies have already
taken steps to address this.

205
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:53,945
Amazon, for example, launched a 1.2
billion upskilling 2025 initiative aimed

206
00:14:53,945 --> 00:15:00,665
at retaining a workforce in software
engineering, ai, and cloud computing.

207
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:06,135
At and t has committed 1 billion,
to its feature ready retaining

208
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:12,255
program, which provides, training
in ai, data science and software

209
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:13,965
engineering and software development.

210
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:19,395
Many companies, including IBM,
Google, Microsoft, have also

211
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:26,025
established AI development, ensuring
workforce remains skilled and

212
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:28,395
adaptable as technology evolves.

213
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:33,500
In this non-technical session, we have
explored the negative impacts of ai.

214
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,790
It is very important.

215
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,540
you are not a software engineer.

216
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,700
Even if you are not a
technical individual.

217
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,080
It is very important to
balance out your AI usage.

218
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,930
Use AI for efficiency purposes.

219
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,275
I. But continue practicing
your core skills.

220
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,265
It can be coding.

221
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:52,765
It can be accounting.

222
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,795
no literature writing a poem.

223
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:56,755
I don't know.

224
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,745
Make sure that you do
practice your key skills.

225
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:05,035
Number two is it is very
important to learn continuously.

226
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:10,585
Always encourage yourself for new
projects, for new ideas and challenges.

227
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:13,780
Another point would be
psychological engagement.

228
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:14,980
Now.

229
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,500
Keep work meaningful and challenging.

230
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,430
just for the sake of it.

231
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:25,710
Find meaning and challenge itself, and
then start working on why and then how.

232
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,320
And lastly, for business owners,
they should invest in, upskilling

233
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,540
and reskilling programs.

234
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,540
It is very important to make the
non-technical and technical staff aware

235
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,750
of AI and the impacts that it is bringing.

236
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,090
So this is the, understanding that
I have in terms of the impact of ai.

237
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,210
And if you have any
questions, just let me know.

238
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
Thank you very much.

239
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,720
have a great and wonderful day.
