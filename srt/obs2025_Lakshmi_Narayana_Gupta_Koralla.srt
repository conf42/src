1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
Hello, very good morning.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,339
This is LaMi gta and I'm working in a
Starbucks as a senior data engineer.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,080
So I have a total like 14 years
of experience in IT industry.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,069
So today we are going to talk
about DataOps accelerating

5
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:18,549
digital transformation through
data centric methodologist.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,080
Okay here, the evolving software
development landscape organizations

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,400
are increasingly recognizing data
as a strategic asset rather than

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,529
mely an operational byproduct.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,550
This paradigm shift has a new
methodologies that bridge the

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,959
traditional gap between data management
and application development process.

11
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:42,919
The emergence of data oriented
application development represents a

12
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:47,259
significant achievement significant
advancement in this direction.

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,839
Offering a comprehensive framework that
integrates data engineering principles

14
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,449
with software dev development practices.

15
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,529
As it's occurred, DataOps extends the
collaborative principles of Dev DevOps

16
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,489
to encompass data centric operations.

17
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:09,304
Creating cohesive ecosystem where
data pipelines are treated with

18
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:14,014
the Swm reader on automation
as a code deployment pipelines.

19
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:18,884
Okay, this methodology encompasses
automated data pipeline construction

20
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:24,524
continues integration and deployment for
data workflows, robust data governance

21
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:29,145
frameworks, cross-functional collaboration
and comprehensive monitoring systems.

22
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:34,024
The significance of DataOps
lies in its ability to address

23
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:37,985
several persistence challenges in
modern application development.

24
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:44,214
The need for the high quality data
delivered at speed, alignment between

25
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:48,505
technical and business stakeholders,
and the increasing complexity of

26
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,425
data ecosystems, cloud environment.

27
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:56,814
As organizations prioritize data driven
decision making, adopting data ops

28
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:01,585
has transitioned from competitive to
advanced to your business necessity.

29
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:06,895
This examinees that theoretical
foundations implementation strategies

30
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,904
and measurable outcomes of data.

31
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:15,295
Data DataOps methodologies across Val
various organization context by analyzing

32
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:18,865
both technical and organizational
dimensions of data ops adoption.

33
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:23,545
This study seeks to provide a
comprehensive understanding of best

34
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:29,695
practices, common challenges, and future
directions in this rapidly evolving field.

35
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:30,465
Okay.

36
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,025
The next one, evaluation of tra.

37
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:36,685
So the here the traditional data
management, the violation from the

38
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:42,715
traditional data management practices
to dev data ops follows a trajectory

39
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,695
parallel to software development.

40
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:50,935
From waterfall methodologies to Agile
and DevOps approaches, the traditional

41
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:55,405
data management relied heavily on
centralized data warehousing with

42
00:02:55,405 --> 00:03:00,205
the rigid extract, transformation and
load, which is called ETL processes,

43
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:04,435
creating significant bottlenecks
between data generation utilization.

44
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:09,225
These legacy approaches predominant
through through the early two

45
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,325
thousands were characterized by.

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,910
Siloed teams, manual handoffs,
and the lengthy development cycles

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,920
that could span months or even
years for complex data initiatives.

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,941
Next, the big data era, the big data era.

49
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:30,741
So the exponential exponential growth
in data volume, ity and velocity

50
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:36,411
brought about by digital transformation
initiatives expose the limitations

51
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,091
of these conventional approaches.

52
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:42,966
The emergence of big data technologies
in the mid 22 thousands provided

53
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:47,916
new technical capabilities, but
simultaneously introduced additional

54
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,835
complexity in data pipelines.

55
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,285
Next DevOps revolution.

56
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:56,666
And organizations struggled
to derive timely insights from

57
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,946
their expanding data assets.

58
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:03,566
A new paradigm became necessarily
to accommodate both the technical

59
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:07,766
requirements of modern data
architectures and the business

60
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,736
need for rapid it value delivery.

61
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:13,926
So the next the data ops emergence.

62
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:18,376
The data organically around to 2015.

63
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:23,716
As practitioners begin applying lessons
from software engineering representative,

64
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:29,506
technological shift and fundamental
rethinking of how data teams operate,

65
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,906
collaborate, and deliver value.

66
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,836
So according to the recent industry
research industry, research

67
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:40,216
organizations is implementing
data ops methodologies have.

68
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:46,771
Reported up to 70% reduction in data
deliveries and data related defects.

69
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:53,341
This marked improvement and efficiency
and quality underscores the transform made

70
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:58,741
two potential of data ops in contemporary
software engineering practices.

71
00:04:59,241 --> 00:04:59,531
Next.

72
00:04:59,536 --> 00:04:59,896
Next.

73
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:02,956
So what are the fundamental
principles of data ops?

74
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:06,921
One the conceptual framework of data
ops is built upon several foundation

75
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:12,836
principles that collectively enable enable
efficient, reliable data operations.

76
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:16,496
So here the first one is
automation and orchestration.

77
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:23,696
So data ops data ops emphasis automating
repetitive task across the data lifecycle,

78
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:28,796
including acquisition transformation,
extends the, extends to orchestration.

79
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:33,281
Coordinating multiple data process
and workflows to ensure proper

80
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,921
sequencing and dependency management.

81
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,611
So next it's A-C-S-E-D for data.

82
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,121
So we, it's a continuous integration,
continuous delivery for data.

83
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:49,046
So similar to code focus, this currently
integrating data changes automatically

84
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:54,455
testing their validity and impact and
deploying them to production environments

85
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,855
through standardized processes.

86
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,645
Next so was control and reproducibility.

87
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,785
Reproducibility, DataOps
advocates for a version control

88
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,185
of logic and analytical models.

89
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:11,725
This worsening ensures reproducibility
the ability to recreate and recreate any

90
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,185
previous state of the data ecosystems.

91
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:19,365
Next, quality by design rather
than treating quality as an

92
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:23,895
afterthought data ops integrates
quality validation pipeline.

93
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:28,845
So implementing automation testing
and monitoring to the detect anomalies

94
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,155
before they impact downstream consumers.

95
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:35,626
So these four interconnector principles
create a fund of foundation for

96
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:40,186
efficient, reliable and scalable data
system that can quickly adopt to,

97
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:42,465
to changing business requirements.

98
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:46,540
Next it's a core components of
data data ops, architecture.

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,220
So the core components of
our core components are so

100
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,660
monitoring and observability.

101
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,881
So comprehensive monitoring extends
beyond infrastructure to encompass

102
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,870
data, core data quality, lineage
tracking, performance metrics business

103
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,030
outcome, alignment, and self-healing.

104
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:08,905
Capabilities implementation typically
involves specialized data, observability

105
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:14,545
tools, comp, complementing traditional
infrastructure monitoring, often employing

106
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:19,825
sa statistical methods to establish
standard patterns and detect anomalies.

107
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:26,155
So the advanced teams implements
observability as code, ensuring monitoring

108
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:32,125
evolves alongside data systems to maintain
visibility during architectural changes.

109
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,455
Next, it's a cross-functional
collaboration.

110
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:40,436
So DataOps requires collaboration
across traditionally separate domains.

111
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:44,825
The data mesh paradigm has emerged
as an influential model for

112
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:48,936
organizing teams around data domains
rather than technical functions.

113
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:54,726
Other effective structures include
DataOps Centers for centers of excellence.

114
00:07:55,051 --> 00:08:00,011
Data product teams and guild models
successful collaboration framework, share

115
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:05,771
clear ownership definitions, service
level agreements, documented interfaces,

116
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,411
and regular synchronization mechanisms.

117
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,771
Next data governance frameworks.

118
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,070
The modern data ops
implements governance as code.

119
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:19,666
So where the policies are codified,
version control and automatically

120
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:24,316
enforced within pipelines, the key
components includes automated metadata

121
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:29,606
management systems, policy enforcement
engines self-service government tools,

122
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,766
and the granular access controls.

123
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:36,446
So implementation follows
if federated model where.

124
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:40,226
The central T Central teams
established frameworks, while

125
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:44,546
domain teams define specific rules
relevant to their data domains.

126
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:50,126
Next, CSE integration for data workflows,
the continuous integration, continuous

127
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,316
development for data workflows adopts.

128
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,781
Software development
practices to data operations.

129
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:59,261
This integration encompasses
virtual control for the pipeline

130
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:03,491
components and automated code
correctness and data quality testing

131
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:09,051
and control deployment strategies
like blue, green, or can releases.

132
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:14,771
So the data specific CSAD pipelines
include additional impact analysis

133
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,661
and continuity testing stages.

134
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:22,841
With specialized patterns, like the
expand contract approach, enabling

135
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,711
non braking schema changes data.

136
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,611
Next, the data pipeline
automation mechanisms.

137
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:34,041
So the data pipeline automation
forms the foundation of data ops,

138
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:37,881
transforming manual processes
into streamlined workflows.

139
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:42,621
Modern implementations lowered
container radiation technologies like

140
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,621
Docker for consistent environments
and orchestration tools such as Apache

141
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:52,271
Airflow Perfect and Dragster for
defining complex workflows as a code.

142
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:56,111
So specialized tools for data
transformations like depth and stream

143
00:09:56,111 --> 00:10:00,701
processing frameworks such as Apache
Kafka, addresses, spec specific needs.

144
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:04,886
At the same time, cloud providers
offer manager services this

145
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:08,126
simplify implementation with
the prebuilt connectors and the

146
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,806
serverless execution models.

147
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:15,116
So DataOps Architecture integrates these
components into a system where data

148
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:20,376
pipelines receive the same engineering
engineering rigor as application code.

149
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:25,546
Modern implementations use the
business to simplify deployment while

150
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,576
enhancing scalability and resilience.

151
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:33,736
So the next one, the implementation
strategies and best practices.

152
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:40,366
So here the organizations must cultivate
a data driven culture with a psychological

153
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:43,246
safety that encourages experimentation.

154
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,831
The cross-functional
literacy and the clear data.

155
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:51,001
Product ownership models are essential
prerequisites for eliminating

156
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:56,461
our fund data and ensuring proper
stewardship across the data lab cycle.

157
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,741
So effective implementations
follow follow a phased approach.

158
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,931
So far there are assessment
phase, file phase, expansion

159
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,341
phase, and maturity phase.

160
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,741
So now we are talking about what is what
are the different phases involved here?

161
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:14,481
The assessment phase, the ba it kinds
like benchmark capabilities, identity

162
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:18,791
bo identify bottlenecks, established
baseline metrics, and define success

163
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:23,201
criteria aligned with the business
outcomes, and that it selects a

164
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,671
high value use case, build essential
capabilities while delivering results

165
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,281
and create proof points for stakeholders.

166
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,221
And the next expansion phase.

167
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,601
So in the, in this expansion phase, we
extend implementation across priority

168
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:41,811
data domains, develop repeatable playbooks
and the next it's a maturity phase.

169
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:46,491
So establish continuous improvement
processes, benchmark against industry

170
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:50,571
strands, and maintain alignment
with the strategic objectives.

171
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:55,161
So the successful data ops
requires executive sponsorship as

172
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:59,151
a strategic business initiative,
not just a technical project.

173
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,551
It's not it's not just technical project.

174
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,561
Cultivate a data-driven culture
where, and with a clear data, product

175
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,841
ownership and accountability frameworks.

176
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,941
So the organization frequently
encounter challenges with legacy system

177
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:18,581
integration, skill gaps, go governance
concerns and cultural resistance.

178
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,581
The successful implementation addresses
these these, the abstraction layers

179
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:28,291
for legacy systems, cross training
programs, automated compliance checks

180
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:33,206
and change management initiatives,
emphasizing education and early wins.

181
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:37,401
S the next one is some
measuring data ops success.

182
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:41,181
So the measuring there, how we
can measure the data ops success

183
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:42,351
in the four different elements.

184
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,841
It's a pipeline performance,
data quality, and time to

185
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,801
insight and research utilization.

186
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:52,031
So we have a there is 65% improvement
in build success rates and deployment

187
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:55,781
frequency through automated workflows
and continuous integration processes.

188
00:12:56,696 --> 00:13:01,016
So the data quality, so we are like
on our like 48% enhancements in

189
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:05,966
data completeness, accuracy, and the
consistency through systematic validation

190
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,496
protocols and automated testing.

191
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:10,027
So the time to instance insight.

192
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:16,016
There is a 70% reduction in analytical
cycle times, dramatically accelerating

193
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:20,816
decision velocity and the builder
responsiveness to emerging opportunities

194
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,886
and the resource utilization.

195
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:27,691
So there is like 42% improvement
in infrastructure efficiency

196
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:32,281
and cost optimization through
intelligent workload management

197
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,531
and cloud resource optimization.

198
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:35,561
Yeah.

199
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,701
Measuring the DataOps success requires a
multi-dimensional approach is balancing

200
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,801
technical metrics and business outcomes.

201
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:47,561
The DataOps maturity model provides
the structured framework for evaluating

202
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:52,871
capabilities across six dimensions from ad
hoc level one, two, optimize level five.

203
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:56,786
Next economic implementation
imp implications of data ops.

204
00:13:57,286 --> 00:14:01,661
DataOps requires that capture
direct financial impacts and

205
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,381
a bro broader value creation.

206
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:06,921
So these frameworks analyze
implementation, operational,

207
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,401
and transition cost against
the structured benefit taxonomy

208
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,321
beyond simple ROA calculation.

209
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:19,061
Leading organizations employ sophisticated
economic models including net present

210
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,551
value analysis and real options valuation.

211
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:26,596
To accurately capture the full economic
impact of data ops initiatives.

212
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:31,646
So the data ops in data ops enhance
operational efficiency through process

213
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:36,426
automation, which is which which can
reducing manual effort by 40 to 60%

214
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:39,096
for routine task and error detection.

215
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:42,616
Which is following the shift
left principle to minimize

216
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,766
the costly remediation cost.

217
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:44,976
Sorry.

218
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:47,241
Next it's resource
utilization optimization.

219
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:52,031
So particularly in cloud environments
and reduced overhead coordination,

220
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:56,861
so it is decreasing of meetings and
status communications by up to 30%

221
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:59,321
through transparent automated tracking.

222
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:05,471
The global data ops market says was
valued at approximately $2.1 billion

223
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:12,181
in 2023, and is projected to reach 10.5
billion billion dollars by 20 20, 20 30.

224
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,651
So the long-term sustainability
derives from self self-reinforcing

225
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:20,551
improvement cycles rather
than one time efficiency gain.

226
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,271
Critical aspects includes technical
depth management, which is systematically

227
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:30,171
addressed, suboptimal suboptimal
solutions, knowledge preservation,

228
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,071
which is reducing organizational
dependence on specific individuals

229
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,751
and economic adaptability, rapidly
adjusting to changing business

230
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,671
requirements and market conditions.

231
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,511
Next DataOps Emerging Technologies.

232
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,481
Here the integration with artificial
inte intelligence, integration

233
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,301
with artificial intelligence
and machine learning workflows.

234
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,101
So the convergence of DataOps
and a ML workflows has led to

235
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,991
integrated practices often terms.

236
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:01,881
AA Ops or M ML enabled data ops.

237
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:07,281
The key integration points include future
store, that pro detection capabilities

238
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:11,901
that identify when explainability
frameworks that trace predictions through

239
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,411
models to underlying data transformations.

240
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,451
Next edge computing.

241
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:22,191
So the edge computing introduces
unique data ops challenges

242
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,081
requiring specialized approaches.

243
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:29,161
These include efficient data filtering
and aggregation, inter intermittent

244
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:33,061
connectivity management through
store and forward architectures and

245
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:39,601
model deployment mechanisms that can
package and verify AI ML models across

246
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,091
heterogeneous edge developments.

247
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:46,401
Time next, the real time data
processing challenges and solutions.

248
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:51,891
The realtime pro processing requirements
have driven significant innovation

249
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:55,911
in the DataOps methodologies, stream
processing architectures using

250
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:01,661
technologies like Apache Kafka, and Flink
Flinger from the foundation, typically

251
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:04,601
employing Lambda or Kapa patterns.

252
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:10,211
Advanced implementations addresses
state management challenges

253
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,281
through distributed state stores.

254
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:16,811
Implement sophisticated back
pressure handling and employ

255
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:21,391
specialized testing methodologies
like chios engineering and next.

256
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:25,951
So the impact of cloud native
architectures, the cloud native

257
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:31,021
architectures has transformed data data
ops implementation patterns, shifting

258
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:35,851
focus from infrastructure management
to service composition, serverless

259
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:41,061
computing, and, containerization provide
consistent execution environments

260
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:47,171
while infrastructure as code has as
code has become standard practice.

261
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,851
So the multi-cloud strategies introduce
additional complexity address through

262
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:56,651
meta data driven architectures that
separate logical data flows from

263
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,976
physical implementational details.

264
00:17:59,476 --> 00:17:59,806
Okay.

265
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:01,726
And then next, next slide.

266
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,846
So the ethical and
regulatory consideration.

267
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:08,826
So here, the first one is the
data privacy implications.

268
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:13,926
So the data ops practices directly
impact privacy production capabilities.

269
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:18,576
Privacy by design, by, by design
principles increasingly influence

270
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:23,266
implementations with requirements like
data minimization data minimization.

271
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,916
And integrated directly into
pipeline specifications.

272
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:31,626
Advanced techno techniques including
dynamic data masking and home

273
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:36,386
homomorphic encryption have become
standard components in privacy.

274
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,996
Conscious tool chains.

275
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:43,156
The modern consent management tracks
permissions as metadata following long

276
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:48,671
set personal data while jurisdictional
routing capabilities dynamically apply.

277
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:53,636
Different processing rules based
on data, subject, location,

278
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,226
and applicable regulation.

279
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:58,236
Next regulatory complaints.

280
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:02,606
The effective strategies employ
unified frameworks, addressing common

281
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:06,686
principles while handling jurisdiction
specific requirements Through

282
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:11,846
configurable rules, organizations
implement geo-fencing capabilities to

283
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:14,246
enforce data residency requirements.

284
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:19,241
Automated lifecycle controls for
consistent retention management and

285
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:24,021
the comprehensive lineage tracking
that documents each transformation

286
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:28,171
and access to reg regulated data
and next ethical processing.

287
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,521
So the ethical consideration have
gained prominence as organization

288
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:37,606
recognized the potential for unintended
consequences from automated systems.

289
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:38,801
Bias.

290
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:42,491
Direct bias detection and mitigation
capabilities are increasingly

291
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:47,941
incorporated into pipelines with fairness,
metrics, integrated data integrated

292
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,681
into data quality frameworks so that
transparency mechanisms have evolved

293
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:56,671
beyond the technical documentation
to include accessible explanations

294
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:59,761
for different stakeholders While.

295
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,111
Continuous ethic.

296
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:06,321
Ethics monitoring systems compare current
processing behavior against baseline

297
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,661
parameters to detect ethical drift.

298
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:10,821
Next, accountability.

299
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:15,371
So it extends beyond specific regulatory
concerns to broader governance

300
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,861
objectives impact AXA assessments.

301
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:21,421
Frameworks were increasingly
integrated into workflows, particularly

302
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,191
for high risk applications.

303
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:29,171
Organizations implement human in the loop
checkpoints through orchestrated approval

304
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:34,381
workflows, documentation automation to
maintain accurate operational records

305
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:40,651
and vendor assessment controls that
provide consistent governance across the

306
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:43,081
entire data supply system supply chain.

307
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:43,851
Okay.

308
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:47,171
The next one, real world
applications of data DataOps.

309
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:52,111
So there are plenty of services using
the DataOps DataOps applications.

310
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:55,091
The first one we can talk
about financial services.

311
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:00,016
The organizations on undergoing
digital transformations have lowered

312
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:05,561
DataOps to modernize legacy systems
while maintaining business continuity.

313
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:10,406
Financial solutions like JP Morgan
Chase have implemented data ops to

314
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:16,376
consolidate disparate data sources,
enabling realtime fraud detection

315
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:21,456
and the personalized customer
experiences while meeting while meeting

316
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,886
string and regulatory requirements.

317
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:26,556
And the next field, it's healthcare.

318
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:31,776
The healthcare provides have adopted
data ops to improve pa PA patient

319
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,966
outcomes and operational efficiency.

320
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:39,416
Mayo Clinic's implementation integrated
clinical, operational and financial

321
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:44,496
data streams to enable predictive
analytics for patient admissions,

322
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:48,186
resource allocation and treatment
effectiveness while maintaining

323
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:53,746
H-I-P-A-A compliance through automated
governance tools governance controls.

324
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,456
Next its manufacturing, so
manufacturing companies have deployed

325
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,586
data ops production processes.

326
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:03,616
Process through throughout
iot integration.

327
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:09,156
Simons uses DataOps methodologies to
process sensor data from production

328
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:13,326
environment, enabling predictive
maintenance that has reduced downtime

329
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:19,086
by 30% while improving product quality
through real time process adjustments.

330
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:24,656
Okay, and the next, next we can talk about
what is the future directions of data ops.

331
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,951
So the evolving methodology.

332
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:30,961
Next, the first one, like the
evolving methodologies, the emerging

333
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:35,521
trends, reshaping DataOps include
declarative pipeline specification

334
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:41,071
approaches that define desired outcomes
rather than specific steps and the

335
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:46,411
contracts that co codify expectations
between producers and con consumers.

336
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:50,341
Self-healing pipelines with
automated remediation capabilities.

337
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:51,981
And democratization.

338
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:56,516
Democratization of DataOps through
low code and no code platforms that

339
00:22:56,516 --> 00:23:00,656
make development accessibilities
to non specialized specialists.

340
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:03,686
The technical disruption,
several technologies show

341
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,776
potential for significant
disruption to current practices.

342
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:11,036
The knowledge graphs and the semantic
technologies are gaining adoption

343
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:13,076
for complex integration scenario.

344
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:18,621
Quantum computing presence possibilities
for the specific processing challenges.

345
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:23,571
Synthetic data technologies are
advancing for privacy, pre preserving

346
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:28,921
development, and anonymous systems
provided by powered by Reinforcement

347
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:34,331
Learning, learning show promise for
self-optimizing data, infrastructures.

348
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:38,721
Next, integration with
the other disciplines.

349
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:43,431
The DevOps will likely see deeper
integration with MOPS and DevOps

350
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:49,061
DevOps, creating unified frameworks
and spanning spanning the entire

351
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:54,396
digital value chain and expect
extending beyond enterprise boundaries.

352
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,716
So finally, I conclude that the data
ops represents a transfer May two

353
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:02,356
paraic shift in how organization.

354
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:09,241
Conceptualize, implement and manage their
data ecosystems by integrating software

355
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:14,371
engineering principles with the data
management practices, data practices,

356
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:21,391
data ops addresses, addresses the critical
challenges of data velocity, quality and

357
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:26,551
governance that have historically limited
the business value of data initiatives.

358
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:31,981
Mature DataOps implementations deliver
benefits across multiple dimensions.

359
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,991
Which are like technical gains via
reduce it cycle times and improve

360
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:41,091
quality economic advantages through
optimize resource allocation and cost

361
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:45,771
reduction and the strategic value
creation through enhanced organization

362
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,831
agility and innovation capacity.

363
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:52,536
The future evaluation of DataOps
will like likely see deeper

364
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:56,226
integration with adjacent
disciplines like ML ops and DevOps.

365
00:24:56,726 --> 00:25:01,276
Increase autonomy autonomy through
AI powered self optimization and

366
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:08,206
expanded scope to en income encompas
cross organization data ecosystems for

367
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,776
organizations committed to becoming.

368
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:16,611
Truly data driven and data ops
provides not just a framework for

369
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:22,131
transforming data from passive asset
into a active driver of business value.

370
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,341
So that's how I brought the data ops.

371
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:27,101
Thanks for giving opportunity,
and if you have any questions,

372
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:27,941
please reach out to me.

373
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:28,451
Thank you.

374
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,171
Have a good day.
