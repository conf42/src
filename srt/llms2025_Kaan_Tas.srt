1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,100
My name is Kata, and today I'm excited to
talk about something that can radically

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,960
improve how we manage operational cost in
urban mobility and logistics, AI power.

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,555
Pricing for street-based tasks.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,765
If you're dealing with task-based
operations, whether it's fleet

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,275
deployment logistics, or on demand
workforce management, you already

7
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,995
know that strategic and strategic
pricing models don't work efficiently.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:27,585
They lead to cost inflation, poor
task distribution, and inefficiencies.

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:32,625
Over the next 10 minutes, we'll
walk you through how AI can solve

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,465
this problem using real time data
to dynamically adjust pricing,

11
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,655
improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

12
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:44,455
Before we dive into AI powered pricing,
let me briefly introduce myself and share

13
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:46,405
how I ended up working in this space.

14
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:50,215
I actually started my career in
construction industry working

15
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:53,305
at mr, which is one of the
biggest developers in the world.

16
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:58,045
I was a structured, it was a structured,
process driven industry, but I was drawn

17
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:02,065
to something different, fast paced, high
growth businesses that led me to move to

18
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,315
London where I transitioned into startups.

19
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:08,515
And I initially joined Oya, which
is a SoftBank backed hospitality

20
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,755
company known for its aggressive
growth strategy across the globe.

21
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,575
It was an intense high speed environment.

22
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:20,005
I learned a lot about scaling operations
quickly after Covid, I piloted.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,390
Back into Property Invest, investing
industry in the uk joining Brick

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,940
Lane, which is a company that is
using AI power decision making to make

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,350
property investment decisions within
the UK and optimize these decisions.

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,940
This was where I developed my
understanding of AI in business

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,705
strategy and how it can be leveraged.

28
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,640
Finally I joined Lyme where
I'm now the general manager.

29
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,800
I oversee operations, one of the lar
world's largest micro mobility markets.

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,760
One of our biggest challenge
today is ensuring that task-based

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,270
operations, like moving and
rebalancing bikes and scooters are.

32
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,100
Priced fairly and efficiently.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,890
This challenge isn't just unique to Lyme.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,279
It's a problem across the entire industry,
and that's why AI powered pricing is a

35
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,080
such a game changer for this problem.

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,909
Let's take a look at why pricing is
such a critical issue in micro mobility.

37
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,740
Micro mobility is one of the fastest
growing transportation sectors.

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,250
Worldwide.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,810
Cities are embracing shared mobility
because it offers affordable, convenient,

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,760
and eco-friendly alternatives to cars.

41
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,630
Governments are pushing for
sustainable transportation options,

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,620
and we are seeing cities build more
bike lanes, pedestrian forni zones,

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,600
and smart mobility infrastructure.

44
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,100
But with this growth, operational
complexity is also increasing.

45
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,480
Managing thousands of scooters
and bikes across large urban areas

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,320
is challenging and inefficiencies
in deployment, retrieval and

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,480
maintenance at significant costs.

48
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,120
So where is this industry heading next?

49
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,235
The micro mobility industry is
projected to grow from $61.5

50
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:58,705
billion in 2024 to 223.6 billion.

51
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,490
By 2033.

52
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,910
That's nearly a four times
increase in less than a decade,

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
but this massive growth doesn't
automatically mean profitability.

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,140
Many micro mobility companies are
struggling with high operational

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,350
cost, pricing inefficiencies,
and logistical challenges.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,470
So what does the future of
micro mobility look like?

57
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,750
To sustain this level of growth, micro
mobility companies need to become

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,880
operationally smarter, not just bigger.

59
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,710
The industry is evolving beyond simple
vehicle sharing, into data-driven,

60
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,200
AI powered urban mobility networks,
fleet efficiency, task automation,

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,530
and dynamic pricing will be key
factors that separate successful

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,255
companies from that fo that fail.

63
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,550
But how do we actually achieve this?

64
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,330
The answer lies in AI
driven decision making.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,220
Companies that use AI to optimize
pricing, task allocation, and fleet

66
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,440
management will outperform competitors.

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,780
But before we talk about solutions,
let's first have a look at the biggest

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,490
challenges the industry faces today.

69
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,890
There are four major challenges we
face in micro mobility industry today.

70
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,780
Number one.

71
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,390
Parking and infrastructure limitations.

72
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,310
City struggle with poorly
accommodating fleets as there's

73
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,150
simply more demand and no more
fleets than parking infrastructure,

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,010
and that needs to be improved.

75
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,070
Number two, fleet and rebalancing
issues vehicles pile up in low demand

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,060
areas instead of being where they
needed to be to increase the usage.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,630
So that requires incre
rebalancing the fleet.

78
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,080
To optimize where vehicles are at
the point where they need to be.

79
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,500
Three, high operational cost, manual
decision making leading to inefficiencies,

80
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,550
especially in the logistics industry
where it, which is the backbone of

81
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,539
the whole micro mobility industry at
the moment, which causes us to move

82
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,490
vehicles from one point to another place.

83
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:53,534
And last point is the pricing
strategies start static.

84
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:58,275
Pricing does not reflect real world
condition, and that needs to change

85
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:03,645
so we can actually in include the
real time data while giving prices.

86
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:08,685
One of the biggest levers that we
can pull to fix these inefficiencies

87
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,995
and easiest one solve is the pricing.

88
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,725
Pricing affects everything.

89
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,695
If it's too high, costs
inflate unnecessarily.

90
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:19,245
If it's too low tasks go
unfilfilled, because workers

91
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,955
won't take them and complete them.

92
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:25,425
Dynamic pricing is crucial because
it ensure tasks get completed

93
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,945
efficiently at the lowest possible cost.

94
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:31,125
Now let's talk about how AI pricing works,

95
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,745
that we understand why pricing
is crucial in micro mobility.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,800
We are taking a deeper look about how
we are using AI in pricing and how we

97
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,010
are solving the problems that we are
facing in terms of pricing in micro,

98
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,080
multi industry traditional pricing
models assume that every task is equal,

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,555
but in reality, not all tasks have
the same complexity, urgency, or cost.

100
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,495
For example, moving an e scooter
two blocks away in low traffic

101
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:00,665
area should not cost the same as
retrieving a broken scooter from a high

102
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,525
congestion, high demand city center.

103
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:07,115
A rush hours there is, this is
where we are using and leveraging

104
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,585
AI powered pricing, and we are.

105
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:14,455
Getting into play, AI uses real-time
data to analyze demand fluctuations,

106
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:19,275
worker availability, and geographic vi
variables to adjust pricing dynamically

107
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,735
instead of a flat, inefficient price.

108
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:26,805
AI ensures that each task is priced
at its optimal rate to encourage

109
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,965
fulfillment while controlling costs.

110
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:31,665
But why doesn't fixed pricing work?

111
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:35,715
Let's explore the key flows of the
static and fixed pricing models.

112
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:39,785
Fixed pricing model has been in
the industry and has been the

113
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:43,295
standard for many years, but
there are major flaws with that.

114
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:48,865
Here's couple of four of the main
problems that we are seeing with it.

115
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,015
Number one, it ignores
real-time labor a avail.

116
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:57,295
If there are too few workers tasks pile
up and the work, the works will get into

117
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,635
delayed if there are too many workers.

118
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:03,475
And with the same pricing, we
will be paying the same price.

119
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,875
And that means we'll be overpaying
to workers for simple jobs by

120
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,405
looking at labor availability.

121
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:13,965
And similar to what Uber uses with
on the demand, comparing demand and

122
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:18,885
driver availability, excuse me, driver
and demand availability, we are able

123
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,045
to adjust the price accordingly.

124
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:25,395
So that's why it's important
to include the real time labor.

125
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:31,725
second one or least overpaying and
underpaying pricing doesn't change based

126
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:36,255
on location or demand, meaning some of
the workers reject low pay tasks while

127
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,525
others get overpaid for low effort jobs.

128
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:44,420
Going back to the example which we talked
in the previous slide, moving a scooter

129
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,525
from two blocks away versus moving
a scooter in a high congested area.

130
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,005
It's not the same job, so they need
to have a different pricing depending

131
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,235
on the situation that they're in.

132
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:56,735
Third one, first to consider task density.

133
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:01,895
Some of the areas need urgent vehicle
stri distribution, but workers have

134
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:06,245
no pricing incentivize to prioritize
these areas over these jobs.

135
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:10,355
That's one of the areas we can solve
by using AI pricing strategies.

136
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,975
Last one does not adjust for
real world demand shifts.

137
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:18,505
Mobility, demand changes based on
weather, traffic, and events, but static

138
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,395
pricing ignores all of these factors.

139
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:25,875
Clearly we need a better way to price
tasks dynamically and efficiently,

140
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,965
and this is what we are trying to
achieve, and this is where we are

141
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,095
using AI powered pricing changes.

142
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,045
AI powered pricing is designed to
adapt real world changes in real time.

143
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:40,360
Instead of setting one fixed price,
AI uses real live data, to adjust

144
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,230
pricing automatically based on a set
of key factors that is predetermined.

145
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,715
Again, think of it like Uber's
search pricing model when demand

146
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,325
is high and drivers are low.

147
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,325
Prices go up when demand
is low, prices are down.

148
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,865
The same princip applies
and the prices go up.

149
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:59,775
And the same thing happens in
the micro mobility task pricing.

150
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:04,575
But how exactly does AI determine
the right price for each task?

151
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,875
Let's take a look at the
key inputs AI considers.

152
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,795
AI pricing models don't just
make random adjustments.

153
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,755
They analyze multiple real-time factors
to calculate the most efficient price.

154
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:20,375
These include task density, how many
tasks that exist in a given area.

155
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:24,215
If there's a backlog, AI increases
payouts to attract workers.

156
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,310
Worker availability if
there are too few workers.

157
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,810
AI raises task prices to balance
supply and demand time sensitivity.

158
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,580
Urgent tasks, example, retrieving the
scooter from no parking zone are priced

159
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,840
at a higher priced to ensure fast
completion, environmental conditions.

160
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,510
AI are adjust pricing based on
weather, traffic, and city events

161
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,980
that affect the operational costs.

162
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,080
By combining all of these data points,
AI pricing ensures that every task is

163
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,120
priced at optimal level balance, optimal
level to balance, cost, and efficiency.

164
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,780
Now let's look at, let's
explore how the system actually

165
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,520
improves operational efficiency.

166
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,360
Number one, optimizes labor costs.

167
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,770
AI prevents unnecessary spending
while ensuring tasks are completed.

168
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,950
Number two, balances, demand and supply.

169
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,650
AI raises prices in underserved areas and
reduces them where work availability side.

170
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,965
Number three, incentivizes urgent tasks.

171
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:26,805
Critical jobs get higher payouts
to ensure quicker fulfillment.

172
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:30,195
Number four, eliminates
pricing inefficiencies.

173
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:34,065
No more overpaying for simple task
or underpaying for complex ones.

174
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,915
Last one, scales with business growth ai.

175
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:41,975
Pricing adapts automatically as fleet
size expands or changes or decreases.

176
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:46,635
instead of manually adjusting and
manually setting prices, AI automates

177
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:51,645
the process to keep costs low while
improving task completion rate and times.

178
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:55,775
let's break down the AI pricing
model and how it actually works.

179
00:10:56,275 --> 00:11:00,955
AI pricing model follows a structure four
step process to continue optimize pricing.

180
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:02,995
Decision number one is data collection.

181
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,225
As you can imagine, AI aggregates
real time task worker and

182
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,995
citywide data collects them.

183
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:14,135
number two, predictive analysis
machine learning algorithms forecast

184
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,085
upcoming demand fluctuations.

185
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,625
Number three, dynamic adjustments.

186
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:23,185
AI updates pricing automatically in
real time based on the predictions.

187
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,555
Number four, continuous learning.

188
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:30,715
AI refines pricing strategies based on
historical data and performance outcomes.

189
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:35,815
The same AI driven pricing model is
being used in other industries as well.

190
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:40,735
Let's like a look at, Uber, how
Uber is using, similar strategies.

191
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,775
As Uber is one of the most
well-known examples of AI

192
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,185
powered pricing optimization.

193
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,275
Their search PRI pricing model
automatically increases right

194
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,265
prices when demand high, ensuring
the better, driver availability.

195
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:58,125
Uber uses AI to adjust first
based on realtime demand spikes

196
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,825
when rider demand is high.

197
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:04,305
Prices increased at truck
drivers, geographic hotspots.

198
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,510
Pricing adjust for airports, pickups,
stadiums, events, specific events

199
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,060
zones, weather based adjustments, bad
weather reduces drivers, so prices

200
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,260
tries to compensate, and Uber isn't the
only company using AI powered pricing.

201
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,870
Amazon also applied
dynamic pricing strategies.

202
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,780
Amazon continuously adjust product
prices based on market demand,

203
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,450
competitor pricing and inventory levels.

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,950
Their AI pricing model works
by analyzing competitor prices.

205
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,820
AI scans, competitor prices and
adjust Amazon prices accordingly.

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,860
Demand-based adjustments.

207
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
If demand for a product
rises, prices automatically

208
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,960
increase personalized pricing.

209
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,180
AI tracks customer behavior to offer
customized discounts on recommendations.

210
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,640
Now we ex explored how AI is pricing
works in different industries.

211
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,230
Let's wrap up with the key, takeaways.

212
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,710
Summarize, here's what we cover today.

213
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
Fixed pricing models are outdated.

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,570
Static pricing creates inefficiencies.

215
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,150
AI optimizes pricing based on real time
data, balancing cost and efficiency.

216
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,810
AI pricing is already used in
multiple industries, proven

217
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,180
successful in Uber and Amazon.

218
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,260
That concludes the presentation today.
