00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,400
Speaker 26: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Sapna and I'm ASAP
consultant with Ansen Young's

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,780
Technology Consulting practice.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,510
During today's talk, if you have
any questions, please feel free

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,040
to reach out to me via LinkedIn.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,575
Today's topic in discussion is
governing data som in distributed

7
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:22,285
multi-cloud machine learning systems.

8
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:27,285
As organizations scale machine
learning globally, the question is

9
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:32,145
no longer whether we can run machine
learning across clouds, but how do

10
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:37,155
we do so while staying compliant with
increasingly stick data sovereignty laws?

11
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:41,824
Multi-cloud machine learning has
fundamentally changed our how

12
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,855
organizations process and analyze data.

13
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:50,135
By leveraging mul multiple cloud
providers, companies can tap into

14
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:54,485
the best of the breed services,
improve scalability, and build

15
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:56,554
redundancy into machine learning.

16
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:02,334
This approach reduces vendor lock-ins,
strengthens disaster recovery, and

17
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:07,435
allows teams to dynamically allocate
resources based on real time demand,

18
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,705
often reducing the overall costs.

19
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:17,065
At its core, multi-cloud machine learning
enables faster innovation and greater

20
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:22,015
resilience, but that flexibility comes
with a new layer of governance complexity.

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,955
Now increase in data sovereignty
regulations the same time that

22
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,505
multi-cloud adoption is accelerating.

23
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,325
Data sovereignty
regulations are tightening.

24
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:38,175
Worldwide governments are increasingly
asserting control over where

25
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:43,515
data is stored, processed, and
assessed, especially when that

26
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:49,635
data crosses national borders for
organizations running distributed,

27
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,705
mul, machine learning workloads.

28
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:56,835
This creates real tension between
global scale and local compliance.

29
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:00,905
There are three major challenges
that consistently emerge.

30
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:08,455
First, ensuring lawful data, residency
and control across mult multiple clouds

31
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,525
is non-negotiable for compliance.

32
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:16,345
Second, organizations must
maintain full auditability of

33
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,285
data movement and processing.

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,250
In mul, in a multi-cloud
environment, tracing data lineage

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,050
can quickly become complex.

36
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,150
And third, regulatory consistency
is difficult to achieve when

37
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,740
global laws differ sometimes
significantly across regions.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,385
Let's look at some of
these different laws.

39
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,829
Several legal frameworks shape
how organizations govern data.

40
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,250
Today.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,329
The GDPR or the General Data Protection
Regulation Act mandates strict standards

42
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,880
for data privacy and protection across
the European Union, and has influenced

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,460
data governance practices worldwide.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,780
In the United States, the Cloud Act
allows law enforcement to access data

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
held by US based companies, even if that
data is stored overseas, introducing

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,220
additional cross border considerations.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,210
Meanwhile, China's cybersecurity law
enforces strong data localization and

48
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,730
cross-border transfer requirements making.

49
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:29,855
Compliance essential for
operating in that market.

50
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:36,575
Together these laws force organizations
to think carefully about where

51
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:41,945
their data lives, who can access
it, and under what legal authority.

52
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:48,700
Let's look at the legal mandates and
governance data residency mandates, direct

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,540
influence, cloud architecture decisions.

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,670
Organizations must design systems
that ensure data is stored, processed

55
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,610
within defined geographic boundaries.

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,480
Equally important are
robust access controls.

57
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,350
Limiting data access to
authorized personal only.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,320
Not only strengthens security, but
also aligns with legal and regulatory

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,335
requirements across jurisdictions.

60
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:21,045
Now, what are the key standards
for multi-cloud governance?

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,290
To operationalize compliance organizations
rely on established standards.

62
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,690
IO 2 7 0 1 8 provides guidance
for protecting personal data

63
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,310
in public cloud environments.

64
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,650
CSS STAR or the Crowd Security
Alliance Star Program offers a

65
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,960
structured framework to evaluate
and certify cloud security controls.

66
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,880
NISG 853 serves as a foundational
reference for security and privacy

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,160
controls, especially for regulated
industries and government aligned systems.

68
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,620
These standards provide a
common language for governance

69
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,960
across diverse cloud platforms.

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,080
Now what happens when organizations
lack are lacking data flow visibility?

71
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,229
The visibility gap in data flows.

72
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,809
Despite these frameworks many
organizations still lack clear

73
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:26,289
visibility into how data moves across
providers without end-to-end visibility.

74
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,029
Risks increase.

75
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,514
Whether that's unauthorized access.

76
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,739
Accidental cross-border
transfers or failed audits.

77
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,059
Visibility is a prerequisite
for effective governance.

78
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,729
Now, how do we tackle this?

79
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,579
One emerging solution is the
use of sovereign cloud zones.

80
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,519
These zones localize data storage and
processing within specific jurisdictions,

81
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,829
helping organizations meet regional
compliance requirements while still

82
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,899
benefiting from cloud scalability.

83
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,209
Sovereign cloud zones enable
global expansion without

84
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,799
sacrificing data control.

85
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,319
They also will trust with local customers
and partners by demonstrating a clear

86
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,839
commitment to regional privacy standards.

87
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:21,159
As cloud architectures mature, sovereign
cloud zones are becoming a cornerstone

88
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,709
of compliant digital infrastructure.

89
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,229
Zero trust framework.

90
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,599
Another critical frame pillar is
the zero trust data framework.

91
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,289
Zero trust assumes no implicit trust.

92
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,119
F. Every access request
is continuously verified.

93
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:45,359
This approach ensures data remains
protected throughout its lifecycle, even

94
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,699
if it moves across clouds and regions.

95
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,529
In distributed machine learning
systems, zero Trust is essential

96
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:57,509
for minimizing exposure and
enforcing least privilege access.

97
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,249
Compliance automation for
scalable go governance.

98
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:05,239
Now, manual compliance simply
doesn't scale in a multi-cloud world.

99
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,939
Automation enables real-time
monitoring of regulatory requirements

100
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,309
and immediate response to changes.

101
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,889
Automated policy enforcement ensures
consistent controls across cloud

102
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,439
providers reducing human error.

103
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:28,039
Equally important is automated audit
trail generation, providing transparent,

104
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,924
detailed records of data access
and processing that sorry, support,

105
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,594
accountability, and simplify audits.

106
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:43,994
Along with this balanced governance
ensures effective governance architectures

107
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:49,934
must align with regional regulations
while preserving operational efficiency.

108
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:55,004
At the same time, governance
frameworks must remain flexible to

109
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:59,714
support innovation, scalability, and
rapid response to regulatory change.

110
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:03,824
Compliance should enable the
business not slow it down.

111
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:10,474
Cross region machine learning governance,
cross region machine learning governance.

112
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:16,114
When machine learning pipe pipeline
span regions and provides providers,

113
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,384
governance becomes even more critical.

114
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:26,704
Organizations need unified frameworks
that manage data residency, access,

115
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:29,314
security, and compliance across.

116
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:35,934
The entire machine learning lifecycle
from training to inference, to retaining,

117
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:41,384
retraining, strong cross region
governance ensures machine learning

118
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:44,114
remains both powerful and compliant.

119
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:49,774
In closing, governing data
sovereignty in distributed multi-cloud

120
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:53,074
environments is no longer optional.

121
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:55,174
It is strategic.

122
00:08:55,674 --> 00:09:00,984
By combining legal awareness, strong
standards, sovereign architectures,

123
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:05,754
zero trust principles, and
compliance automation organizations

124
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,444
can unlock the full potential
of multi-cloud machine learning

125
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:13,344
securely, responsibly, and at scale.

126
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,164
Thank you for your time today.
