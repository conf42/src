1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,045
Quantum computing impact enterprise
data achieving how 100% of is

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:06,165
going, we are going to achieve.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,020
Okay, let me take you to the P. Okay.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,605
And then why organizations today manage
two 7.3 across interconnect systems

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,100
without quantum can have strategies,
enterprise based competi orders.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,440
So I want to explain about how quantum
technology is much more important

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,810
for today's data with of data.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,099
Before going further digging that message,
I want to think about how exactly I want

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:37,840
to tell you about the, how the data is
going to be much, much bigger with the AI

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,180
evolution and how much of the GPUs have
we able to level at the same time how the

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,040
data inside is growing bigger and bigger.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,700
Okay.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,690
The more interface are drawing the
data than many hundreds of petabytes

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,500
of the data, as I said earlier,
across various systems, traditional

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,519
computing methods struggle.

16
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:58,165
To derive value from that
much data efficiently.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,235
Quantum Computing offers a new approach
that can handle complete complexity

18
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:06,235
and volume at an annually large scale.

19
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:11,035
That being said, right now we are
talking about precis per, but every day

20
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:15,535
or every month, every year, the data
is going double, triple, so that the

21
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,515
legacy systems, we cannot manage that.

22
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,165
We cannot pull the dataset data.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,950
Issues are data evaluations.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,540
It should be done for the
quantum computing only.

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,685
The key is that embracing quantum
computing for data management can

26
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:31,005
give a company a major competitive
advantage earlier that have

27
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:31,980
seen the remarkable benefits.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,460
For example, small business
reported double their benefits

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,835
that double their investment.

30
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:40,820
For example, if they put $1 within two
weeks, they're getting $2 more than that.

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,355
It's all about, I'm talking about
a small number, hundred 80 ones.

32
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:45,975
Otherwise it's pretty big one.

33
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:46,860
Why this matters.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,390
Company's content.

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,140
Today's content, as I said earlier,
two 6.3 petabytes, enterprise

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,140
volume business integration systems,
and we are expecting 180% of data

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,300
increase and producing 24 months.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,380
Whatever you're seeing right now is
going to increase how the quantum

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,855
enhanced solutions is working right now.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,810
See the pillar, right?

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,650
How everything is changing the
quantum efficiency, the breakthrough

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,770
quantum algorithm, reducing
computational complexity and

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,540
cutting process time between 2%.

44
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,890
It's not small number price, it's
seven to a percent at the same

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,400
time, better qualities, increasing
leveraging quantum ation principles

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,440
to reduce error rates by eight 10%.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,260
If you do the same thing
with the traditional models,

48
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,250
you may not see this much.

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,990
This eight 10% is a much bigger number.

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,270
Is revolutionary engagement based
frameworks driving 99% of data

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,830
connections across enterprise systems,
military grid, quantum position,

52
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,890
cryptography, engineering, regular,
comprehensive, and data already.

53
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,790
Okay, if I go back to that again our, how
the quantum mechanism or quantum solutions

54
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,180
going to help master data solutions
here That will go back one more step.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,380
If you see here the same
thing, water, because here the

56
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,520
error actually is almost 90%.

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,750
At the same time, computational
performance increase up to 60% better

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,350
preparation time, easily reduce up to 80%.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,580
That being set.

60
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,510
Our countdown point percent
by 17 decreasing 62.4% case.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,215
That workflow that previously took.

62
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:20,085
Days now, complete center point
faster, allowing your team to focus

63
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,515
on static than the processing task.

64
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,425
With the quantum computing, you
need to spend much more time

65
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:26,805
on the ETLs and everything.

66
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:29,355
The quantum computing is
much more faster there.

67
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:32,965
You can leverage more time on the
analysis rather than the processing task.

68
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:33,895
Okay.

69
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,405
How quantum ation from better ventilation.

70
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:37,155
Okay.

71
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,845
Parallel multi analysis, the
quantum algorithm simultaneously

72
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,935
level data quality dimensions
in a single competition.

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,770
Reducing validation time by 95%.

74
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,620
Advanced neur quantum pattern detection
systems leverage quantum chase to identify

75
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,180
software coalitions and analog invisible
to conventional computing frameworks.

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,640
Increase detection rates by 87.3%.

77
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,010
Enterprise quantum ation processing
billions of records with nine 10.98%

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,765
accuracy through and base verification
protocol that maintain coherence across.

79
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,040
Distributors.

80
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,510
Everything is not a small number.

81
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,830
Everything is a much bigger number.

82
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,520
We are talking with the currently
A and GPUs, and the data is now

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,110
moved from terabyte to petabytes.

84
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,716
We are talking, everything
is petabytes right now.

85
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,630
How the conversation going
to handle the data con rate.

86
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,890
We can go with the four approaches
and in spare models, high accuracy,

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,170
central repository, and for resolution.

88
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,980
Let's talk about in inspect
models, revolutionary quantum

89
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,730
frameworks reduce cross depart
ladder conflict space percent.

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,950
Admitting traditional information silos.

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,810
Previously we used everything, the silos.

92
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,460
Now the silos concept is gone.

93
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,900
Everything is centralized.

94
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,780
That way we can do much
faster and much accurate.

95
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,950
That's what I'm going to talk.

96
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,780
Quantum coherence maintenance and 0.8% of
accuracy rates across distributed systems.

97
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,450
Even with exponentially
scaling data volumes.

98
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,710
Central pository adverse to quantum
basic systems unify enterprise data

99
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,250
through coherent shared preservation
across distribute networks.

100
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,760
Faster resolution quantum
monitoring, decrease synchronization,

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,230
issue resolution time between
0.4% near realtime metalation.

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,350
So generally, if we talk about normal
way, all about models, accuracy,

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,485
central repository and FA resolution,
even when you talk about security,

104
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:25,405
how contract computer pretty much
secure computer legacy systems,

105
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,685
it's like encryption is there.

106
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,020
A random numbers.

107
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,690
Generations are then pri to
value violation detection.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,530
It identifies 18 points and percent
of potential violations before they

109
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,050
outcome prevention is better than cure.

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,270
What we follow in general rate with the
quantum quantum data management, we can

111
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,280
do the violation detection much earlier.

112
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,170
This is a pretty much helpful, for
example, if I took a quantum how the

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,150
in is built here, the cost you can
save is 1.8 million annual savings for

114
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,610
large enterprise through complexity.

115
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,990
Continuous monitoring.

116
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,690
The monitoring will be always
continuous systems, track hundreds

117
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,250
of all parameters simultaneously,
and high ion checks all the time.

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,600
Your cost savings for eight to 7%, that
means every year if you're saving seven

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,700
to 40%, how much returns are y you have
how you can implement the same thing.

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,460
That part of the approach.

121
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,669
Quantum infrastructure establish
hardware and software requirements,

122
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,440
classical integration, quantum safe
security, and change management.

123
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,679
Always we change when something
goes wrong, happen all the time.

124
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,669
We need to go through that.

125
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,489
How the change can be implemented
in the system, it will help.

126
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:37,780
Finally, we talk about RI framework
with the quantum computing CP enhanced

127
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,109
operations, improve processing,
future proof architecture with

128
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,459
this three RI framework for sure.

129
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,849
With the marsh data, our data
management will be much easier and

130
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,764
faster with the quantum computing.

131
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:54,584
The key TKs, which we discussed
in a is competitive advantage.

132
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,014
Measurable impact action plan.

133
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:58,754
What is competitive advantage?

134
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:03,104
Quantum enhanced data strategies deliver
significant marketplace differentiation

135
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:07,454
organizations without quantum risk,
failing behind measurable impact.

136
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:11,414
Early implementers, c 1%
of RI within 24 months.

137
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:15,434
Benefits include, reduce address, improved
contingency and enhanced complaints.

138
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:16,844
How the action plan works.

139
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,969
We can begin quantum data assessment
now directly implementation,

140
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:24,509
incorporating infrastructure integration,
security and change management.

141
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,329
And with this how the quantum management
is going to help the data side with

142
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:36,309
the data is increasing much more bigger
size with all the GPUs and evolution.

143
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,239
For sure.

144
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,869
We need to, everyone should make it from
the link systems, the quantum computing.

145
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,509
It just for data management.

146
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,869
That way you can rely on the data
violations and data reconciliation,

147
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:50,234
data indicating otherwise always
your back always your behind.

148
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:55,504
But make sure quantum computing is a
real heartbreaking and game changer.

149
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:56,404
Thank you.
