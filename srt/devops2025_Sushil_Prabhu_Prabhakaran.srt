00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,020
Hi, I'm Sushil Prabhu Prabhakaran.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,800
The topic that I'm going to
talk about is military digital

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,890
transformation, cloud AI integration
and smart workflow orchestration.

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:13,740
Here we emphasize on accelerating
strategic advantage to the cutting

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,229
edge technologies and also how
we are transforming military

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,450
operations with cloud computing, AI
and smart workflow orchestration.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,469
There has been an unprecedented
improvements with respect to

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,570
the strategy capabilities.

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,004
First, there has been a 43 percent
increase in the operation efficiency.

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:37,745
Second, 67 percent increase in
respect to how quickly and faster

11
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,191
the decision making has been made.

12
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:39,924
Third, there has been 2.

13
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:44,694
5 times increase in the real
time situational awareness.

14
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:49,984
Meaning that, whenever, an actual scenario
comes with respect to the, field, how the

15
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,984
military or the defense team enacts to it.

16
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,384
And the last is the 70 percent
increase with respect to

17
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:57,364
enhanced predictive analytics.

18
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:03,434
This has been achieved through the
way the, the data has been, used

19
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:08,666
with respect to the models and the
algorithms that has come up with

20
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,145
the enhanced predictive analysis.

21
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:15,325
The next one we're talking about
is how the cloud AI integration

22
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:16,845
has enhanced data processing.

23
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:18,654
So this has two sections.

24
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:20,565
First one is the improved capabilities.

25
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:22,934
Second one is the smart workflow impact.

26
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:28,544
So when it comes to the improved
capabilities, so the advanced cloud AI

27
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:33,885
systems has delivered a very good 85
percent acceleration in respect to the

28
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,665
battlefield data processing speeds.

29
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:41,805
And, the critical mission response times
have also been slashed by criticism that

30
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:47,735
has enabled the commanders of the army
men to make faster and more informed

31
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,595
decisions in high stakes situations.

32
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:54,524
The other, we see, the other, enhanced
data processing is like what we

33
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,194
saw in the smart workflow impact.

34
00:01:56,284 --> 00:02:00,434
So through the intelligent operation
and the predictive analysis, the

35
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:03,434
military logistics and supply
chain operations have achieved.

36
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:09,304
70 percent greater efficiency, by making
sure it has used the vital resources

37
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:13,714
that has reached the frontline units
with unprecedented speed and precision.

38
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:18,434
The AI driven additional support
system, I can split into four parts,

39
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,664
more like a pyramid structure.

40
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:24,944
So the first one at the top comes as the
threat detection accuracy, which is 91%.

41
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:30,694
So the big, the systems, the AI cloud
vision systems are, structured in such

42
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:36,515
a way that, either, thread comes in,
through online or the real battlefield.

43
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:42,305
It quickly identifies and acts
accordingly and in such a way

44
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:47,545
that, the real, our of the military
team, enacts and blocks the threat.

45
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,095
So that's the, top one.

46
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:52,611
The second one is the enhanced
situational awareness, which I

47
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,595
basically, in the few slides back I was
talking about the real time situation.

48
00:02:55,955 --> 00:03:01,545
So how it quickly, enacts and then it
acts according to based on the situation.

49
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:04,015
The third one is the
faster decision making.

50
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:08,985
So, the, it enables the commander's
argument to make a quicker decision

51
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,775
and then, apply those accordingly.

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,485
The fourth one will be the
improved resource allocation.

53
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:18,055
So this one is more related
to how efficiently it uses

54
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,905
the available resources.

55
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:24,185
And this in turn reduces the,
cost, overall cost as well.

56
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:28,465
So the next one, we see
how, the integrated solution

57
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:30,585
had a real world impact.

58
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,314
First one, right, it has had a 3.

59
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:37,895
2 times, increase in the military
effectiveness, meaning, it had

60
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:42,725
an impact of cloud AI integration
overall operational capabilities.

61
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,825
Second one is 38 percent cost
reduction with respect to the resources

62
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:51,660
being used More efficiently that by
decreasing the operation cost through

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,690
the optimized resource utilization.

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,700
So there have been a lot of, case
studies, so more like successful

65
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,660
implementation across various
military branches and operations.

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,292
In the next one, we see how, it has
revolutionized the military training.

67
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:11,060
First one is the 61
percent improved readiness.

68
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,329
Thank you very much.

69
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,500
So, they do have some enhanced
personal preparedness through the

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,680
AI powered simulations, meaning
that every individual has their own

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,700
capabilities, and, how efficiently
that individual can be trained, this

72
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,580
AI powered simulation does that.

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,980
Second one is the, reduced training time.

74
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,190
So, there we have some accelerated
learning curves, which very, very

75
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,445
much focuses Only on the focus only
on the main objectives and it is more

76
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,315
personalized AI training programs as well.

77
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:47,145
The third one, realistic scenarios,
they have a lot of AI generated

78
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:52,904
simulations, that, that helps
in, battling the real situations

79
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,145
with respect to, how they battle.

80
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,935
So these AI generated
simulations play a crucial part.

81
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:00,995
this slide we're seeing
how we're strengthening the

82
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,445
cyber defense capabilities.

83
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:07,145
So 90 percent prevention rate, is
a key factor, like the, all the

84
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:11,495
air power systems have blocked
the potential security breaches.

85
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,085
next one is the 76
percent faster response.

86
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:18,785
How quickly they respond to situations
has had a tremendous impact.

87
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,795
So this has reduced incident response
times through AI driven threat analysis.

88
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,115
Next is the continuous learning.

89
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:29,555
So these AI systems have
a wall to encounter.

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,830
emerging cyber threats.

91
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,650
So they keep on learning as they
interact with their human beings.

92
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,880
So it's more like a
machine learning method.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,450
So they keep evolving.

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,595
So here we see the implementing
challenges and solutions.

95
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,765
The first one, the top thread has
always been the data security.

96
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,975
So the expectation is 99.

97
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,665
99 percent of the time to be
achieved with advanced protocols.

98
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,805
The second one is the ethical framework.

99
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:58,575
We need to make sure the AI
deployment, takes place in a more

100
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,755
ethical way for military operations
and should not be misused.

101
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,595
So that's an important track factor.

102
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,825
Third one is the integration.

103
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:13,185
So, all the AI cloud integration,
when they, integrate with the

104
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:16,655
existing medicine, it should be
seamless rather than making it tough.

105
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,425
So that's, again, a very
important challenge.

106
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,770
So the return on investment
here has been at least 4.

107
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,500
1 times, with respect to the
investment on cloud AI technologies.

108
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:31,785
And then there has been increased
capabilities with respect to

109
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:35,195
improving the strategic advantages
of modern warfare scenarios.

110
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:40,855
The next we have the cost savings,
so which has a long term reduction in

111
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:45,335
operational expenses, and then future
proofing, preparing for evolving

112
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,185
military technologies and threats.

113
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,685
So, as we all know, the future
prospects and ongoing developments

114
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:55,455
are taking place as we talk the
AI robots on the real battlefield.

115
00:06:55,735 --> 00:07:01,345
The advanced drone technologies and
many other technologies with respect

116
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:05,625
to AI cloud are being developed
and are being used as we talk.

117
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,335
So, we are basically embracing
the digital military revolution.

118
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:15,104
It has had a transformative impact
with respect to the cloud AI

119
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:18,495
integration and has been reshaping
the modern military capabilities.

120
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,410
That has been a continuous innovation
with respect to the ongoing development

121
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,330
of AI development technologies.

122
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,290
And then there has been strategic
imperative with respect to adoption

123
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,390
of crucial, that has been crucial for
maintaining inventory superiority.

124
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,410
Thank you.

125
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,830
That ends my presentation.
