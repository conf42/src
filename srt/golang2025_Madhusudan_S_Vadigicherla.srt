00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,990
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,320
firstly, I would like to thank Mark
and Mike for giving this opportunity

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,980
to present in the Con 42 Go Lang event.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,970
My topic of discussion today
is information visibility and

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,709
standardization, and the key drivers
of the supply chain, so resilience.

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:21,990
In today's volatile global business
environment, supply chain resilience

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,860
has become critical for organizational
success and sustainability.

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,299
Today in this presentation, we will
examine how collaborative approaches,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,250
particularly information sharing.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,059
And standardization to enhance
supply chain resilience.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,800
With the help of a case study,
production forecast, vis visibility,

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,610
which we have implemented in one of
our clients, consumer goods industry.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,151
We will explore how shared
information systems and.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,360
Standardized processes would
improve risk management and

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
overall supply chain performance.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,180
Also by highlighting the importance
of standardizing the calendars for

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,470
cost generation by timing, and then
establishing global visibility for

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,050
effective capacity and material planning.

19
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:09,795
Okay, let's understand the resilience
of supply chain definition, right?

20
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:14,655
The capacity of a supply chain to
anticipate withstand and rapidly recover

21
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:19,575
from disruptive events while maintaining
the business continuity and competitive

22
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,945
advantage through flexible operations.

23
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:25,045
that's where you call yourself
as a resilient supply chain.

24
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:25,975
And why is it?

25
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:27,415
Why is it important?

26
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:31,555
recent global disruptions, including
the COVID-19 pandemic, climate related

27
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:37,015
dista disasters, cyber attacks,
geopolitical conflicts, have revealed

28
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,395
significant vulnerabilities in
conventional supply chain frameworks.

29
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:44,965
What we are going through right
now today with the tariffs and

30
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:50,565
the whole Panama Canal, challenges
are so disruptive in nature that

31
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,175
the entire supply chains are not.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,410
Sustainable.

33
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,660
So it is very important and critical to
build your ecosystem in such a way that

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,910
you can have supply chain resilience.

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,340
What are the key
characteristics of supply chain?

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,020
True resilient supply chains
poses PO pro proactive risk

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,700
identification capabilities.

38
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:17,285
Robust contingency planning, diversify
supplier networks and data-driven

39
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:23,405
visibility that enable rapid
adaptation to evolving challenges.

40
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:26,244
Now let's talk about the
collaborative approaches within

41
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,534
the supply chain management.

42
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,494
active cooperation is very important.

43
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:34,504
Active co active collaboration approaches
involve coordination between different

44
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,999
entities within the supply chain network.

45
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:40,024
Emphasizing shared decision
making and no share goals.

46
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:44,824
I can give you one example where,
you have, the manufacturing plant

47
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:49,984
operating out of different country and
the distribution center is operating

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,784
out of a different country, right?

49
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:55,534
it could be like an intercompany or
intercompany network kind of supply chain.

50
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:01,474
Now, this manufacturing organization,
which is actually doing the production.

51
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:07,564
Based off of the forecast, which is
shared by the distribution center.

52
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:11,524
Now this distribution center is
generating the forecast, and once that

53
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,424
forecast is generated, it is shared
with the manufacturing organization.

54
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:22,024
However, manufacturing organization has
to procure all the required raw material

55
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:25,534
from various suppliers and eventually.

56
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,839
Reduce the product, assemble the
product, and then ship the product

57
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:33,979
out from the manufacturing facility
to the distribution facilities.

58
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,859
So it is very important that
you share your information

59
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,839
across all these partners.

60
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,679
Otherwise, you will not be able to
produce the product and at the same

61
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:49,424
time, you will not be able to fulfill
your customer orders or the demand

62
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,224
within the distribution center.

63
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,964
So it is very important.

64
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,689
For you to have information sharing
across these partners and also

65
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,819
have joint planning initiatives
with synchronized operations.

66
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,119
in a lot of industries, this is called
synchronized business planning, or

67
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,439
integrated business planning, where
you are actually sharing all these

68
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,109
information between across the systems
and also between the different layers

69
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,390
within the supply chain network, right?

70
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:19,874
What are the key benefits?

71
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:23,384
The key benefits collaboration
delivers significant advantages

72
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,854
throughout the supply chain ecosystem.

73
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:29,174
Obviously, your forecast will
be improved, you will have risk

74
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:31,754
less, reduced inventory cost.

75
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:36,534
You will be able to respond to market
changes very quickly and precisely

76
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:42,445
on time and increased overall supply
chain performance, which will yield.

77
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:46,795
Better results and which will
also improve your inventory terms

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,535
and also your profitability.

79
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:53,535
Information sharing and visibility
constitute the cornerstone of effective

80
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:58,815
supply chain collaboration by establishing
systems that provide real time or near

81
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,035
real time access to critical data.

82
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:07,040
Because this entire supply chain network
organizations can develop more informed

83
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,280
strategies and respond with agility.

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,330
To unexpected changes, market shifts
and operational disruptions, right?

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,940
Enhanced visibility across the supply
chain ecosystem reduces significantly

86
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,700
the effect optimizes the inventory
management through decreased safety

87
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,140
stock requirements, and enable
more precise resource allocation.

88
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,310
This cross-functional organizational
transparency ultimately lead to

89
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,930
improved customer service levels,
reduce operational costs, and

90
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,520
increase competitive advantage
and volatile market conditions.

91
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,100
how can you make this happen?

92
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,300
that's the final goal, but then how
can you make all this happen at a

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,210
different, strategies, at a different,
levels of the organization, right?

94
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,210
you need to make sure there
is a comprehensive visibility.

95
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,130
We can talk about one example from a
comprehensive visibility standpoint.

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,140
we know lot of times, the products
are procured from different

97
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,640
places and then they are basically
stored within a warehouse.

98
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,560
Now, there could be a situation
where the container has arrived

99
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,050
to the warehouse, but it has not.

100
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,220
Unloaded, or it is not, the inventory
is not pulled into the dock yet, right?

101
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,700
The product is available, it's
right outside of the warehouse.

102
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,950
it's not available on the shelf, right?

103
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,640
If you don't provide this information
to the customer service will not be able

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,120
to really commit to any orders, even
though the product is not on the shelf.

105
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,915
It's outside, available,
outside on the dock.

106
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:52,535
Probably you can pull that container
out and then bring the product to

107
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:56,715
the shelf maybe within 24 hours
of post-processing time, right?

108
00:06:57,045 --> 00:07:00,285
If that information is not available
to the customer service, you

109
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,785
probably will lose the business.

110
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:06,645
So it is very important to have that
comprehensive visibility, not just

111
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:10,875
comprehensive visibility, but real
time data access if customer service

112
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,495
is provided with this information.

113
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,020
Then they should be able to
really take, take that insight and

114
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,310
commit to the customers, right?

115
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,920
not just, it doesn't end there.

116
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,690
So you need to really have your data
and real time access between all the

117
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,760
partners within the supply chain network.

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,210
It could be suppliers, it
could be manufacturers, or

119
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,070
it could be distributors.

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,400
If you do that, then that enhanced
decision making capability will improve

121
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,580
and then, and you will be able to have
that increased competitive advantage

122
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,810
and then maintain sustainability and
profitability, which will in turn

123
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,270
lead to financial sustainability.

124
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,520
Now let's talk about the production
forecasting and supply chain planning.

125
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,460
Production forecasting is
very important because.

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,980
Unless your forecast is accurate,
there is no way you will be able to

127
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,990
manage your supply chain network.

128
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,270
It is very important for you to have
some kind of algorithm, some kind

129
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,020
of modeling to do demand prediction,
depending on the market needs.

130
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,110
And then eventually converting that
market prediction into a forecast at a,

131
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:31,475
at a. Skew level or at an item level,
and then that forecast getting converted

132
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,995
into your capacity planning, right?

133
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:38,015
it could be unconstrained planning
or constraint planning, but end

134
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:43,385
of the day you need to have some
kind of capacity planning to align

135
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,565
all your production capabilities.

136
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:50,985
So once you do that, then you will
be able to produce the product.

137
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,250
However, when you have to produce
your product in such a way that your

138
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,160
inventory levels are optimized, if you
just produce the product, more than

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,210
the demand, then you will have, an
increased inventory situation and your

140
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,390
inventory returns would not be manageable.

141
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,460
So you need to ensure your inventory
optimization, and you need to make

142
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,980
sure your stock levels are managed.

143
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:22,555
So that you are not having the, increased
or decreased inventory situation.

144
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:27,625
And again, this again cascades back to
the supplier management as well, right?

145
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:32,335
If your supplier is not able to give
you the product on time, you will

146
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,345
not be able to produce the product.

147
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,985
So this is more like a loop that.

148
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,250
You are actually bringing in all your
partners of the supply chain to ensure

149
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,610
your forecast is good, and then your
capacity planning is good and the

150
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,410
supplier network is managed, and then your
inventory optimization is maintained in

151
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,420
such a way that your stock levels are not
going up and stock levels are not going

152
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,580
down, and then that agility is required
to make sure you are proactive, risk

153
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,220
mitigation, and ultimately strengthening.

154
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,120
Competitive advantage in
volatile market situations.

155
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,890
Okay, now let's talk through a
case study, production forecast

156
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,420
visibility implementation.

157
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,366
So the context here is a manufacturing
enterprise was struggling, with

158
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:20,140
supply chain vulnerability and
increasing demand fluctuations and

159
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,515
persistent disruption events, right?

160
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:27,225
this is, quite natural with any
organization where you have multiple

161
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:31,065
layers of stakeholders and multiple
layers of partners within the network.

162
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:35,875
To address these challenges, the company
launched a strategic initiative to

163
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,045
strengthen its resilience through enhanced
production forecasting capabilities,

164
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:46,315
and then also share the information
within the cross network so that all

165
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,625
the stakeholders in on the network.

166
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,365
Have the visibility right?

167
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:51,925
What are the key objectives?

168
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:56,755
The key objectives are to enhance
demand production accuracy by leveraging

169
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:59,485
advanced analytics significantly.

170
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,365
Reduce procurement lead
times per business.

171
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:07,285
Critical components, establish optimal
inventory thresholds throughout

172
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:11,905
the distribution network and
cultivate exceptional supply chain

173
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,905
responsiveness and adaptability.

174
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:18,385
Obviously, these are the
key objectives, which.

175
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:25,645
Yeah, any company would like to
keep on their initiatives so that

176
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,395
the context, whatever we discussed,
can be addressed and solved.

177
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,135
The implementation leadership, right?

178
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:36,025
as a supply chain systems manager,
someone has to own this, champion

179
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:41,695
this, and then be part of that
transformation initiative, orchestrating

180
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,380
the cross-functional collaboration.

181
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,250
Securing the stakeholder commitment
and directing the technical deems to

182
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,090
develop this sophisticated forecasting
platforms and, integration systems.

183
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,980
Because you have seven, eight
partners here using different kinds

184
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,580
of systems, it is very important
for us to understand these systems

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,400
thoroughly inside out and then build
integration between these systems.

186
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,020
Otherwise you will not be able
to deliver the product what you

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,490
want to be delivered, right?

188
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,990
It is very important to have that
orchestration between all the

189
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:28,330
stakeholders and, internally have some
kind of commitment, which can become

190
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,435
more of a standardization and be
that, lighthouse for the organization.

191
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:34,205
Okay.

192
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:37,925
Let's talk through what are the key
components of this initiative, right?

193
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:44,685
I know we wanted to initiate that project,
what it takes to make that happen, right?

194
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,935
what are the key components
for this initiative?

195
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:50,295
So shared, shared visibility, right?

196
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,755
shared visibility is one component.

197
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:56,545
establishing comprehensive access
to production forecasts across

198
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:00,955
manufacturing, plants and suppliers,
creating a unified, authoritative.

199
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,005
Source of demand projections
throughout the supply chain network.

200
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:11,545
So let's double click on what I
mean by shared visibility, right?

201
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:17,995
your forecast at a distribution
center needs to be shared with the

202
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:23,625
manufacturing organization, and in turn
needs to be shared with your suppliers.

203
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:26,465
So the distribution center.

204
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,740
The manufacturing organization and
suppliers are talking one single language

205
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:42,635
and one single metric so that it is
actually shared within a skew level data

206
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:47,825
on what you wanna sell, what do you wanna
produce, and what do you wanna make Right

207
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,855
across all the layers of the supply chain.

208
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:53,775
that's shared visibility, and then
providing them access to that.

209
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:57,975
Data within your system or within
their system doesn't matter,

210
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:02,535
but end of the day, you have to
provide that visibility is what one

211
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,550
objective of the initiative, right?

212
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,460
Standardized processes, Standardized
processes is very important.

213
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,280
The organizations there, there can be
situation where the organizations have

214
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,890
multiple functions and each of these
multiple functions could be managing.

215
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,995
Multiple portfolio products.

216
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:29,955
The way you forecast a thermometer
versus the way you forecast

217
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:34,660
a, a hair dryer is not same.

218
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:43,090
thermometer is more of a, a,
an item which is depending on.

219
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,840
your, health related things, whereas
hair dryer is more of a day-to-day

220
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,970
product, which can or cannot have
stable demand depending on the type

221
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,240
of the product and the quality of
the product and price of the product.

222
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,360
however, you need to have some
kind of standardized processes in

223
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,450
your organization so that you have.

224
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,260
Same language you have, same,
calendar to ensure methodological

225
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,850
consistency across all the business
units in geographical regions.

226
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,220
Now, the third one is
the capacity planning.

227
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,150
as I said, the tooling equipment, what is
needed for manufacturing the thermometer

228
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,850
versus a hair dryer could vary, right?

229
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,430
Depending on the type of the product.

230
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,710
The capacity planning conversation also
needs to have, and then there, there has

231
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,660
to be some kind of alignment on that.

232
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,230
Capacity planning, a item
procurement, optimizing the

233
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,730
acquisition process of staff.

234
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,150
Strategically critical, high value
components is very important.

235
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,940
What it means is within your supply
chain, you probably definitely will have,

236
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,025
okay, these are my aqs, BQs, and cqs.

237
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,870
So it's like Pareto analysis.

238
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,260
where you are saying, 80% of my
revenue is coming from 20% of these

239
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,450
products, so therefore I classify
this as aqs, and then the remaining

240
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,480
are probably B skews or cqs, right?

241
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:22,500
So it is very important to figure out what
those high value components are, and at

242
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,850
the same time, what those high value co
end products are or finished goods are.

243
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:33,345
And then put together a plan with the help
of, some kind of advanced notifications

244
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,745
within, within, within the supply chain.

245
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:36,665
Okay.

246
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:40,625
Let's jump in and talk about the
processes and the challenges, what

247
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,425
we had, during the implementation.

248
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,615
So standard, I know we talked
about the standardization, right?

249
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:50,325
the standardization efforts, establishing
a unified terminology, unified

250
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:54,465
performance indicators and operational
protocols across all the business units.

251
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:58,695
As I said, the way you wanna do for a
thermometer versus the way you want to

252
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,615
do for a hair dryer could be different.

253
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:05,795
you really need to have some kind of
standardization there to define what that

254
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:11,555
unified terminology is, what that unified
calendar is, what that unified metric is,

255
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:16,655
and then ensure that the data is shared
across all levels of the business units.

256
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:21,035
So that, that's definitely one of
the critical process and also a

257
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:23,315
challenge which we had to solve.

258
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,970
The second thing is the
global integration, right?

259
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,120
as I said, there are multiple
stakeholders here, multiple partners

260
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,870
in this, overall engagement.

261
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,520
So you need to build all these
data streams so that you are doing

262
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,880
like a cohesive enterprise wide
forecasting framework, right?

263
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,860
and when you do this, you're not trying
to do like a one size fits all solution

264
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,510
here, but, but at the same time, you
need to really thoroughly understand.

265
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,080
The business use case and how you can
make it work for that product portfolio

266
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,300
and, build a cohesive enterprise,
wide, forecasting framework, which

267
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,070
has visibility across the network.

268
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:00,760
Right?

269
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,990
And the third one is, the
metrics installation, right?

270
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,980
deploying sophisticated measurement
systems to quantify the forecast

271
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,170
position is also very important.

272
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,510
End of the day, if your forecast
is not good, the success.

273
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:15,135
Of the initiative will be very bad.

274
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:20,055
So it is very important to
agree to a number to have a KPI

275
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,115
defined and not just KPI defined.

276
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:27,105
It is also very important that
your KPI is measured, right?

277
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,840
I think I. Measuring and then
reinforcement are very important.

278
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,030
Unless you do that, there is no way
you will be successful, and then

279
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,570
unless we get the best results out
of that, adoption will not be there.

280
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,480
It is very important as a, an orchestrator
or as an implementation leader to ensure

281
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,670
all these, efforts and processes and
challenges are addressed and, need to put

282
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,340
together a mitigation plan on how we can.

283
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,005
Make this happen.

284
00:18:55,005 --> 00:19:01,155
And also make sure have some kind
of reinforcement model in place so

285
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:05,115
that we can see that operational
continuity across the supply chain.

286
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:10,755
So these are some results and, performance
improvements, what we achieved, once

287
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:14,595
this implementation was done, right?

288
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:18,195
the overall equipment effectiveness
across the manufacturing.

289
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:21,675
Facilities was increased by 15%.

290
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:28,185
The reduction of the lead
time was done through 25%.

291
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:33,200
obviously there was a procurement
lead time, which was happening.

292
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,050
So when we classified and when we.

293
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:41,795
Segmented all the items saying,
okay, these hundred SKUs are a

294
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,715
items, and so on and so forth.

295
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,695
Our focus was on, which are high
volatile items, which are low

296
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:53,555
volatile items, and then which has,
more of a coefficient of variation.

297
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:58,745
When we analyzed it and when we segmented
the data, we were able to identify

298
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:01,325
all the AI items and for those items.

299
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,950
We were able to reduce the lead
time by 25%, which is a huge win.

300
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,150
Which is a big win.

301
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,220
And we had also stockout
reduction, improvement.

302
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,160
there was an increase of 30% in
the stockout, reduction, which is a

303
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,510
dramatic decline in inventory shortages
for mission critical components.

304
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,350
So you are able to, you are
able to ensure the product is.

305
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:29,215
Made and you are also able to ensure
the product is on the shelf timely.

306
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:33,355
And obviously that would, bring
down your stock out reduction.

307
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:36,325
And then the communication
also got improved by 40%,

308
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,035
which is phenomenal, right?

309
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,315
market efficiency gains and
cross-functional information

310
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:43,865
exchange, as I said, as I gave that.

311
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,165
Example of the warehouse and
the product sitting on the dock,

312
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,295
which was a very generic example.

313
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:53,485
But in this case, as we communicated
with, several stakeholders with

314
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,355
real time data, with comprehensive
data visibility, that the overall

315
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:00,625
communication improvement was phenomenal.

316
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,225
And it's 40%, which is a very huge.

317
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:07,135
When, for the organization
and for the function.

318
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:10,605
And then the, it's a
something to celebrate, as a

319
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,925
supply chain, orchestrator.

320
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:17,525
So I know we talked about, the initiative,
but why actually did we do this?

321
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:20,045
What are the implications
for supply chain resilience?

322
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:24,635
supply chain resilience will obviously
bring in enhanced visibility, real time,

323
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,035
shared visibility of demand forecast.

324
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,060
Empower stakeholders to identify
supply demand misalignments before

325
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,530
they get escalated, and then take
some troubleshooting and then have

326
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,720
some strategic risk prevention.

327
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,730
So enhanced visibility is one
implication, improved planning.

328
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,840
Precision forecasting has revolutionized,
risk management practices enabling

329
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,490
data driven resource allocation
and sophisticated scenario modeling

330
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,020
that anticipates disruptions rather
than merely responding to them.

331
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:05,370
we got to a situation where, we are having
systems which are KPI driven, right?

332
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,670
if I have to give you an example,
today in the modern world, we have

333
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:16,690
systems where you wanna say, what do
I need to do to maintain my inventory?

334
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,650
Turn of.

335
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,460
Three thirds or four thirds, right?

336
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,120
Or what do I do to make sure my
service levels are 95%, right?

337
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,120
So if that is the metric, what you want
to achieve, systems are able to tell

338
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,510
you back, this is what you need to do.

339
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,140
You need to have.

340
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,000
Product on the shelf.

341
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,115
You need to have product on the shelf
for aqs or BQs or a combination of aqs

342
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:46,980
and BQs and so on and so forth, right?

343
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:53,540
So all of these, all of this is able to
happen with the help of improved planning,

344
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,405
precision forecasting, and then it has
really revolutionized and it'll work.

345
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:03,385
Only when we enable data-driven
resource allocation and sophisticated

346
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:08,595
scenario modeling and all of that
are really helping to bring back

347
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,425
that resilience, which we discussed.

348
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,695
Not just that, the
standardization benefits, right?

349
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:20,925
when you do across regional harmonization,
instead of doing a siloed operations,

350
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:24,245
within the manufacturing organization
or within the supply chain where.

351
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:28,365
one team is not talking to another
team and then create, creating

352
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,065
that siloed operational structure.

353
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:37,455
With the help of this standardization,
it is easier to address all the

354
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:43,185
disruptions and then also optimize and
then accelerate the decision making.

355
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:46,650
I think that's the critical word
here, accelerate the decision making

356
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,500
so that your resilience is ba bring.

357
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,570
Brought back into the game, right?

358
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,100
these are some of the implications.

359
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,660
And all of these implications were solved
with the help of the project, what was

360
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,770
done in the initiative we discussed.

361
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,570
Okay.

362
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,520
Let's talk through the key takeaways here.

363
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,630
the collaborative approach, strategic
cross-functional collaboration in

364
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,380
forecast sharing drives a substantial
resilience against, through

365
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,330
synchronized decision making and
transparent, information exchange.

366
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:15,425
The value chain.

367
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:19,715
So collaboration definitely brings,
back that resilience, standardization

368
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:24,275
value, implementing harmonized, global
processes, with a calibrated, locally

369
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:29,135
adaptable creates a resilient operational
foundation that balances the consistency

370
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,355
with necessary market responsiveness.

371
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:35,825
Standardization has its own
value where you will be able to

372
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:39,215
mitigate the risk, and then also
where you will be able to support.

373
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:43,845
from a process standpoint and system
standpoint, and more of a shared service

374
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:47,565
value can be brought back with the
help of the standardization, which will

375
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:50,165
be resilient and, risk proof, right?

376
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:54,225
not just that the continuous improvement,
the supply chain resilience demands

377
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,025
are persistent evaluation, right?

378
00:24:56,025 --> 00:25:00,155
as I said, reinforcement is needed,
to keep your process intact, to

379
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,245
keep your systems intact, and then
all of that would happen with the

380
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,565
help of continuous improvement.

381
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,560
The, and then once you have the
continuous improvement, it is very

382
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,290
scalable to have some kind of systemic,
upgrades and some kind of systemic

383
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,300
assessments on a periodic basis.

384
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,990
And then also not just that
data driven refinement, right?

385
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:24,960
today when you do your segmentation,
you probably got aqs as a hundred.

386
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,350
BQs as a hundred and
Cqs as a hundred, right?

387
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,720
Tomorrow, in next three months.

388
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,590
To three years, your data
might have got changed, right?

389
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,510
So it is very important for you to
have data-driven refinement considering

390
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,640
the data at that moment, right?

391
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:47,155
so all of that continuous reinforcement
and pro active adaptation to emerging

392
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:52,045
disruptive patterns is very important
that continuous improvement is need

393
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:55,645
of our, and then not just that, the
practical application forward thinking.

394
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,730
Organizations must prioritize,
end-to-end visibilities, process

395
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,660
standardizations and, cultural
transformation as well to keep the

396
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,070
sustainable and competitive advantage in
the current, volatile market situations.

397
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,419
With this, I would like to conclude,
con for 40 twos, Golan event.

398
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:20,360
And again, this is, mother Shema.

399
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,910
It was an honor and, privilege
to present in this event.

400
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,800
And I would like to thank again,
Mike and Mark for giving this

401
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:39,440
opportunity to present in this Con
42 presented, Golan event for 2025.

402
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,370
And if there are any other
questions, happy to answer and

403
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,870
thank you for the opportunity.

404
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,040
Thank you.
