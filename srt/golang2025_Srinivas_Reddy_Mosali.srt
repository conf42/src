1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,580
thank you for joining me
today in this conference.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,150
My name is S University di
and I'm a senior consultant

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,469
systems engineer at Visa.

5
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:12,519
Today I'm going to discuss on
an important topic on how to

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,940
scale FinTech infrastructure that
never experiences the downtime.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,760
As you all know, FinTech operates in
a fast-paced, high stakes environment

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,580
where downtime is simply not an option.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,650
Even a few seconds of an unavailability
can lead to a massive financial

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,519
losses, regulatory scrutiny,
and more importantly, a dent in

11
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:34,950
customer trust on the organization.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,750
Okay.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,770
Before, we dive into the, details,
let's go over today's agenda.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,180
In this session, we will explore
best practices, technologies, and

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,810
strategies that can help us achieve
zero downtime in FinTech industries.

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,880
I. We will start by discussing the
foundations of high availability

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,320
and architecture and how it ensures
uninterrupted financial services.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,580
Then we will explore real time
scalability, strategies to

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,740
handle peak loads efficiently.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,160
we will then look at disaster
recovery mechanisms and failover

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,550
strategies to prevent downtime
during any unexpected failures.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,540
We will then go through security
compliance, which are critical

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,070
for any FinTech organization.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,770
So we will discuss how to
maintain both, without sacrificing

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,450
on speed and availability.

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,540
we will then look into the observability
and instant response, which are

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,510
crucial part of any proactive
management of infrastructure.

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,170
And we will also cover best
practices in that particular area.

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,600
Then we will explore container and cloud
strategies in managing FinTech, workloads.

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,720
And finally, we will wrap up this
discussion by, by discussing on the

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,550
maintenance strategies, that minimizes the
impact and how to achieve the overall zero

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,130
downtime as a core FinTech, objective.

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,209
Okay, so the high availability,
is a fundamental requirement

34
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,320
for FinTech companies.

35
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,289
So it ensures that financial,
services remain operational, even

36
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,719
in the face of unexpected failures.

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:09,919
So there are like two main approaches,
to achieving high availability.

38
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,584
One is to have this active setup.

39
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:16,844
And then the other one is an
active passive architecture.

40
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:23,064
So coming to an active setup, multiple
systems, like hand request simultaneously

41
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:29,124
allowing seamless failover in case of an
issue and in an active passive, setup.

42
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:34,074
One system is kept on standby, which
is more cost effective, but it may

43
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,809
introduce, a small delay during failover.

44
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:41,289
So the multi-region deployment
ensures like redundancy, or

45
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:45,099
preventing, localized failures from
affecting the service availability.

46
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,559
we can also use load balancing at
different layers, of the infrastructure

47
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:53,724
to ensure like the equal distribution
of traffic, is happening and which

48
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:57,444
will also prevent the overload
on any particular single system.

49
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:03,454
additionally, We can also configure object
storage applications, which prevents

50
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:08,864
the data loss and ensures that users can
always, access their financial information

51
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:11,414
even if there is an event of a failure.

52
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:12,544
Moving on.

53
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:16,179
So this slide, discusses the
real time scalability in FinTech.

54
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,894
particularly handles the peak loads during
high traffic events like, stock market

55
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:25,994
opening, payment processing, spikes,
which happen during your holiday season.

56
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:29,234
So to, to manage these
searches effectively.

57
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,899
AI driven, predictive, scaling can be
used to analyze, a usage pattern and

58
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:39,440
then the, and then adjust, resources
proactively before the demand peaks.

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,029
There are like two primary scaling
approaches, which access in this

60
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:43,834
particular infrastructure level.

61
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,959
One is a horizontal scaling,
which involves adding more

62
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,060
service to distribute the load.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,220
the sensors like the systems can
handle increased traffic without,

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,580
any performance degradation.

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,940
So then we have something called
a vertical scaling, which ensures

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,719
that the processing power of an
existing servers is increased.

67
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,834
this increase.

68
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,649
This increases the CPU
and the memory, resources.

69
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,069
Both these approaches are
essential for maintaining the

70
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,019
high availability and performance.

71
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,919
So additionally, we can also deploy
a serverless computing strategy,

72
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,859
which can offer, a cost-effective
solution by dynamically allocating

73
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,479
the resources based on the demand.

74
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,439
So this also eliminates
the, need for, provisioning.

75
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,340
provisioning infrastructure and this
approaches also optimizes the efficiency

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,020
and minimizes operational costs.

77
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,919
So there is another approach,
is like implementing the caching

78
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,689
mechanism, such as using a red or a
content delivery networks, which can

79
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,900
primarily improve the response times,
while reducing the backend load.

80
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,140
So these strategies help with
seamless user experiences

81
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,940
during the peak traffic hours.

82
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,250
Okay, moving on.

83
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,940
this slide focuses on the disaster
recovery and the failover mechanisms.

84
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,730
these are the crucial, for
any, for ensuring that the fin

85
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,570
FinTech systems remain resilient
against any unexpected failures.

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,430
no system is completely immune to failure.

87
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,349
So making a robust, a disaster
recovery plan is essential to minimize.

88
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:16,065
minimize the downtime and the data laws.

89
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:20,825
So one key strategy, is cross
region replication, where backup.

90
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:26,834
Are stored in multiple, geographical
locations to safeguard any, against any

91
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:29,314
regional outages and the data, corruption.

92
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:35,025
So additionally, a multi-master database
architecture, can be deployed, which

93
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:38,414
can enhance the system reliability by
allow, by allowing the seamless failover.

94
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:43,784
So in database, node failures, if
any of the database node failures.

95
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:48,834
Happen, Arthur takes over instantly
and ensuring that uninterrupted,

96
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:54,314
transaction happen for the customers
to further enhance the resiliency.

97
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,554
Chaos engineering, can be
implemented as a proactive strategy.

98
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:01,064
So this involves deliberately
like simulating the failures

99
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:04,434
in a controlled environment, to
identify any vulnerabilities before.

100
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,309
The real incident occurs.

101
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,969
So another critical, measure we
can, deploy is, or, use is to have

102
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,019
the automated, rollback pipelines.

103
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:20,809
So these, the, so this enables the quick
reversion to the system, state, in case of

104
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:25,529
failure, reducing the overall d downtime
and maintaining the business continuity.

105
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,579
Now let's go through the
security and the compliance.

106
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,219
security and compliance are
fundamental pillars of FinTech.

107
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:37,249
So where a breach can be more damaging
than the actual system downtime itself.

108
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:41,759
So while man, while maintaining the
availability is critical, I. ensuring

109
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,149
the Rob robust security measures is
equally essential to protect the financial

110
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,459
transactions and the customer data.

111
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,899
A zero trust, security, model is
like one of the key approaches

112
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,489
in modern FinTech infrastructure.

113
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,819
So operating under the
principle that no entity.

114
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:00,284
Internal or external should
be automatically trusted.

115
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:05,834
So this minimizes the overall
attacks, and enforces, continuous

116
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,604
authentication and verification.

117
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:12,064
So additionally, encryption, plays
a crucial role in, safeguarding

118
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,994
the overall sensitive financial
data, both at rest and in transit.

119
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:20,264
Ensuring, information, remains
protected against cyber threats.

120
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:23,714
So regulatory compliance
with the frameworks like,

121
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:27,934
G-D-P-R-P-C-I-D-S-S-O-C two is mandatory.

122
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,934
but meeting this requirement should
not come at the cost of performance.

123
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,964
going forward, Advanced security
solutions, must be optimized to ensure

124
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:41,014
like the regulatory adherence, while
maintaining the high speed transaction

125
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:45,424
processing to further enhance your
security posture, without showing any down

126
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,199
operations, AI driven fraud detections.

127
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,899
Is an effective way, to deploy.

128
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,320
by analyzing transaction patterns
in real time, AI can detect and

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,330
prevent fraudulent, activities,
which allows FinTech platforms

130
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,170
to protect users while ensuring,
like seamless, transaction speeds.

131
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,250
By integrating these, security
and compliance strategies,

132
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,030
FinTech of course, can maintain
a strong security posture without

133
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,250
compromising on security efficiency.

134
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,330
And of course, a user, experience.

135
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,710
Moving on to observability,
observability is a key aspect,

136
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,310
of modern FinTech infrastructure.

137
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,910
So going beyond traditional
monitoring to provide like deep

138
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,290
insights into system performance
and, potential failures unlike, any

139
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,120
conventional approaches that rely.

140
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,580
Only on reactive, troubleshooting
observability enables proactive

141
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,320
issues, detection and resolution.

142
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,550
The foundation of observability is
built on three key pillars, right?

143
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,370
you can have, logs, you have a
metrics, and you have your traces.

144
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,750
So logs will capture the real
time, system, events, metrics,

145
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,830
quantify the performance indicators.

146
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:54,215
And the trace map, traces map
out the journey of the request

147
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:55,805
across the distributed systems.

148
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:59,905
So to, so together these elements
offer a comprehensive view of

149
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:03,815
system health, making it easier
to pinpoint, any kind of issues.

150
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,355
So leveraging, ai, driven
anomaly detection techniques.

151
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:11,855
FinTech platforms can identify
performance degradations before

152
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,595
they can impact the actual users.

153
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:17,745
this also allows like teams to address
any of the concerns proactively.

154
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,475
additionally, predictive analytics can
forecast the potential infrastructure

155
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:25,925
issues, by analyzing the historical
patterns and then helping to help

156
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:31,235
to prevent the future occurrences To
further enhance the reliability, ling

157
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:35,555
mechanisms can be integrated, which
allows like the systems to automatically

158
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,260
resolve minor failures without.

159
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,115
any human interventions.

160
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:43,985
So during these, manual efforts,
speed, this reduces the manual

161
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:48,225
effort and then speeds up the,
overall, service availability.

162
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:52,565
by embracing this availability, like
FinTech companies can strengthen

163
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:56,755
their instant response strategies,
mitigate risk, before they get

164
00:09:56,755 --> 00:10:00,745
escalated, and then provide
uninterrupted services to the customers.

165
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:02,295
Okay.

166
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:06,665
Ization has a, has revolution,
revolutionized the workload

167
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:07,655
management in FinTech.

168
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:11,955
So with the, humanities imaging as,
industry standard, due to its and

169
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:17,215
parallel, scalability, resilience, and
automation, many industries are now

170
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,485
focusing on containerization as a go-to.

171
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,440
strategy.

172
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,640
So by orchestrating the containerized
applications efficiently, so Kubernetes,

173
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,440
like enables, like FinTech platforms
to handle fluctuating demands, while

174
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,080
ensuring like high availability
and security, poster is maintained.

175
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,530
a key advantage of ha
of, deploying Kubernetes.

176
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,470
it has an horizontal pod autoscaling
mechanism, which dynamically adjusts

177
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,120
the resources based on the demand.

178
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,750
this also ensures like the application
scales automatically during

179
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,440
high trans, transaction volumes.

180
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,530
such as Again, market openings or
any kind of, a holiday season, right?

181
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,790
During that time, you can, you can
enable this, HP or the horizontal

182
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,110
port auto scaling feature, that can
ba basically dynamically adjust your.

183
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,350
resources.

184
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,980
Then Kubernetes also offers
a built-in to fall tolerant

185
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,570
and self-healing capabilities.

186
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,050
So if any node, fails workloads or
the parts that are scheduled on that

187
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,620
particular node will automatically
get rescheduled to a healthy node,

188
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,700
which minimizes the downtime without
having a manual intervention.

189
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,980
additionally, you can, have a
role-based, access controls the RAC

190
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,300
policies and network policies, which
enhances the security by limiting

191
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,890
the sensitive financial data.

192
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,430
And then, and critical services
information to unauthorized

193
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,580
users, while stateful, workloads.

194
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,800
such as databases and financial
transactions, present unique challenges

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,130
in the Kubernetes, proper configuration
such as stateful sets and persistent

196
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,300
storage solutions ensures like the
stability and the reliability is

197
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,620
achieved within the environment.

198
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,000
So optimizing these Kubernetes techniques,
for FinTech use cases, organizations

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,540
can, achieve operational efficiency,
security, and like seamless scalability.

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,310
Okay.

201
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,700
Now let's discuss on maintenance
activity and the best practices.

202
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:14,245
how to use, use to minimize the overall
impact in this particular situations.

203
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:18,555
So in FinTech industry, maintaining the
system reliability, while minimizing

204
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:23,055
the impact is critical for ensuring
the seamless financial transactions,

205
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,305
regulatory compliance, and customer trust.

206
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:29,295
a proactive maintenance strategy is
important, which leverages automated

207
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,475
monitoring tools and, AI driven predict.

208
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:36,665
analytics to detect and dissolve
potential failures before they affect

209
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:40,825
the operations so teams can perform,
regular health checks, security

210
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:44,460
audits, and load testing to further
strengthen their security posture.

211
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,780
to ensure like zero, downtime
deployments, FinTech companies should

212
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,860
adopt like blue green deployments,
cannery releases and feature flagging

213
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,940
techniques, which allows, seamless updates
without even disrupting the services.

214
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,800
and then high availability
is also crucial.

215
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,290
So achieving, through multi-region
deployments, self-healing, infrastructure

216
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,500
and robust, database replication
strategies that provide like automated.

217
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,110
Automated, a failover, in
case of failures, right?

218
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,490
So this can be implemented, to make sure
like how we high availability is achieved.

219
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,480
Then, security and compliance
must be a top priority.

220
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,260
we, with continuous vulnerabilities
scanning, Automated patch management

221
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,860
and strict adherence to the industry
regulations, we can still maintain

222
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,820
that security posture, coming to
the data encryption organization.

223
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,590
further protect, which will
protect the sensitive financial

224
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,090
information from cyber threats.

225
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,850
Database schema versioning is one.

226
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,550
the 10 shows like the
backward compatibility and

227
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,040
preventing the disruptions when
database structures, change.

228
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,180
So equally important is, effective
communication and instant management.

229
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,550
So customers and stakeholders should
receive timely maintenance notifications

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,390
while, instant response frameworks such
as, SRE principles or the playbooks.

231
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,760
help teams quickly identify the, the
issue and then mitigate and learn

232
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,460
from those, system disruptions.

233
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,440
So conducting the postmortem
analysis, is very important after

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,340
your, after the instance, ensure.

235
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,955
After the incident, which ensures like
the continuous improvements and long-term

236
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:21,875
stability, by integrating these best
practices, fin FinTech can, achieve a

237
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,655
balanced approach between the continuous
innovation and system reliability,

238
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:30,125
fostering, customer confidence while
maintaining the regulatory complaints.

239
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,155
Okay, moving on to the next slide.

240
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:36,045
the goal of the overall goal of
the FinTech is to achieve, the 99

241
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,765
point, however nines, uptime, right?

242
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:44,085
So which translate to just few minutes of,
downtime by per year, downtime leads to

243
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:47,715
a financial losses regulatory ities, and
of course, decline in the customer trust.

244
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:51,825
achieving the zero downtime,
requires a holistic approach.

245
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:56,365
that includes scalable, architecture,
automated failover, security

246
00:14:56,365 --> 00:15:00,575
compliance, continuous observability
and AI driven automation.

247
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,225
So companies that prioritize
reliability have a competitive edge,

248
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:10,105
as customers and partners trust them
to, provide uninterrupted services.

249
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,705
So always make sure like
reliability should be.

250
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,105
it should not be just a technical goal.

251
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,715
It is a fundamental pillar
of a FinTech success.

252
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:22,425
Just to summarize, I think we
have, explored like strategies for

253
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:26,845
building and, resilient, FinTech
infrastructure, including scalability,

254
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:29,155
security observability and automation.

255
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,185
we have gone through a security
and compliance, posture, which

256
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:35,305
must be integrated into every
aspect of infrastructure design.

257
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,645
So finally, I want to thank everyone for
joining me in this particular session.

258
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,435
So I hope you like this session.

259
