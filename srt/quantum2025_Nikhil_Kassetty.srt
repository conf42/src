00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,230
Hello everyone and thank
you for joining today.

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:08,600
I'm Nickel Kati and I'm here today to
talk on a topic from milliseconds to

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,910
microseconds, how quantum computing
could transform real-time payments.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,340
So to start with we are.

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:20,884
A fascinating intersection
of two major revolutions.

6
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:24,095
It's more of like realtime payments
and also the quantum computing.

7
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:29,705
So in today's talk, I will talk, take
you through how the quantum computing

8
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:35,105
technology once confined almost like to
just I would say more of a theoretical.

9
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:40,474
Physics model is now beginning to
reshape one of the most critical

10
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,864
pillars of our economy and also
the financial transactions.

11
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,285
So as we move from milliseconds
to microseconds, we are

12
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:48,754
not just talking about.

13
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,315
FSA payments here.

14
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:55,025
So we are also talking about a shift
in how value is exchanged globally.

15
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:59,285
So more about like how fraud is
prevented in real time and how

16
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:03,574
banking systems are rearchitected
to operate in the quantum speeds.

17
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:09,084
So imagine like in this, billions
of transactions per second optimized

18
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,624
across global networks with fraud
detection systems that don't

19
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:15,144
just react, they also anticipate.

20
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:20,904
So the potential economic impact of
this transformation is just staggering?

21
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:24,234
I would say so, just because I'm
just seeing that based on the

22
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:26,394
studies that usually suggest this.

23
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:30,834
So the studies in the recent ones
that I've been through suggest

24
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,084
more of like around four 11.

25
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,789
Billion Global Boost, and that's
just not only the beginning.

26
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:42,429
So as part of that, in this presentation,
I'll walk you all through the core quantum

27
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:44,619
principles that makes this possible.

28
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,809
And at the same time, the real world
pilot programs that already in motion, and

29
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:54,819
also the use cases in payment processing,
fraud detection, and risk management.

30
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,859
So as we move through the next slide,
so here we are going to discuss more

31
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,880
of quantum principles, also the quantum
day or like how it is approaching

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,739
and also the global initiatives.

33
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,370
So to start with on I would say like a
quick primer on the quantum computing.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,450
It just more of not just a theory
anymore, at least for finance now.

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,680
So at its core the quantum
computing operates very differently

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
from classical machines now.

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,040
So instead of traditional bits
that are either zero or one,

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
like the quantum bets or qubits.

39
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,145
That can still exist in more of
a super position way that is both

40
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:36,215
zero and one at the same time.

41
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:37,835
So that is the difference here.

42
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:43,205
So combining this with the entanglement
and the interference, we can get a

43
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:48,365
system that can explore massive solutions
and also the spaces in parallel.

44
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,795
So what does this mean for finance?

45
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:57,005
So it means we can solve problems that are
currently in traceable or like optimizing.

46
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:59,455
I would say, global payment route.

47
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,605
So it's more of simulating
economic systems and also

48
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:04,315
detecting the fraud in real time.

49
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:09,585
So now you may have heard of QD
if not, so the QD is the moment

50
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,085
when the quantum computers.

51
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,630
Surpasses the classical
ones in commercial utility.

52
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,690
So that day is almost
approaching faster than expected.

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,610
So we are seeing a lot of breakthroughs
in error correction, stability and

54
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,080
qubit scaling from major players
like IBM, Google and D-Wave.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,970
And that's not just a thing,
it's more of not just the tech

56
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,560
chains pushing the frontier.

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,380
Even the financial institutions
are getting involved too.

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,610
So one key initiative is by the
Bank of International Settlements.

59
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,240
It's called BIS.

60
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:44,225
So working with the central
Banks of France and Germany on a

61
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,055
more of a quantum leap project.

62
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:51,045
So it's more focused on transforming
cross border settlements and also

63
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,725
more of in a monetary infrastructure.

64
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:59,145
So as we move through the next slide
here, we are going to more of talk

65
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:04,105
about the fundamentals and also
different kinds of payment systems.

66
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,455
So here this.

67
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,895
I would say here, it more likely
works as a foundation of why quantum

68
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:11,364
really matters in the payments.

69
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:17,635
So the quantum computers use qubits, which
can exist in multiple states at once.

70
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:21,385
So I would say the quantum
properties like super provision and

71
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:24,505
entanglement that we were discussing
earlier, they give the ability.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,100
To solve problems exponentially
faster than the classical mission.

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,660
So in payments, that means we can
optimize routing, detect fraud faster,

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,520
and also they handle massive transaction
volumes and it's just not theoretical.

75
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,905
The, and as I was mentioning, the Bank
of International Settlements is already

76
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:46,195
leading the real world pilots focused
on cross border quantum payments.

77
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:50,365
So these early experiments are
helping shape the quantum ready

78
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,805
infrastructure for tomorrow.

79
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:57,445
So now let's explore how this impacts
payments, speed and processing in general.

80
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:02,095
So as we move through the next
slide here, we discuss about the

81
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,925
accelerating this payment processing.

82
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,470
So this is where the quantum systems.

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,730
Start dwelling, real visible
impact, I'd say accelerating

84
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,350
payment processing end to end.

85
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,150
So traditionally payments
move in batch cycles, so often

86
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,130
delayed by processing windows.

87
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,760
Also like the settlement queues and
also the routing inefficiencies.

88
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,180
So with quantum computing, we are
looking at a more real time or

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,640
even microsecond level transaction.

90
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,885
So leap that changes how money flows.

91
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,420
Across the globe.

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,430
So through quantum enhanced routing,
payment systems can instantly evaluate

93
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,530
billions of possible paths and
select the most efficient one, and

94
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,520
also the factoring in the currency
conversion, regulatory constraints,

95
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,020
and also the network conditions.

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,270
So on a global scale, this means
the seamless optimization across

97
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,160
banks, regions, and also the digital
networks minimizes this friction

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,900
and also maximizes the speed.

99
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:07,585
So finally the impact on the
settlement speed is more prevalent now.

100
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:12,235
So I would say more important
and at the same time more, I

101
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:13,555
would say like much required.

102
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:18,805
So what currently takes hours or days
can even be reduced to milliseconds or

103
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:24,350
microseconds, dramatically improving
this liquidity, reducing risk, and

104
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,955
also the enhancing the customer
experience so the quantum doesn't

105
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,665
just makes the payments faster.

106
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,900
It also makes the entire financial
networks smarter and more

107
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,760
adaptive and also future ready.

108
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,170
So the next slide we are going
to discuss about enhanced

109
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,900
fraud and detection prevention.

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,880
As part of being feature ready is
just more of staying ahead of threat.

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,110
So quantum computing enables
an entirely new level of fraud

112
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,180
detection with quantum sorting.

113
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,340
So we can process massive financial data
sets in real time detecting anomalies,

114
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,100
patterns, and also the risk factor.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,550
Than even before.

116
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,980
And also making it faster.

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,340
So instead of waiting for
fraud to occur, the real time

118
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,650
monitoring allows us to flag.

119
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,645
Suspicious activity even before
the transaction's complete.

120
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:19,935
So this is proactive and at the
same time reactive security as well.

121
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:24,945
So then when it comes to a ML, so a ML
stands for like anti-money laundering.

122
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,345
So the quantum analytics.

123
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:33,865
Vastly improve how we identify and trace
this suspicious financial behaviors

124
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:38,905
even across the complex transaction
chains and also the hidden networks.

125
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:44,215
So with Quantum, we are no
longer limited by scale or speed.

126
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:48,655
We are entering an era where
fraud detection becomes instant

127
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,365
intelligent and also global.

128
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:55,895
So how do we see the, this transformation
can happen in the management, right?

129
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,775
So it just doesn't stop with fraud.

130
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:03,075
So Quantum's power extends
deep into financial risk

131
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,755
management, reshaping how we.

132
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,670
Assess price and predict
risk at every level.

133
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,750
And also at the top of the stack
is the portfolio optimization.

134
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,580
So the quantum systems can analyze
massive combinations of assets,

135
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,890
constraints, and also the market
variables producing optimal strategies

136
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,810
in microseconds, not just ours.

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,790
So next is the asset pricing.

138
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,370
So where the traditional model simplify
to make calculations more tractable.

139
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:32,740
But.

140
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:38,785
Quantum algorithms can incorporate far
more variables leading to the quantum

141
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,915
level precision in the valuation.

142
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,605
The next thing, what we
have is the risk assessment.

143
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:48,865
So whether I'd say like whether in
the market credit or operational risk

144
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:54,215
quantum tools allow us to simulate
uncertainty at scale, improving

145
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,565
accuracy and response time for risk
managers, and also finally, the

146
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,505
consumer analytics with behavioral data.

147
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:08,470
Exploding the quantum computing helps
us understand customer patterns and

148
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,760
the preferences in more real time,
way, powering more personalized

149
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,860
and predictive financial services.

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,305
So altogether, this is just, I. Not
like an upgrade that we are looking

151
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:23,595
at in speed, but it's more of like
a paradigm shift in how financial

152
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:27,105
institutions quantify and manage risk.

153
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,695
So the next important thing would be the
security that we are going to discuss.

154
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:35,315
So when we come to the security
aspect I would say welcome,

155
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:39,435
quantum computing opens the door to
massive financial transformations.

156
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:43,355
As we were discussing earlier, it also
introduces the security issues, what

157
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:48,875
we call the Quantum Security Paradox
at the at the heart of its encryption.

158
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:54,335
So the financial systems rely on
RSA and also the ECC cryptographic

159
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:59,945
methods so that quantum computers can
break with enough qubits and time.

160
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,965
What we really consider secure
today could become more.

161
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,605
Instantly vulnerable in
a post quantum world.

162
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:12,005
So even more concerning is the
rise of the harvest attacks.

163
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:17,105
So these involve bad actors
collecting the encrypted data with

164
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,535
the intention of decrypting it later.

165
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,545
But once the quantum capabilities
catch up, these includes these

166
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:29,435
sensitive transactions, personal
data, even inter bank communications.

167
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:33,725
That's why building a quantum
safe infrastructure is more

168
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:36,485
required and urgent, I would say.

169
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:41,475
And financial institutions need to adopt
post quantum cryptography and also the

170
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,235
algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.

171
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:51,045
So this gives a more of a beginning
of the transactions before quantum

172
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:53,085
computers reach the full maturity.

173
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:57,975
So the security aspects must
evolve parallel with innovation.

174
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:02,805
Otherwise, the very technology that
empowers finance could also expose it.

175
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:08,765
So as we see here, so when we
discuss the total adoption, how it

176
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:13,475
is right now, it looks at different
industries are trying to adopt this.

177
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,305
And also at the same time
different industries as in

178
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:17,625
like in the financial sector.

179
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:21,345
So the financial institutions which
are running experiments with the

180
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:25,315
quantum applications especially
in the payment processing and

181
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,025
also the portfolio modeling.

182
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:27,985
So these.

183
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:33,325
Pilots, help them understand performance
integration and scaling challenges.

184
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:38,365
So the payment networks are just stepping
up so that the focus will be more on

185
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:43,105
developing quantum safe protocols to
ensure future proof, encryption and

186
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:45,595
also the secure transaction flows.

187
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,715
Meanwhile.

188
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:51,625
The central banks are exploring
how quantum can enhance settlement

189
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:56,485
systems, reduce latency in clearing
process, and also improve global

190
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,005
liquidity alignment, of course.

191
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:03,285
The implementation season, just
without challenges, but qubits remain

192
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:08,505
fragile, hardware is evolving and also
the timelines are still uncertain.

193
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:12,625
But with these pilots are
planting the seeds for quantum

194
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,875
native financial infrastructure.

195
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,020
So what is the takeaway as we see here?

196
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,030
So we are more beyond curiosity.

197
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,940
We are in the more of experimentation era.

198
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,110
So and so like those who start now
will have a serious competitive edge

199
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,270
with the qu the quantum computing as
it more matures in the overall system.

200
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,040
So how do we prepare for
the quantum payment future?

201
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,040
So as we see we, it's more of,
starts with a strategic roadmap.

202
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,130
The financial institutions
are beginning to define what

203
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,780
quantum readiness looks like.

204
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,960
So from assessing the talent,
they need to identify where

205
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,000
quantum can create the most value.

206
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,060
So there's more about like
long-term capability building,

207
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,470
not just short-term pilots.

208
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,230
So next is the regulatory frameworks.

209
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,250
As with any technical shift in
finance, standards and compliance

210
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,010
must evolve and, both ways.

211
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,900
So the government, central banks, and
also the industry bodies will play

212
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,730
more critical role in shaping these
policies and setting these benchmarks.

213
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,200
And also the supporting safe innovation.

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,200
And finally, the transition
planning is the key here.

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,340
So we can't flip.

216
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,800
A switch from old to
new systems overnight.

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,690
So a phased approach, starting with
hybrid models and gradually introducing

218
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,040
post quantum cryptography is the most
practical and secure path forward.

219
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,120
So the institutions, that start
preparing today will be best

220
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,770
positioned to lead tomorrow.

221
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,890
So quantum isn't just coming,
it's like just accelerating.

222
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,535
And the financial sector also
must mask keep up with the

223
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:51,420
peace I. As we conclude here.

224
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,030
So what I would like to say is that
the timeline is pretty clear, as we

225
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,040
have discussed in the previous slide.

226
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,780
So within the next decade, the quantum
computing will transform how the

227
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,190
payments work, making them exponentially
faster, smarter, and more secure.

228
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,450
So the early adopters, those who
experiment, invest, and plan today

229
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,400
will gain a massive competitive edge.

230
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,380
These institutions won't just.

231
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,840
Keep up with the change,
they'll also help define it.

232
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,900
And most importantly, the leap
isn't just about the systems.

233
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,510
I say it's more about people,
how they can adopt to it.

234
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,080
So the customer experience
will be reimagined, the instant

235
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,370
transactions, predictive security,
the seamless cross border transfers.

236
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,270
The trust and also the
convenience at a whole new level.

237
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,300
But to get there, we definitely
need a good strategic planning now.

238
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,900
So from encryption, upgrades
to the workforce readiness from

239
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,440
policy to platform, there's
general requires foresight,

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,140
coordination, and a bold leadership.

241
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,530
So quantum isn't just a
technological evolution, it's a

242
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,570
financial revolution going forward.

243
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,510
So it's time we start looking
forward and built towards that.

244
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,570
Thank you so much for the attention
and I'm happy to answer any questions

245
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,890
and I'm happy to get connected on
LinkedIn if anyone is interested to

246
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,810
know more about how quantum computing
is really revolutionizing and how it is

247
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,950
getting really adopted in some systems.
