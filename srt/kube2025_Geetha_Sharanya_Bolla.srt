1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,919
Okay.

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:01,959
Hello all.

3
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,309
I'm Gita Ola, and I'm so hap, so happy
to be here with all of you today.

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,379
I'm a healthcare technologist specializing
in cloud native architectures and

5
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,709
interoperability solutions, and
I'm deeply passionate about using

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:18,210
technology to make healthcare more
equitable and accessible for everyone

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,540
no matter where they live, right?

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,839
So with the last few years, I've closely
worked with healthcare organizations,

9
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,279
modernizing their systems using
Kubernetes, FHIR, and microservice.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,420
Mainly bridging the gap between
technology, innovation, and

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,620
real world patient care.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,850
Today my talk is titled about
Reimagining Healthcare Access with Data

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,920
Integration and Microservices at Scale.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,240
In the next 35 minutes,
I'm going to talk with you.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,030
All about how data integration and modern
cloud architectures are transforming

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,920
healthcare, improving outcomes, and
driving efficiency, especially for

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,490
rural land underserved populations.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,530
The healthcare data crisis, the
modernization imperative, the cloud

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,550
native architecture, evolution, real
world impact stories, and finally, the

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,750
design principles that make healthcare
systems resilient and scalable.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,110
So healthcare data crisis.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,820
So when we talk about healthcare
modernization, the first thing we have

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,620
to acknowledge is the data crisis.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,180
Today in nearly 80% of critical
patient data remains siloed across

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,590
disconnected healthcare systems.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,570
That means that patient records, lab
results, and even prescription data

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,050
often live in separate databases
that don't talk to each other.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,669
So this fragmentation doesn't
just create inefficiency.

29
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:48,750
It directly impacts patient
safety, for example.

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,730
Imagine a diabetic patient who
visits a rural clinic, then a city

31
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,590
hospital, and later a specialist.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,900
If these systems can't share data,
doctors end up repeating tests, missing

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,760
critical history or delaying treatment.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,940
So this is an just a technology issue.

35
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,080
It's a human issue.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,950
When data is fragmented, care
becomes fragmented, right?

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,920
So globally, this lack of data integration
inflates operational costs and slows down

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,660
every aspect of the healthcare system.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,410
So the question becomes
how do we break this silo?

40
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,580
This brings us to the
modernization imperative.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,280
So the modernization imperative is
the healthcare systems today are under

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,470
enormous pressure to scale, integrate,
and respond faster than ever before.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,090
So we need infrastructure that can
handle massive data of volumes and

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,740
simultaneous users, doctors, patients,
insurance systems, all at once.

45
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:49,875
So we need interoperability where
data moves freely and securely between

46
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,605
providers, payers, and patients.

47
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:58,465
And finally, we don't do we need to think
about rural access in many parts of the

48
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:00,715
world and even parts of United States.

49
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:06,025
Access to specialists or diagnostics can
take weeks simply because of geography.

50
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,615
Technology has the
potential to close that gap.

51
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:13,335
So modernization isn't
just optional anymore.

52
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:14,445
It's essential.

53
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:18,945
So we need scalable infrastructure,
we need interoperable systems,

54
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:24,615
and we need solutions that make
healthcare systems accessible limits.

55
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:28,605
So this is where the cloud native
architecture comes into play.

56
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,355
It's the cloud native
architecture evolution.

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,970
So in the last few years, we have
seen a revolution in how healthcare

58
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,370
systems are being built, right?

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,760
So cloud native, Kubernetes based
microservices are now redefining how

60
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,920
hospitals and health platforms operate.

61
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,780
Instead of one giant monolithic
application, which we are trying

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,190
to do everything microservices,
allow us to break that system into

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,010
smaller, independent components.

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,880
Each one focused on a
specific function like patient

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,160
management, billing, scheduling.

66
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:11,135
So these services can scale
individually, heal automatically,

67
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:16,595
and communicate through standardized
APIs such as FHIR, which is Fast

68
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,115
Healthcare Interoperability Services.

69
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:25,665
What does this mean is that we can finally
achieve true interoperability where

70
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,185
every system speaks the same language.

71
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:28,725
Yes.

72
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:35,795
I like to describe it as a turning
giant rigid block into a set of flexible

73
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:40,685
Lego pieces that can be rearranged,
reused, and scaled in independently.

74
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:45,865
And Kubernetes acts as the conductor
orchestrating all of these services,

75
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,835
making sure they're healthy,
resilient, and always available.

76
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,735
So this architectural shift
is fundamentally reserving

77
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,560
healthcare inefficiency.

78
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,770
Is creating, the systems are scalable,
resilient, and interoperable.

79
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,160
Now comes the HIEs on something
about health information exchanges.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,150
So now let's talk about the real
world impact of data integration.

81
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,010
One of the best examples is the success
of health information exchanges or HI.

82
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,700
When systems began sharing patient data
across hospitals, labs, and clinics, we

83
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,880
saw immediate measurable improvements.

84
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,710
Integrated HIEs have use preventable
hospital readmissions by 30%, and also

85
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,410
have cut duplicate lab testing by 52%.

86
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,120
So that's not just efficiency,
that's saving lives.

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,010
So these integration mean.

88
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,460
Patients don't have to repeat their
story every time they enter a new clinic.

89
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,940
It means few errors, faster
diagnosis, and lower costs, and it

90
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,200
shows us what's possible when we
truly connect healthcare systems.

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,885
But data integration alone isn't enough.

92
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:01,170
We need a common standard
for communication.

93
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,570
That's where the FHIR comes in.

94
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,050
FHIR standards adoption growth.

95
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,800
The adoption of FHI standards has
been a major turning point for

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,400
healthcare interoperability, right?

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,190
So what happened in 2017 is
FHI adoption was just 14.8%.

98
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:30,000
By 2022, that number had jumped
to 58.3%, a nearly a four

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,920
full increase in five years.

100
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,950
Wasn't that a great thing?

101
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,210
Yes.

102
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,480
So this search has made extra
data exchange between electronic

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,635
health records, telehealth systems,
and mobile applications, far

104
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,675
more consistent and reliable.

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,370
FHAR gives healthcare data a
common grammar and structure, so

106
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,080
information flows like language
rather than being locked in silos.

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,930
So it's one of the quiet revolutions
behind the scenes that's enabling

108
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,000
everything from smart health apps too.

109
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,420
Cross hospital analytics.

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,280
So there are many analytics, right?

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,240
So now we will see how our performance
benefits come through, which is nothing

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,850
but Kubernetes performance benefits.

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,100
Let's talk performance because
healthcare systems cannot afford delays.

114
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,140
So when we move to containerized
Kubernetes native to microservices, we

115
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,740
saw 62% higher transaction throughput
under normal operations, and 47% faster

116
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,750
response times during peak loads.

117
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,670
Those are massive improvements
in environments where

118
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,030
every second counts, right?

119
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:53,224
So now coming to infrastructure cost
optimization, the cost dropped up two

120
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:57,104
57%, and deployment times improved by 74%.

121
00:07:57,784 --> 00:08:02,754
Meaning we can scale equally when
demand spikes like during a pandemic.

122
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:08,294
This efficiency proves that microservices
don't just make systems flexible.

123
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,024
They make them financially
sustainable too.

124
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:16,234
Now, let's take COVID-19
telehealth transformation.

125
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:20,454
So the pandemic really put
all of this to the test.

126
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:26,574
Before 2020, telehealth accounted for
Bailey 1% of all healthcare visits.

127
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:30,174
Now within months, that
number just jumped to.

128
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:34,775
35.3%, which is a huge change, right?

129
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:38,674
So that explosive growth was only
possible because of cloud native,

130
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,895
microservices based architectures.

131
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:45,694
Healthcare systems that had already
adopted Kubernetes and standardized

132
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:50,944
APIs were able to scale almost
overnight, onboarding thousands of

133
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,045
virtual consultations without downtime.

134
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,694
This was a defining moment that it showed.

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,089
Scalable architecture equals
healthcare resilience.

136
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,269
Now the mobile health
applications impact, right?

137
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,719
So it enhanced medication adherence rates,
better chronic disease, self-management,

138
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,579
and increased patient empowerment.

139
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,290
Data access.

140
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,290
Now rural healthcare success story.

141
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,030
So let's take this idea to
the field rural healthcare.

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,640
In one implementation in rural India,
Kubernetes based telehealth platforms

143
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,390
improve specialist access by 58% and
reduced urgent care delays by 43%.

144
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,850
That's transformative, right?

145
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,290
So it means a patient in a remote
village can consult with a cardiologist

146
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,050
hundreds of miles away instantly.

147
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:47,560
This isn't just about
technology, it's about equity.

148
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,230
It's about bringing healthcare to people.

149
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:57,345
Who were once beyond reach cloud native
systems are not just improving efficiency,

150
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,865
they're creating fairness in access.

151
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,574
Now, design principles
for resilient systems.

152
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:07,344
So what can we learn from all of this?

153
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:12,234
If you're building a modernizing
healthcare systems today, there are

154
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,974
four design principles to remember.

155
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:18,534
Cloud native architecture,
standards, compliance, scalability,

156
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,094
security and compliance.

157
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:25,485
Cloud native architecture, build on
ized microservices with Kubernetes

158
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:28,454
orchestration standards compliance.

159
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:32,055
Implement FHIR, and other
interoperability standards from the start.

160
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:33,615
Scalability.

161
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:38,525
Make sure your system and expand
elastically as demand rose.

162
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,240
Security and compliances throughout
the entire development SI lifecycle.

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,740
These principles aren't
just technical check boxes.

164
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,070
They define how resilient, safe,
and equitable our healthcare

165
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,420
systems will be in the future.

166
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,050
Now, next comes the key takeaways.

167
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,820
The key takeaways are mainly first
data integration is critical.

168
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,590
So breaking down silos through
standardized APIs and health information

169
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,790
exchanges delivers measurable
improvements and inpatient outcomes.

170
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,030
Now, the second is
