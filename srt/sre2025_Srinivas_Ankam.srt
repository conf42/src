00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,350
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,340
I am

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,540
it professional with 20 years of
experience as a retail architect.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,030
Today we are looking at our
site reliability engineering.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,740
Our SRE helps scale a driven
retail logistics platforms with

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,930
rising customer expectations.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,430
Retail needs, smart, reliable systems.

8
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:37,755
SRE brings the tools and mindset
to keep these platforms resilient,

9
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:44,805
scalable, and fast, making a powered
omnichannel experiences possible.

10
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:50,085
Let's explore how reliability
powers the future of retail.

11
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:51,885
Thank you.

12
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,810
Let's look at the evolution
of retail logistics.

13
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,029
We started with the traditional model.

14
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,580
Others took days processed
through centralized warehouses.

15
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:12,780
Then came the omnichannel era,
blending online offline channels,

16
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:18,210
cutting ment time down to 24 hours.

17
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,160
Next, AI powered micro
fulfillment centers arrived.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,520
Using predictive algorithms to
pull bill orders within hours.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,700
And now we are stepping into the
next generation where predictive

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,030
systems start processing even before
the customer finishes their order.

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:50,765
Retail logistics is getting faster,
smarter, and more proactive than ever.

22
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,880
Now let's talk about the core SRE
principles in retail logistics.

23
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,429
First, we have error budgets.

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,820
They help quantify how much risk
we can accept without impacting the

25
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,845
operations next service level objectives.

26
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:19,635
Our SLOs, these align technical
performance with what really

27
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,334
matters to the customer experience.

28
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:32,084
Then there is automation key to
reducing manual work, especially

29
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,805
with continuous deployment pipelines

30
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,930
like CICD pipelines.

31
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:53,130
And finally observability, giving
us deep visibility into complex

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,565
distributed logistics systems so
we can detect and fix issues fast.

33
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,050
Together these SRE principles.

34
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:18,735
Keep retail logistics reliable,
efficient, and customer focused.

35
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:28,125
Let's talk about building resell and micro
fulfillment center, MFC infrastructure,

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,965
A key piece of modern retail logistics.

37
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,815
First, the business volume.

38
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:45,765
We are aiming for 98.7% order accuracy
with one hour delivery windows.

39
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:51,915
That's the kind of precision and
speed today's customer expects.

40
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:58,815
At the core is the A intelligence layer.

41
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,775
It powers predictive inventory placement.

42
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,859
And accurate demand forecasting
enduring products are where they need

43
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,560
to be before the customer even clicks.

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,980
By

45
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:23,190
supporting that distributed
systems architecture built with far

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,159
tolerant microservices and regional.

47
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,570
Failover.

48
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,730
So even if one part of the
system goes down, the operations

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,110
keeps running smoothly.

50
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,950
All of this runs a strong infrastructure
foundation, Kubernetes orchestrated

51
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,170
container that can be at scale to
meet changing demand in real time.

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,930
The lead approach keeps MFCs
fast, reliable, and ready

53
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,400
for peak retail perform.

54
00:04:56,115 --> 00:05:02,535
Let's explore our advanced observability
solutions, the backbone of reliable high

55
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:09,195
performing retail logistics, starting
with tropic monitoring our enterprise

56
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:16,175
grade distributor pricing system, and 10
x tropic spikes during sp peak shopping

57
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:22,745
times without any performance drop paid
with the smartly detection algorithm.

58
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:30,844
Our systems alert engineers to potential
issues before customer even notice.

59
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:39,544
And the performance analysis side,
we use custom metrics to precisely

60
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:44,614
track fulfillment velocity across
all our regional MFC networks.

61
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:49,174
Real time dashboards offer instant.

62
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:58,250
Comparison of actual versus expected
performance for every geographic zone.

63
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,060
And when it comes to business insights,
we connect the dots between technical

64
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,460
metrics and business outcomes.

65
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,224
Our SL word tracking doesn't just say.

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,090
In the engineering VLM, it feeds
into initiative executive dashboards

67
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,940
clearly showing how infrastructure
health impacts customer satisfaction.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,230
In short, our observability is then
just about keeping system running.

69
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,470
It's about keeping customers
happy and the business growing.

70
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:46,655
Let's talk about a powered
route optimization at scale.

71
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,015
A game changer for last mile delivery.

72
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,285
It start with position analysis.

73
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:58,835
We use realtime GPS data from our
delivery fleet to know exactly where

74
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,445
every vehicle is at any moment.

75
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:05,284
Then we layer on traffic prediction.

76
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:09,724
Our machine learning models
forecast congestion patterns

77
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:15,275
before they happen, allowing the
system to stay ahead of delay.

78
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:24,335
Finally, the root competition dynamically
the fast, most efficient farts

79
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:28,325
through complex urban environments.

80
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,330
Adapting in real time as conditions
change the result faster deliveries,

81
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,560
lower cost, and happier customers.

82
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:44,239
Let's walk through our service
level objectives framework,

83
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,669
which align technology, customer
experience, and business outcomes.

84
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:57,744
Starting with technical vos, we target
99 point 99% system availability.

85
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:03,979
A PA responses under a hundred
milliseconds and other processing

86
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,020
latency under 50 seconds.

87
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,039
These ensure our backend stays
lightening fast and dependable.

88
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,804
Next, our customer experience SVOs.

89
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,659
We aim for delivery time accuracy
within plus or minus five minutes.

90
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:35,434
Other accuracy about 99.5% and app
transaction completion rates over 98%,

91
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:41,974
all focused on smooth,
reliable customer journey.

92
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:50,105
Finally, our business customer outcomes
SVOs connect performance to impact.

93
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:52,595
We keep.

94
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:56,255
Cart a abandonment under 15%.

95
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:03,905
Push for a repeat purchase rate above
65% and optimized delivery efficiency

96
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:06,155
to x, exceed 12 orders for hour.

97
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:10,835
This framework keep everyone
from engineers to execute.

98
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:18,335
Two focused on what truly let's drive
into our incident management framework.

99
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:24,065
Designed to respond quickly and
efficiently when things go wrong.

100
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:26,165
Detection.

101
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:32,345
Start with automated alerts through
pager duty, customer feedback,

102
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:35,555
monitoring and synthetic transaction.

103
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:42,930
Canaries proactively catching issues
before they affect the users for response.

104
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,889
We have a structured incident command.

105
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:51,605
With cross-functional teams,
communication channels are pre

106
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:57,185
dependent, ensuring everyone knows
their role and process to Palo.

107
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:03,905
When it comes to remediation, we
use playbook driven procedures,

108
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:08,589
including automated rollbacks
to restore service quickly.

109
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,990
We also focus on customer
impact mitigation.

110
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,690
Minimizing disruption for the end user.

111
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:26,659
Finally, in the learning phase, we conduct
blameless postmortems to understand what

112
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,720
went wrong without pointing fingers.

113
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,629
We track systematic improvements
and update our knowledge base

114
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,240
to prevent future incidents.

115
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,040
This framework ensures.

116
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:50,510
We respond fast, learn continuously,
and keep our services reliable.

117
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,649
Let's talk about chavos engineering in
practice, how you proactively test and

118
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,889
improve the resilience of our systems.

119
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,389
It starts with.

120
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:04,655
Hypothesis formation.

121
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,444
We begin by formulating precise
hypothesis about the systems, study

122
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:16,895
steps and predicting how the system
will behave when disruptions happen.

123
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,964
Next, we conduct controlled experiments.

124
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:27,629
Our engineers intentionally
introduce calibrated failures

125
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,470
in production environments.

126
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:38,089
To test system boundaries and assess
recovery mechanisms, essentially

127
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,630
pushing our systems to their limits.

128
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,819
Then we measure impact.

129
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,829
We correlate technical metrics
with customer experience indicators

130
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:54,560
to understand the real world
impact of system degradations.

131
00:11:56,075 --> 00:12:01,145
This helps us quantify how
failures affect the customer.

132
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:10,744
Finally, the insights we gain
help us improve resilience we use.

133
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:17,950
That's what we have learned to develop
automated recovery system, self ailing

134
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,829
infrastructure, and a detailed incident.

135
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:29,345
S. All aimed at making our system more
robust and responsive in the future.

136
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:34,984
Chavos engineering isn't about
causing harm, it's about making our

137
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:40,175
system stronger and more resell.

138
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:47,464
Let's talk about our lift shift security
approach, which integrates security at

139
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,835
every stage of the development lifecycle.

140
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:57,635
Starting with development, we focus on
real time vulnerability detection directly

141
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:06,665
in the rd, sorry, ID using automated
security linking and code quantity

142
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:13,985
quality gates to catch issues as early
as possible in the development process.

143
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,385
In continuous integration, we apply.

144
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:22,520
Comprehensive static application
security testing automatically

145
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,950
scan for CV vulnerabilities and
validate third party dependencies to

146
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,900
ensure they don't introduce risks.

147
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,910
When we move to deployment, we
implement container image scanning,

148
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:41,180
runtime application, self production,
and ensure automated regularity.

149
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,839
Compliance verification to keep everything
secure during the deployment page.

150
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,079
Finally, in production,
we imply advanced treat

151
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:02,690
intelligence monitoring, leveraging
a powered ity detection and well

152
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,810
defined incident response protocols.

153
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,810
To stay high head up, potential traits.

154
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,089
This approach ensures security is
embedded through preventing risk

155
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,750
before they make it into production.

156
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:23,899
To wrap up, here are the key takeaways
for building reliable retail logistics.

157
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,050
Define clear lvo.

158
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,770
It's critical to balance technical metrics
with customer experience indicators.

159
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:40,444
This ensures we meet business goals
while keeping customers happy.

160
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,375
Invest in observability.

161
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:51,004
Build comprehensive visibility across
all distributed systems so you can

162
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:53,585
detect and address issues in real time.

163
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,690
Embrace automation, reduce manual effort
by implementing infrastructure as code.

164
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,839
Enabling faster, more
efficient operations, faster.

165
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,035
A real a resilience culture.

166
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:17,395
Promote blameless problem solving
and continuous learning to

167
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,835
improve systems and processes.

168
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,315
No matter the challenges.

169
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,995
These principles will guide you.

170
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:30,395
Towards a more reliable,
efficient, and customer centric

171
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,435
retail logistics operations.

172
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:36,784
Thank you.
