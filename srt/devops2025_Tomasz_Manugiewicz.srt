1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,670
Hello, I would like to invite you today
for this talk about quiet engineers.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,889
If you feel you are an introverted
person, don't be afraid.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,770
Neither this equation nor Paradise
Lost was dashed off by a poorly

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,260
animal, when Fred Gallagher said.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,329
My name is Tomek, and I'm an introvert.

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,189
Alright, I'm a quiet engineer.

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,769
I would prefer that way.

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,189
So I'm an introverted person.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,049
Why am I talking about
introvert or introverted person?

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,099
You will find out in a second that
introverted person has some tendency, but

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,259
it's not the, the name of this person.

12
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,900
Let's focus for a second for
this guy, Carl Gustav Jung.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,450
He is the person who defined the
introversion and extroversion.

14
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:48,285
So he said that introversion is
an attitude type characterized

15
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,525
by an orientation in life through
subjective psychic content.

16
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:57,525
So we are, as introverted people,
we are looking inside of us.

17
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:02,185
And extroversion, he defined as attitude
type characterized by consideration

18
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,295
of interests of the external object.

19
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,005
So we are looking outside of our world.

20
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,725
So that's two definitions, right?

21
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,605
He didn't say about
introverts and extroverts.

22
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:13,054
He said about introversion
and extroversion.

23
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:17,525
And, everyone has both extroverted
side and introverted side,

24
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,405
with one being more dominant.

25
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:24,095
That was a big, surprise for me,
because at the beginning of my career,

26
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,875
I wanted to think about myself as
an extroverted, as an extrovert.

27
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:31,754
I'm an extrovert, I speak a lot,
but on the other hand, when I did

28
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:37,194
some tests and, and assessments,
it, it said that I'm an introvert.

29
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:37,294
I'm an extrovert.

30
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:40,085
So I said, Oh, no, I don't
want to be an introvert.

31
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:44,135
I know that introvert introverts are
not promoted in the companies and so on.

32
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:47,175
So I was a little bit, unhappy about it.

33
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:51,875
But when I was reading about
introversion, extroversion, I

34
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:56,765
found out that actually I have some
extroverted part of my human being and

35
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,685
introverted part of my human being.

36
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,895
So I saw that introversion is a continuum.

37
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,155
There is no A or B.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,340
Great.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,640
You are an introvert.

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,800
You are not an introvert.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,700
As an engineer, when I think
about continuum, I see this.

42
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,650
So when I think about the spectrum,
I see the visible spectrum of light.

43
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,350
As you can see, visible
colors from left to right.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,149
From, there is also a
spectrum of not visible.

45
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,350
waves like gamma rays, X rays, and
so on, radio waves on this side.

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,270
But let's focus on this visible
spectrum of, of electromagnetic field,

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,650
which is light, which is colors.

48
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,030
So, we are moving on the
spectrum from left to right.

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,780
And my introversion actually can be
colorful, can move in some situation

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,700
to the more introverted me, and in
some situations more extroverted me.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,710
So I like it.

52
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,130
I use this analogy to, to myself.

53
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,390
And then I realize that I also have
the other dimensions of extroversion.

54
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,520
And also I can be more extroverted
in some situations and less

55
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,870
extroverted in some situations.

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,489
What a relief!

57
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,750
I don't know if you feel that,
if you realize that, but for me

58
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,350
as an engineer who is introverted
and also working in a corporate

59
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,340
environment, that's a huge relief.

60
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,439
I still can do a lot with my introversion.

61
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,490
And just after that, I realized,
I read about the ambiversion term.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,653
So ambiversion is when you have
some extroverted characteristic and

63
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,520
some introverted characteristic.

64
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,130
That's a relief, right?

65
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,420
So I'm not an introvert.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm ambivert with those two spectrums on
introversion and extroversion moving on

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,830
in terms of it depends on the situation.

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,650
Wow.

69
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,680
Amazing.

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,929
I even have the animation
here to show my happiness.

71
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:45,819
okay, so that's one aspect.

72
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:51,449
I can move on this introverted,
extroverted spectrum and realizing

73
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,464
which type of situation triggers me
to be more active and which situations

74
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,224
triggers me to be less active.

75
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:03,814
The other part is those four red
lights, four lights, I have it here.

76
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:07,264
So, the theory from Jonathan Chick.

77
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,564
He defined four types of introversion.

78
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:13,714
So if we are looking for just one
spectrum, introversion spectrum,

79
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:17,444
from left to right, he also
defined four types, which is also

80
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:19,614
helpful for me as a quiet engineer.

81
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,074
So there are four of them.

82
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,825
Social introversion, thinking
introversion, restraint introversion,

83
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:25,935
and anxious introversion.

84
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:29,594
As easy as it sounds, social
introversion is the introverted

85
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:36,365
person who can be with, with other
people, can attend social, activities.

86
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:41,305
It doesn't drain him or her,
but at the same time, he or she

87
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:45,074
recharges her batteries or his
batteries outside of this event.

88
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,405
So you can, for a certain extent,
go to the social activities.

89
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,565
As an introverted person, I'm
this kind of person, and then

90
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:54,965
you can, Recharge after it.

91
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:59,515
The thinking, thinking, introverted
introversion is the introversion when

92
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:04,705
you like to think deeply about some
topics, especially alone, but you know,

93
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,595
spending a lot of time thinking about it.

94
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:10,315
For me it is, for example, preparing
the talks for the audience.

95
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,375
When I'm preparing the talk, when I
think about what I would like to tell

96
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:18,160
you, it's my time just without, just
with me in my room with my notes.

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,270
And that's beautiful flow state I have.

98
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,830
So that's the thinking introversion.

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,610
Restrained introversion is the third
aspect of introversion, when I'm sort of

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,230
in some situation afraid of the social
activities and I want to not engage.

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,940
I want to step back and say, Hey,
today I don't have the energy

102
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,440
to speak with those people.

103
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,500
So that's restrained introversion.

104
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,210
Sometimes I can have more
energy, sometimes less.

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,600
And anxious introversion.

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,790
This is the last one.

107
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,200
When we are, when our nervous system, not
we, but our nervous system is so afraid

108
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,070
of the situation that we don't want to
even think about interacting with people.

109
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,699
We are anxious about it.

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,590
Why am I telling you that?

111
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,490
Because when we put those introversions,
those four types of introversions,

112
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,805
into the equation, This diagram, we
can say that sometimes we can challenge

113
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:13,115
ourselves or try ourselves, if you
will, to move from one type to another.

114
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:17,745
Like, for example, restrained introversion
or restrained introverted person.

115
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:22,545
I can be today a restrained introverted
person, but I can try to Challenge myself.

116
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:27,465
I'll try to exercise to be more
social in the social part to

117
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,175
attend more events to attend.

118
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,195
maybe at the beginning, less crowded
events, but to get extra mile to,

119
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:38,964
to be in this the other type the
same with thinking introversion.

120
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:44,160
If I'm restrained, Maybe first step is
for me to be with myself and to think

121
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,530
about deeply about some, some problems.

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,220
We as developers, as engineers,
will usually do that, right?

123
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,260
That we would love to spend all day
thinking about our, riddles, our problems

124
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,900
in our code, and the anxious introversion.

125
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,950
What I, why I'm showing you that
here because it's rather, it's very

126
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,370
difficult for anxious introversion to
move to just to social introversion.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,770
You would need to move through that.

128
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,675
Middle middle restraint introversion.

129
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,275
So this is obviously just
a theory and the model.

130
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:17,065
We know that, you know, we love models
because as engineers, because models

131
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,465
put our thoughts into the boxes.

132
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,485
But at the same time, we are
human beings and we are not

133
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,435
just as easy as those models.

134
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,665
So I'm just showing you
that for the inspiration.

135
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:32,725
But obviously this is, this is something
that we need to try, try for ourselves.

136
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:33,625
Now, Dr.

137
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,975
Gallagher also said that most
people with social anxiety want

138
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,285
to engage in social settings.

139
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:42,605
But fear of rejection or judgment
prevents them from doing so,

140
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,945
typically to their own disappointment.

141
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:50,875
I can tell that when I was more anxious in
the past, when I was small in the school,

142
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:55,794
a small kid in the school, I wanted to
be part of this social, very active life.

143
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,895
But I just had a fear of rejection.

144
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:04,255
So when I sort of, fight this fear
and realize how I can overcome

145
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,995
this fear, it helped me to be a
more social, introverted person.

146
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:12,275
Because when we have other people,
the presence of other people triggers

147
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,935
emotions into our nervous system.

148
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,050
It's It's important to
know that this is not us.

149
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,280
This is our part of us.

150
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,380
So our nervous system and it can be
triggered by other people presence

151
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,090
because we may be afraid of judgment.

152
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,140
For example, what they
are thinking about us.

153
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,170
Our brains cast the reality checking
if there are any danger situations.

154
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,850
So for example, when someone will
look differently on you, you will

155
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,910
say, or your brain will say, Hey,
I'm afraid of this situation, so I

156
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,240
better not to engage in conversation.

157
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,400
Things like this.

158
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,530
and nervous systems has a
tolerance to external stimulus.

159
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,950
So we just need to realize what's our
balance and level of these stimulations.

160
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,960
The question I had in my mind was that
are we born or made more introverted?

161
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,370
Was I born introverted person?

162
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,180
Or during my childhood
I was made introverted?

163
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,889
And there are research
that says it's 50 50.

164
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,470
I know that doesn't help a lot.

165
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,670
But actually it helps me because
then I realize that it's not

166
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,950
like 100 percent heritable.

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,770
I can determine, I can try
to change determination of

168
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,740
those 50%, so it's promising.

169
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,480
I would like to introduce you to
this, or introduce this person to you.

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,280
Susan Cain.

171
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,260
She's the author of the book, Quiet.

172
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,200
And, this is the book as a subtitle
says, the power of introverts in

173
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
the world that can't stop talking.

174
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,380
I really recommend you to read that book.

175
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,240
when I read that as I introverted
engineer, I was like, wow, right now

176
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,480
I know what to do, how I do it, how
I react and how can I help myself.

177
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,110
So I can, share some, tips and
tricks with you from this book

178
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,710
and also from my, from my life.

179
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,390
So what are the benefits first?

180
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,710
As for me as an introvert, for others
as a, as an introverted, person.

181
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,110
I meant benefits that others have
that I'm an introverted person.

182
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,660
the first one, engineering benefits.

183
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,160
So, as engineers, we have deep technical
expertise, deep technical knowledge.

184
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,660
We want to spend some time, very,
maximum amount of time learning about

185
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,540
us, learning about our, knowledge
about, our world, about technology,

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,805
programming languages, and so on.

187
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:31,205
We have analytical and methodical
thinking, which means that we can

188
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,975
solve a lot of difficult problems.

189
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:35,025
And that's our job, actually,
in the company, right?

190
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,575
To solve a lot of difficult problems.

191
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:42,305
We are detail oriented, in terms
of technical problems as well.

192
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:47,105
So we can very deeply understand
and have the very focused,

193
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,745
narrow focused concentration.

194
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:54,065
What are the programming benefits
then for our companies to

195
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:56,765
hiring us as a quiet engineers?

196
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:01,715
We are strong individual
contributors, very much so.

197
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,135
If we have the task, we will do that.

198
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,135
No matter what, I mean, we are
very motivated to dig into the

199
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:11,845
details, contribute to the task by
having individual point of view.

200
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,575
we do code reviews, right?

201
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:20,485
so, first things first, our code is high
quality usually, because that's why we

202
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:24,395
are so focused, it's so important for
us that we pay attention to details.

203
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:30,654
We, the code part is very high, but
also we have mechanism of code reviews

204
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:36,734
when we Now, it's, it's difficult for,
quiet engineers because usually what

205
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:41,744
we do in the code reviews, we put a lot
of comments to the pull request, right?

206
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:45,054
We review the pull request, we put
a lot of comments, we send back.

207
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:48,934
I had a situation in the past when
two guys, two engineers, were sitting

208
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:52,534
next to each other, desk to desk, and
during one week, they put like 100

209
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:56,824
comments to this code, to this pull
review, pull request with a code review.

210
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,744
Because they had difficulties
to speak with each other, right?

211
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:04,804
So, we are good in reviewing things, but
then we need to also think about speaking

212
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,444
to each other, not just typing comments.

213
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,324
Operational excellence.

214
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:15,014
Obviously, we would like to do all
the things in the best possible way.

215
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:21,244
So, we can say that if we are introverted,
Quiet engineers, we will do our excellent

216
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:24,174
job in coding and we are persistent.

217
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:24,719
You know what?

218
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:25,824
You are closing.

219
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:31,354
You try to close the laptop at 5:00
PM going out the, the office, but then

220
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:36,594
this difficult bug that you have in your
mind, how to solve it, keeps you, awake

221
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:42,164
during diet, for example, because we are
persistent to better, to to, to solve it.

222
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:45,654
What are the leadership
benefits for, for the company?

223
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:52,074
For us, from us as a, quiet engineers,
we, when we are the leaders, we

224
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,354
give the autonomy usually because we
don't want to, micromanage people.

225
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:58,264
We don't to overstep on
their shoes, on their toes.

226
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,784
So we give autonomy usually to people.

227
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:05,134
And sometimes we are frustrated that
we don't have the autonomy as leaders.

228
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:06,754
So that's why we are
fighting for autonomy.

229
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:11,274
Our leadership is thoughtful because
as introverted people and this

230
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:16,014
thinking introversion aspect if we
have it We think a lot about the

231
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:17,854
situations that we have with people.

232
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:23,064
We think about the people we are usually
Mindful about people so this thoughtful

233
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:27,074
leadership and then it moves us to the
conflict resolution and mediation some of

234
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:31,564
us Have this ability to resolve conflict.

235
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:36,939
So See and hear different opinions
and mediate between each other.

236
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,459
That's really important in the IT
environment, in the corporate environment.

237
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,779
And this is big additional
aspect that we have.

238
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,679
The innovation and
creativity in group projects.

239
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:54,669
So on one side, we don't want to or have
less tendency to talk a lot during group

240
00:13:54,669 --> 00:14:00,319
projects, but at the same time, When we
have some thought in our head, creative,

241
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,479
innovative thought, we will explain that.

242
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,279
We'll tell, tell the people that.

243
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,909
It's so important for us that we will
add this creativity part to this group.

244
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,809
Obviously now if we are more
anxious, we may feel afraid of being

245
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,819
judged about this, this thought.

246
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:21,594
So that may be difficult, but if we
overcome this fear is a huge asset that

247
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:26,684
we bring to the table because we have some
innovative ideas that some other people

248
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:30,694
may not have because our brain just work
that way that we are so deeply focused.

249
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:35,304
We would love to think a lot about
the problems and then we can come

250
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:39,654
up with creative solutions and
building inclusive work cultures.

251
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,344
So if we are, if we are mindful about.

252
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:47,594
about people, about what they
feel, how they may be perceived.

253
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:51,234
We also can bring the
inclusive work culture.

254
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,784
Obviously, that's not one
on one, just like this.

255
00:14:55,244 --> 00:15:01,124
But if the mindful aspect of our
quietness brings it as a possibility.

256
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:05,674
And obviously retrospection,
we love retrospection in our

257
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,904
Agile world and DevOps world.

258
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,824
We love retrospecting.

259
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,524
Do you want, do you know what I mean?

260
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,084
Do you like it?

261
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:15,614
Like, we love thinking about what,
especially what went wrong, right?

262
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:17,964
What doesn't work and so on.

263
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:22,074
But, but that it brings the
possibility to improve things as well.

264
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:22,874
. Alright.

265
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:28,264
and other benefits that I have here is
the benefits from the CEO perspective.

266
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,834
I work, from, with the
many CEOs executive levels.

267
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:35,104
And what are the benefits
they can have from you guys?

268
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,514
It's critical.

269
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:39,264
So the first benefit is critical missions.

270
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:44,454
Usually the company there
is one person, one engineer.

271
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:49,914
who has so big trust established
with the CEO or CTO that this is

272
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,754
a person from critical missions.

273
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:55,564
When CTO, for example, has the idea
to develop something or need to prove

274
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:59,814
something in front of the board, he or
she will not come to the team and say,

275
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:02,194
Hey, I know you have the agile process.

276
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:03,734
I have some requirements.

277
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:06,344
Could you put it and
prioritize it for me, please?

278
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:06,784
And so on.

279
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:10,814
He will or she will grab one
person who is very trustworthy.

280
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:17,624
We're ineligible and despite this person's
role, it's the, I mean, official title,

281
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:22,974
this person role is to develop, for
example, proof of concepts for CTOs.

282
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:27,304
It's not, again, it's not official,
it's not like a written role, but I

283
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:31,609
observed that every single executive
has this person in the company.

284
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:35,569
When they need some in depth research,
they will come to this person.

285
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,539
When they need a huge market analysis,
or deep market analysis, put it that

286
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,499
way, they will come to this person.

287
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,759
So this person is like a
sensor to the CEO or CTOs.

288
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:50,069
Losing this person is a big deal, so
they will not afford to lose this person.

289
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:55,109
Okay, what are the tools that
we can use for individuals?

290
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,239
There are some tools that
I use tips and tricks.

291
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,699
First things first, save the mental
energy before important meeting.

292
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,689
So when you have important
meeting, don't just plan.

293
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,879
And that was my my challenge
that I had before that I was

294
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,439
planning my day in the calendar.

295
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:11,844
So from time perspective,
do I have time for it?

296
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:12,494
Okay, I have.

297
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,854
And then, before very important
meeting that I had, I was dragged

298
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:21,304
into some conversation because I
had a time in calendar, but then I

299
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,154
realized that I lost a lot of energy.

300
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,104
And I didn't have this much energy
for my next important meeting.

301
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:30,254
So, save mental energy for those meetings.

302
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:34,784
Prepare for such meeting, I guess
that's obvious, but we need to

303
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,104
remember about that as well.

304
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,104
Come early before the meeting.

305
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:41,514
That's, usually very important
before big, bigger meetings.

306
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:45,414
Because when you come early,
you can, be, let's say, first

307
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,304
or second person in the meeting.

308
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:53,314
And then you have some time to adjust
your attitude or adjust your mood to

309
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,664
accommodate more contact with more people.

310
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,114
More people will be joining you.

311
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,544
They may ask you about, about something.

312
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:04,294
So you will not be the one, triggering
the conversation, which is also important.

313
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:06,994
involved in doing things
during large gatherings.

314
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:10,744
So when you are on the large, big
gathering, and you are afraid of

315
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:13,054
speaking with people, that's okay.

316
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:17,299
You can just Involve yourself in
some activities that are happening.

317
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,019
For example, if there's something
going on with the microphone

318
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,999
and someone is helping, someone
is setting up the microphone,

319
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,569
you can help him or her, right?

320
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:30,979
When there is something with the,
with the PC, the PC needs to be

321
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,979
established, needs to be set up.

322
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:36,849
You can help a person to set up a PC.

323
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,159
So, things like this.

324
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,069
And, have a, have an exit strategy.

325
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,649
So when you would like to leave
the meeting, remember before the

326
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,259
meeting to set up an exit strategy.

327
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,869
For example, I just can be one
hour on this meeting because

328
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,739
I need to do something else.

329
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:56,549
Or it's with the meeting is less
important because meetings are shorter.

330
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,409
But if you are on the conference,
for example, you can say,

331
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,339
okay, I need to be here.

332
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,389
I can be here for two
hours and then I can leave.

333
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,439
I need to pick up my daughter
from, from school, for example.

334
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,109
Or I need to do some email work.

335
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:13,609
And when you say it out loud, you
will hold yourself accountable

336
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:17,199
to say, Okay, two hours passed, I
need to, I need to run right now.

337
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,189
So that's the, one of the exit strategies.

338
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:21,339
Leverage music.

339
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,909
So, that's my tip.

340
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:28,809
What I do before huge conferences when
I'm a little bit stressed, I find myself,

341
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,259
some time, like two, three minutes,
and I listen to my beloved music.

342
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,849
And I'm just with, you know, with the
phone and with the headset, and that's it.

343
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:42,979
And then I can try to recharge
some energy before the talk.

344
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,209
And obviously no coffee
before intense meetings.

345
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:47,779
That's that's that's for me.

346
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:53,279
I don't know how you react on coffee
and caffeine, but I don't like over

347
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,229
stimulate my nervous system with a coffee.

348
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,529
What I do also is preparing
for social interactions.

349
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,129
So I prepare some, opening conversation.

350
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:05,649
For example, when I'm on the event, I
know what will be going on the event and

351
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,939
I can ask, Hey, what do you think about
the presentation that will be going next?

352
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:10,439
Are you interested in that?

353
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,919
And then it's, the
conversation starts flowing.

354
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,299
So prepare some openings like this.

355
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,789
and then, Cultivate deep relationships.

356
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,459
So I know that there are many
people's on the big events.

357
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,839
But if you cultivate deeper
relationships, then you will

358
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,419
spend more time with one person.

359
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,799
Obviously, not the whole event,
for example, with one person,

360
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,119
but more time with one person.

361
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,379
And then you can feel more relaxed in
terms of socialization with this person.

362
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:41,469
For leaders, don't assume that you know,
ask questions, show people's strengths.

363
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:46,879
For example, when there is a
calibration going on or when there is

364
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,949
a conversation about other people's
strengths, show that you know.

365
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,219
Hey, this guy from my team has
this, this and that strength.

366
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,739
I know that because I observe
him, I spoke with him.

367
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,969
So show that to others.

368
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,859
Provide the private spaces to people.

369
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,309
So when you have introverted people
in your team, it's okay for obviously

370
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,699
for you guys to sit alone and work.

371
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,899
Obviously, sometimes there are
meetings that you need to, grab

372
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:15,479
yourself together, but then sitting
alone, working, that's also fine.

373
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:20,189
focus on quality of the work, not on
the speed, and, offer multiple ways

374
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:25,639
to interact, not just face to face
meeting, but also Slack, but also, pull

375
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,619
requests, but also emails, all the things
that can, improve the interaction, but

376
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,249
it's not just like direct interaction.

377
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,829
speaking will help, but
obviously you need to have also

378
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,179
some time for direct speaking.

379
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:42,439
And the one thing that people like
the most is talking about themselves.

380
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:47,839
So not to be scared that you need to, as
an introverted person, need to talk a lot.

381
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,749
you can give people space
to talk about themselves.

382
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:53,529
You can just ask, hey, what
are you proud of recently?

383
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,899
And people are, they are proud of
something, so they will tell you

384
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,739
and you will be able to listen.

385
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,129
That's the trick.

386
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,239
The other trick that, I've heard is
to transform apologize to thank you.

387
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,149
So not just saying, you know,
apologize I didn't, attempt this

388
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:10,049
event or apologize I, I'm late.

389
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:13,369
But say thank you for, your patience.

390
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,849
Thank you for replying
to me on that email.

391
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:16,949
Practice that.

392
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,119
It's very helpful at the end.

393
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,499
just a couple of thoughts
about high sensitive people.

394
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,349
so, I found the research at 70 percent
of high sensitive people have the

395
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:31,049
introversion aspect, so high sensitive
people we have, we have, I say, because

396
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,249
I feel like high sensitive person,
our nervous system is more sensitive.

397
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:39,569
And obviously sensitivity
may lead to overstimulation.

398
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:43,729
When I have a lot of different stimulus
around, a lot of different conversations,

399
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,299
notifications, I can be overstimulated.

400
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,529
Or my nervous system
can be overstimulated.

401
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,559
But, Sensitivity might lead
to vulnerability as well.

402
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:58,329
And, not sure if you've heard about Brenna
Brown and her talk about vulnerability,

403
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:04,209
but she says that vulnerability, when we
show we really are, brings the creativity

404
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,999
as well, because then we are not afraid.

405
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,389
When we show, when I tell you, for
example, that I'm an introverted person

406
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:14,249
and I had challenges with speaking with
people in the past, I'm not afraid of this

407
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:19,099
situation, and then I'm more creative,
because I don't, I'm not afraid off

408
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:23,829
being judged so I can come up with off
or show you all the ideas that I have.

409
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,979
So that's how the vulnerability
is connected with creativity

410
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,709
and also with gratitude.

411
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:32,759
We can then appreciate every single
moment in life, which helps us.

412
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:36,059
Not only jobs, but also in
the, in our private life.

413
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,419
And at the end, I would like to leave
you with this long, but very important

414
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,309
quotation from Susan Cain from this book.

415
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,789
And I will read it for you.

416
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,409
The secret to life is to put
yourself in the right lightning.

417
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,259
For some, it's a Broadway spotlight.

418
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,209
For others, it's an amply desk.

419
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:58,049
Use your natural powers of persistence,
consideration, and insights.

420
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:01,734
To do the work you love
and work that matters.

421
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:05,154
Solve problems, make art, think deeply.

422
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,764
Thank you very much for today's time.

423
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:12,574
I wish you all the best in this
conference and let's stay connected.

424
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:18,004

about anything, just drop me a line on

425
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:20,424
