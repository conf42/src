1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,669
My name is Al. We are going to
talk about the designing and a

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:06,769
centralized person data repository.

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,719
I have around 20 of experience in database
technology and currently working with a

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,029
healthcare company as a data architect.

5
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,650
So we are going to talk about
that, how to design a centralized

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,389
percent data repository.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:25,310
Nowadays a large healthcare organization,
the percent data is scattered across

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,080
multiple systems, electronic health
records, lab reports, pharmacy

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,790
reports, and insurance claims.

10
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:36,650
Our task is how to design and
implement a centralized data repository

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,850
that would consolidate all percent
information into a single, secure

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,309
and easily accessible platform.

13
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,260
For that.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,184
This is what the, today's topic
is designing a centralized.

15
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,449
Percent data repository.

16
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:55,790
Nowadays, the all healthcare
has a lot of data and we have

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,410
to see how to maintain it.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,010
Healthcare, cognition worldwide are
experiencing a challenge in managing

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,300
and exchanging percent data across
various system and institutions.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,840
The advantage of healthcare technologies
introduce new complexity data management.

21
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:18,535
With modern healthcare facility
generating an average of 6 65 terabyte

22
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:22,795
or percent data annually through
various source, including diagnostic

23
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,235
imaging, technical documentation,
and real time monitoring devices.

24
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,275
The system architecture, when we
talk, we are going to talk about

25
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:39,385
here basically Microsoft Architecture
Cloud approach, and cost efficiency.

26
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:42,930
When we talk about Microsoft architecture.

27
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:48,385
Microservice architecture is
evolved significantly to address

28
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:52,405
the growing complexity of
modern data management analysis.

29
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:56,515
Analysis of public health institution
has shown that implementing a

30
00:01:56,515 --> 00:02:00,715
microservices based architecture with
distributed storage capabilities can

31
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:07,104
improve system performance by up to 45%
compared to traditional mono approaches.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,400
A comprehensive study of public hospitals
revealed that organization adopting

33
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,980
cloud native architecture experience a
38% reductions in operational cost and

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,200
52% improvement in data accessibility.

35
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,010
The economic impact of
improved healthcare.

36
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,810
Interability has been substantial
healthcare cognition that have

37
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,489
been successfully implemented.

38
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:35,380
Comprehensive interability solutions
have observed an address cost saving of

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:43,575
$3.7 million annually to reduce duplicate
testing, improved resource allocation,

40
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,935
and enhance operational efficiency.

41
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:51,505
When we talk about the cloud native
approach or the cost efficiency health

42
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:56,245
cognition, adopting our cloud native
architecture have experienced a 38%

43
00:02:56,245 --> 00:03:01,885
reductions in operational cost and a 52%
improvement in percent data as across

44
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,825
department, our specializing cloud based.

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:11,635
Archival system reduced storage cost
by 60, 60% while maintaining a rapid

46
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:18,085
retrieval times under 200 millisecond
for frequent excess percent revy data.

47
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:26,065
The core component is the data
storage and integration data

48
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,195
source layer and integration layer.

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,660
Once we talk about the data storage layer
basically represents the cornerstone

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,620
of healthcare and pharmacy system
requiring careful concentration of data

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,590
type access patterns and complaints.

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,080
Requirement research conducted across
multiple public hospital demonstrate that

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,440
post SQL implementation for structural
clinical data achieved 99.99% uptime.

54
00:03:53,595 --> 00:04:00,765
While managing an average of 7800000.0%
records, the study reveals that facilities

55
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:06,555
utilizing MongoDB for unstructured
data can also improve the time the

56
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:13,665
cloud-based system reduce the storage
cost by 63% while maintaining several

57
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:16,545
retrieval times under 200 millisecond.

58
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:20,085
That is what going on because
it's a used amount of data.

59
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,659
If you talk about, or the same thing,
if you talk about the integration

60
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:30,930
layer, FHIR, gateway implementation,
reduce integration complexity by 56%

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,130
and improve data consistency by 71%.

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,950
Integration layer is basically.

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,930
Serve as a critical middleware
component, facilitating seamless

64
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,170
data exchange between this D
disparate healthcare systems.

65
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,920
Research.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,330
Analyzing F-H-I-R-A-P-I Gateways
implementations across public

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,820
hospital indicate that externalized
API approaches reduced in complexity

68
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,115
by 56% and data consistency by 71%.

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,020
The HL seven masses processor component
demonstrate the capability to handle

70
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,800
850,000 clinical masses daily with
a 99.95% successful processing rate.

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,900
ETL pipeline implementations in
public health environment have

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,380
shown remarkable efficiency in data
transformation and loading process.

73
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,300
According to recent studies, modern
EL system can process up to three

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,540
50 GB of clinical data per hour.

75
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,030
While maintaining data quality scores
above 95%, the realtime event bus

76
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,190
architecture has proven particularly
effective in managing clinical workflows,

77
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,980
processing an average of 12,000
events per second with latency and a

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,870
hundred milliseconds enabling realtime
clinical decision support system.

79
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,075
The security layer, if we think about.

80
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,060
Security comprehensive IM system
reduced unauthorized access attempt

81
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,540
by 97% while processing an average of
500,000 authentication requests daily.

82
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:17,070
R Bs combined with A BAC has sown
to reduce security incident by 82%.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,250
RBS means role-based access control, and
a BS means attribute based access control.

84
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,090
Analysis of public hospital implementation
revealed that comprehensive IM

85
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,160
systems reduce unauthorized access,
attend by 97%, while processing an

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,200
average of 500,000 authentication
requests daily encryption service.

87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,305
Utilizing industry standard protocols
have demonstrated for robust protections

88
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:45,705
for sensitive health information.

89
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:50,565
Research indicate that modern encryption
implementation in healthcare settings

90
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:55,125
can secure up to 35 terabyte of
percent data daily while maintaining

91
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,375
processing over at below 3%.

92
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:03,105
Once we talk about how to design
data model for healthcare system,

93
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:08,445
designing data model of healthcare
system, we can talk about percent centric

94
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,985
schema, FHI compliant structure, flexible.

95
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,275
Storage approaches and
versioning and audit control.

96
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:19,305
PE centric schema.

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,895
Modern healthcare information
system requires sophisticated data

98
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:27,465
modeling approach to handle the
increasing complexity of PE data.

99
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,945
The research analyzing healthcare
data architecture has demonstrate

100
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,525
the implementation of higher schemas.

101
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,275
With optimizing index strategic
can reduce query response time

102
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:41,565
by 35% while maintaining data
integrity across the system.

103
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,430
A study of healthcare facilities
revealed that properly structured

104
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,800
percent centric schema can handle
up to 2,500 concurrent ES per second

105
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,050
while maintaining response time.

106
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,380
100 millisecond data duplication strategy.

107
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,790
We talk about term matching
approach, and we talk about istic

108
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,290
matching approach, deterministic
matching and probabilistic matching.

109
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,985
Deterministic matching like
combining identifier matching and

110
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:15,375
probabilistic is basically we talk
about machine learning based approach.

111
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:21,225
Healthcare automation face significant
challenge in maintaining accurate percent.

112
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:26,835
Identify across multiple system research
indicate in deterministic matching

113
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:30,480
algorithm has shown that combining
traditional identifier matching.

114
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,510
With advanced correlation techniques
can achieve equal rate up to 97.8%.

115
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,400
In identifying duplicated course,

116
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,550
the study of 15 healthcare institutions
demonstrate that implementing

117
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,430
multifactor determinating matching
reduce false positive rate to 0.03%

118
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:55,320
while processing approximately
600,000 records comparison per hour.

119
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,685
The effectiveness of deterministic
matching significant improve when

120
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:02,564
incorporating temporal data analysis.

121
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:04,454
What exactly?

122
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,595
Temporary data analysis.

123
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:11,715
Analyzing historical pattern
alongside by accuracy of 24%.

124
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:15,895
Once we talk about PROTIC matching
implementation, that advanced

125
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:19,165
processing matching techniques
have immersed as a component in

126
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,605
modern healthcare data management.

127
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,655
Analysis of machine learning based
systems has demonstrated accuracy

128
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:29,575
improvement of up to 28% compared to
traditional deterministic methods.

129
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,355
Particularly when dealing with
incomplete or inconsistent data.

130
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:38,755
The research across multiple healthcare
networks has shown that sophisticated

131
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:43,375
probability algorithm can achieve
a match rate of 92.4%, even with

132
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,025
particularly complete demographic data.

133
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:48,655
Once we talk.

134
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,520
Once we talk about to how to
F-H-I-R-A-P-I layer implementation,

135
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,430
this is basically, you can see
the numbers, 42% of integration

136
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:07,510
simplification, 31% data accuracy, 89%
security enhancement, 850 K daily API

137
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,030
request how it manage a lot of data.

138
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,610
The implementation of FHI based.

139
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:18,205
Solutions has demonstrated significant
impact on healthcare data action

140
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:23,665
Efficiency analysis of healthcare
organization has shown that F-H-I-R-R

141
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:28,525
for implementation can reduce data
integration complexity by up to 42%

142
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,435
while improving data accuracy by 31%.

143
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:36,745
Compared to the legacy systems,
the adoption office SMART on FHIR

144
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:41,215
authorization framework has ized
secure healthcare data access.

145
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,570
Studies indicate that implementing
comprehensive FHIR based security protocol

146
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,660
reduce unauthorized access by 89% while
processing authentication request with

147
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,660
an average latency of 180 milliseconds.

148
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,200
Data accuracy daily a I request
and security enhancement.

149
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,460
You can see the numbers, how it
match when talk about real time

150
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,010
simulation architecture, we talk about.

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,550
Change data capture that is also
called as a CDC event publication Data

152
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,210
Synchronization and Conflict Resolutions.

153
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,370
CDC.

154
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,090
The implementation of change data
capture mechanism in healthcare

155
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,400
environment has so remarkable improvement
in data consistency maintenance.

156
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:33,335
The research demonstrate that modern
CDC systems can effectively process

157
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:37,355
approximate 500 changes per second
during peak operational hours,

158
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,015
with average end to end latency
remaining under 150 millisecond.

159
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:44,795
Healthcare facilities implementing
CDC architecture have reported

160
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:50,040
a 57% reduction in data ation
errors, and a 43% improvement

161
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,240
in the real time recoverability.

162
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,735
Event publication system integrate
with masses Q had demonstrated

163
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:01,535
robust performance improvement,
conflict resolution mechanism.

164
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,735
Modern healthcare data system requires
sophisticated conflict, re resolution

165
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:09,515
strategy to maintain data integrity
across distributed environment.

166
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,210
Our research indicates that implementing
a version based vector based solution

167
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,800
mechanism can successfully handle up to
seven 50 concurrent updates per second,

168
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,220
while maintaining data consistency

A system process up to 15,000
clinical queries per second.

236
00:16:56,405 --> 00:17:00,665
While maintaining average response
time on 150 millisecond, we should

237
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:04,025
advance indexing implementation.

238
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,389

272
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,870
Once we talk about implement
consideration for healthcare system cloud

273
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,489
infrastructure for healthcare systems.

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,279
If you see here, we can see
infrastructure, cost deployment

275
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,469
time, the socialization, compute,
cost reduction, storage ion, and

276
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,420
security incident improvement.

277
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:48,094
Monitoring and operations is one very
important part that how healthcare

278
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:52,235
matters is database monitoring,
alerting system, and compliance.

00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,519
The compressing application performance
monitoring reduced mean time to

284
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,239
detection by 62% compared to the
traditional monitoring approaches.

285
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,649
Healthcare recognition.

286
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:16,499
Implementing detailed
performance monitoring capture

287
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,079
approximately 6.2 million.

288
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,519

301
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:21,479
Once we talk about the final
words, if I want to say here.

302
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:26,834
Today as a conclusion, the implementation
of centralized data repository represents

303
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,554
a complex but essential undertaking
for modern health coordination.

304
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:35,024
