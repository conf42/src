1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello all.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,689
I'm going to talk about how do we
leverage sales data analytics to optimize

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,530
the pharmaceutical drug launches.

4
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,780
We'll do a deep dive on the technical
analysis of using predictive modeling

5
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,790
and real time market insights.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,840
I think we'll cover a few topics.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,640
I think we'll talk about,
Standard, challenges in the,

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,200
in, in the drug launches.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,910
Also, how the data analytics,
can be used as a solution.

10
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,069
what are some of the
important KPIs do we use?

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,439
also talk about predictive
modeling and s impact.

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:38,549
on, on those launches, we look at
one of the case study, also we'll

13
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,569
talk about, the real time analytics,
and also some of the best practices.

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,649
And the recommendation and then we'll
look at the some of the key results and

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,229
impact, starting with just giving us more
background and challenges like why is such

16
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,110
an important, issue to talk about, right?

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:02,059
So to develop a drug, in the, in the
highly regulated environment, it takes.

18
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,050
On an average 2.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:11,029
6 billion to develop one, drug and then
60 70 percent of the revenue Produced by

20
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,069
this drug is achieved in first six months.

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,779
So Think about the first few months
of the launches are very critical a

22
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:26,129
lot of products a lot of drug at their
initial phase, they fail to meet Their

23
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,730
sales goals and protection, and then
typically around like you would see 30 40

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,049
percent, Below on the expected revenue.

25
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,409
Also, you can see our development
costs are also going, high every year

26
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:44,289
so with that I think it's an important
problem to solve and then We are talking

27
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,959
about like how the data analytics
how the sales data can be used as a

28
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,059
solution So I think the very first
case is, predictive models, right?

29
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,524
So right now You When you think
about pharma industry, we have

30
00:01:57,654 --> 00:02:01,404
very good models with more than 85
percent accuracy in forecasting.

31
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:06,124
Also we do have a lot of real time
data, millions and millions of data

32
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:09,754
points for the patients, for the
doctors, for the hospitals, which

33
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,244
can be used for the decision making.

34
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:16,154
Also when we are deploying the
field force, a lot of AI model can

35
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,024
be used to increase the efficiency.

36
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:22,834
And then I think we have seen, when there
are the launches which are more analytics

37
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:26,944
driven, they have a higher penetration
as compared to your traditional, methods.

38
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,864
Also, we see, an improvement on
the launch trajectory in the first

39
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,484
12 to 18 months of the launches.

40
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:40,764
I think once you apply these predictive
models, and real time insights, the

41
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,814
KPIs play a crucial role, right?

42
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,984
So that you know that, are you
on track on the launch, right?

43
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:49,874
Are you on track to get to your goals?

44
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:54,174
As we talk about, I think the first
six months are very critical, like

45
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:58,194
60 percent of the lifetime revenue
is achieved in the first six months.

46
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:03,124
so in that time, I think the prediction
accuracy is definitely an important piece.

47
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:07,234
We need to have 85 90 percent
prediction accuracy, using all

48
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,534
the advanced analytics methods.

49
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,359
A market penetration or
adoption by the early doctors.

50
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,799
That's also an important KPIs
to measure, by different teams.

51
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,599
also if you want to make sure we're
reducing the forecasting variance,

52
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,469
based on the machine learning models.

53
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,979
I think now maybe let's talk more about
the, how the predictive models are using,

54
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,819
what kind of models do we make and like
what kind of framework do we utilize?

55
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:35,459
So I think that the very important
one is, the doctor adoption

56
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,649
or the physician adoption.

57
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,429
one of the very, popular models
are doing segmentation based

58
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,999
on these doctor behavior.

59
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,129
And then there's a lot
of data coming, right?

60
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,509
There's like thousands and
thousands of data based on these

61
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,719
doctors, their prescription, their
demography, their sales information.

62
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,239
So these all can be used
to segment these doctors.

63
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,869
into different bucket, right?

64
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,259
And then we can have a different
tactics for each of the segment.

65
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,649
Also, when we think about the
real time engagement, that also

66
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,499
are doing a very good accuracy.

67
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:11,804
the use of these ML models, we are
reducing a lot of variance when we think

68
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:13,594
about the forecasting of this launches.

69
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:17,124
there's a lot of different machine
learning algorithm, used to

70
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,294
analyze, and prescribe, patterns.

71
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,954
you look at the engagement metrics.

72
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,654
we look at a lot of patient level data.

73
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:26,434
which is your transactional level,
medical gains, pharmacy claims.

74
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:32,019
we also use a lot of ensembled model,
like random tree to make sure, there's

75
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,269
a stability right in the prediction, and
we are making sure that we are baking in

76
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,189
all the market condition in these models.

77
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,549
I think maybe, a case study, and this
is not a real data, but, think about,

78
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,849
there's a pharma company, they're trying
to launch a product in type 2 diabetes,

79
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,679
disease area, which is a very big area.

80
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:47,739
Yeah.

81
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,519
when you think about the market, like
you're talking about, maybe 20 to

82
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,929
30 billion dollars of market value.

83
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:56,449
And there are already a lot of
competitors, there are already

84
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,839
8 to 10 market competitors,
with very high market share.

85
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:04,929
So when we apply these methods, when
you apply the segmentation, you do a

86
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,749
lot of real time insights, have the
analytics KPIs in use, definitely you,

87
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:14,189
you achieve a very high 72 percent
prescriber reach in, in first three

88
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,479
months, which is very important.

89
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,959
Also the new patients who are
starting on therapy that also

90
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,519
exceed your target, right?

91
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,309
So for example, in this scenario, we said,
Oh, we want to reach to 12, 000 patients

92
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:29,719
in first three months, but because
of the use of all of these analytics

93
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,537
tool, we are reaching to 14, 500.

94
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:32,544
Okay.

95
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:37,544
also, we are able to do a lot well
in different payor channels, like if

96
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:41,714
you think about commercial, Medicare,
Medicaid, so these, and then I think

97
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:45,024
that the other element is when you
think about the territories, so you

98
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:49,554
can do also a lot of AI based territory
optimization, and then look at a lot of

99
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:54,254
patient journey, like how patients first
diagnose when they get treated, what is

100
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,344
this whole adoption funnel looks like,
and then because of the real time data

101
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:03,234
processing, we are able to process a lot
of thousands and thousands of data points

102
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:05,484
across these doctors and the patients.

103
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:09,794
Now, maybe let's pivot more on the
real time, analytics infrastructure.

104
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:15,474
as we talk about now, we have a lot
of data elements across doctors.

105
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,799
patients, payer, hospitals, right?

106
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:24,299
And then to process these data
elements, we also have, most of the

107
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:29,489
pharma companies are investing a lot
on having, big data warehouses where we

108
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:33,749
have a lot of processing capacity which
can, where you can have your analytics

109
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,479
tools sit on top of that, right?

110
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,279
We're talking about like processing
capacity in, in, in petabyte, right?

111
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,039
So a lot of real time
data, very fast processing.

112
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,099
and then with that, also all of
these, I think the data nowadays

113
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,489
have very good capture rate.

114
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:53,239
So capture rate means how much of
the actual data is captured, right?

115
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:57,519
So when we get like a third party
data, We can see that it covers 94

116
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:03,329
95 percent in the pharmacy side, and
then these Claims or these transaction

117
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,049
also have different layers of quality
checks right to make sure That these

118
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,719
are highly accurate when we are trying
to use in the predictive models, right?

119
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,969
It's garbage in garbage out So the data
quality is very important So that's where

120
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,889
there's a lot of data stewardship and
data quality checks are in place When we

121
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,399
are processing all of these big data sets
And then with that, because of the real

122
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:33,049
time market insights, it also allows us
to respond in a very faster way, right?

123
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:37,299
So we can have a market response
as soon as like three days, right?

124
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:42,179
When we see something and important
insights out of data, we can, we can have

125
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,709
a change in tactics in, in, in three days.

126
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,499
Also the data validation, like
the data you get is like 99.

127
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,699
8 percent accurate.

128
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:55,674
So with the having a right infrastructure
in place, you can process of tons

129
00:07:55,674 --> 00:08:01,174
of data also having a proper quality
checks can give you a higher accuracy

130
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:06,634
and that eventually allow us allow
companies to react in a very fast time.

131
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:13,519
Also, Thinking about the best practice
and recommendation in the context

132
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:17,869
of the product launches or drug
launches in the pharma industry.

133
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:21,299
We talked about that the data
integration is important, right?

134
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,659
Because you're getting data from
different data sources, right?

135
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,839
So you have like sales data, you have
demographic, maybe you have the social

136
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,979
feed like this, like tax mining.

137
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:36,414
So all of these data has to
be integrated together, right?

138
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:41,214
So there's a lot of De identified or
encryption decryption happening with

139
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:46,494
which is done by a dedicated companies
right to make sure there's this compliance

140
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:50,584
and privacy when we are looking into the
data for the doctors and the patients.

141
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,454
there's definitely a very high
compliance standards across

142
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,494
pharmaceutical industry, right?

143
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:02,154
it has to go through a standard,
encryption decryption model where

144
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:05,464
we cannot identify a certain
doctor or certain, patient.

145
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,944
And then also a lot of time when
the data is not available, we also

146
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:11,024
do a lot of data amputation, right?

147
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:11,564
To make sure.

148
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,159
That even for the missing
data, can we predict what can

149
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,089
be a possible data outcome?

150
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,879
data integration is an important
piece, when you're trying to

151
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,329
combine all of this data together.

152
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,729
Also, I think when you're trying
to do, analytics deployment,

153
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,749
either you talk about predictive
models, or an AI model, right?

154
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:32,574
I think a lot of times these models
are expensive to implement, right?

155
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:37,054
It requires a lot of infrastructure
from the IT side, and a lot of

156
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,474
investment from the business side.

157
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:42,684
I think the best, I think a good practice
when you're trying to do any new model,

158
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,044
you can start with a pilot, right?

159
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,944
You can start with, one smaller area.

160
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,994
for example, you can start a pilot
just for the California state and

161
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:54,424
try to see, based on that, are you
able to get, a higher response from

162
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:55,954
the doctor or for the patient, right?

163
00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:00,844
And if you see, a good successful
model and then the same thing can be

164
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,504
applied for the whole nation, right?

165
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:06,024
so this pilot implementation is
very popular, in the industry.

166
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:09,444
and then you can also always
make finer tune based on what

167
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,444
we see on the pilot side.

168
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,324
I think the other important thing is
we talk about the KPIs, but then, we

169
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:17,874
need to have a lot of dashboards, for
different teams, like sales may want

170
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:21,014
to see a different KPIs, marketing
may want to see a different KPI.

171
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:25,804
So having a dashboard, which
is updated more on the frequent

172
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:27,794
manner, like weekly or daily, right?

173
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,934
and then having an important KPIs,
is an important thing, right?

174
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,334
And then I think the.

175
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,179
The other layer on top of that you can
also we can also create a lot of alerts

176
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,769
which are automated So we I don't have
to look at the dashboards every day But

177
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:44,789
it does create an alert right when it
try when it identify an important pattern

178
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:50,024
in the data also based on that, the
kpi dashboard there should be a proper,

179
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,004
resource allocation and optimization.

180
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,874
So these are like some of the
best practice and recommendations,

181
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,184
especially from the analytics side
and the infrastructure side when

182
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,694
you're trying to launch a product.

183
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:04,104
I think we talk about, and these are some
very high benchmarking number, right?

184
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:07,453
When you think about, When you apply
these best practice, when you apply these

185
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:12,723
analytics model and AI, you see almost 45
percent higher market penetration, right?

186
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16,683
Compared to the traditional model,
your launch trajectory also improves

187
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,223
a lot, based on the insight.

188
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:22,623
And then real time data analytics
allow you to response in a few

189
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:23,753
days if there's any market event.

190
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,698
Also, we have seen, an increase
in the prescriber engagement, we

191
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:30,388
increase in the patient engagement
on these AI driven models.

192
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:34,578
so I think, now I think I want to maybe
conclude and I think what are the key

193
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,328
takeaways from all of these things, right?

194
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:40,629
a sales data analytics is definitely,
and key piece, when you're launching

195
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,782
a product in the pharma industry, it
definitely have a measurable improvement.

196
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,917
it gives you a higher market penetration.

197
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:50,947
It gives you a higher Doctor engagement.

198
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:57,732
It also give you an operational efficiency
real time analytics Enable you to make

199
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:02,722
like agile decision making and you can
navigate through a complex Market tool

200
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:06,282
like where you have so many competitors
and so many market events happening at

201
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:11,332
the same time Also, I think the advanced
predictive models also provide like very

202
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:16,372
high accuracy in the forecasting which
Eventually help you to do a resource

203
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:22,162
optimization Integration of these, the AI
models, and I think, it definitely going

204
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:25,932
to improve the model accuracy and the
new AI tool will definitely help that,

205
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:30,002
and real time monitoring, enhance the
global survey across the market insights.

206
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:31,162
Thank you.
