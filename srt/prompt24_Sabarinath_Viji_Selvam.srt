1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,490
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,220
Welcome to the CONF42 Prompt
Engineering 2024 conference.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm going to be talking about the
topic AI in product management and

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,709
how the different AI tools and all the
AI changes are going to be impacting

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,909
the product management process.

6
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:20,579
My name is Sabrinath Bijisalbam and
I'm a product management professional.

7
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,709
I work as part of the
leadership team at dd.

8
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:27,039
dev and I've worked across like
different geographies across

9
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,559
several hyper growth startups.

10
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,110
Now, as a product manager, there
are so many things that you tend

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,830
to do, typically in your job and
there are so many hats to wear.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,810
Think about the day when you had, very
limited time and probably you're going

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,440
to be launching some important product,
but at the same time you had to sift

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,190
through so much of user feedback.

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,210
That was required for some of the project.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,490
Think about the scenario where you had
so less time, but you had to, wait for

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,929
your, analyst to come back with some
insights by processing a lot of data.

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,289
These are some scenarios which
happens in the day to day

19
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,679
life of any product manager.

20
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:12,909
So what I'm going to be discussing is
how using AI, we can actually build

21
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,469
a very efficient product management.

22
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,469
and that would actually give you
ample amount of time, save you a

23
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,049
lot of time, which you can then
utilize for your thought leadership

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,219
or any of the other more interesting
aspects of product management.

25
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,569
I want to start with a bold
claim by saying that product

26
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,449
management is dead or is it?

27
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:32,829
When I say product management is dead,
what I mean is three years down the

28
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,819
line or five years down the line,
product management is going to look

29
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,049
very different from what it is today.

30
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,749
We are already entering what I call
the age of the product alchemist.

31
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,359
What is a product alchemist or who's
a product alchemist and how is the

32
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,839
product management role going to change?

33
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:51,099
there are so many exciting
changes that are coming, coming

34
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,599
the way of product management.

35
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,269
So that's what we'll, dive into.

36
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,469
So before we get into the nitty
gritties, we need to understand like

37
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,399
what product management looks like today.

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,549
So today that is typically an,
UX team or a design team, then

39
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,509
there's an engineering team.

40
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:05,769
There's also.

41
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,289
of the business team and product
management, the product management

42
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,879
leader or the product manager
tends to orchestrate things

43
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,099
between these different teams.

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,409
They also set the product mission
goals, try to talk to users and so on.

45
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,719
So these are the different
responsibilities of a product manager.

46
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:27,849
So be it, setting the strategy and vision
at a slightly higher, or a senior level.

47
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,959
conducting user research, be it
through focus group discussions.

48
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,539
One on one interviews with your
customers, or even running surveys

49
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,749
and processing that information.

50
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,679
So once you have certain initiatives
that are decided, the product manager

51
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,069
tends to create the specifications,
in such a manner such that it is

52
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:51,869
clear to engineering on why and what
they are working on and also linking

53
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:55,139
all the necessary designs and making
sure that is not a lot of ambiguity.

54
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,669
Data analysis, also like one,
major aspect of product management.

55
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,039
As a product manager, you need to go
through a lot of, data on a day to day

56
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,099
basis, especially in the B2C, side where,
you know, sometimes you're very reliant on

57
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,359
your product analyst or the data science
team and, waiting for them to process

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,529
the data and give you the top insights.

59
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,659
Then there's the communication
aspect, the software aspect, where

60
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,599
you're working towards aligning your
stakeholders, sharing, what the current,

61
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,499
Code map, status looks like, and
what are the roadblocks, et cetera.

62
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,639
there's all kinds of, communication
you're doing, vertical communication,

63
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:31,939
horizontal communication, and so on.

64
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,659
So that's also the wireframing,
reviews, part of the design reviews.

65
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,869
Typically a part of where you're
interacting with the design team,

66
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,989
brainstorming and coming up with
ideas, around what exactly needs to

67
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,249
be the concept design, what exactly
needs to be the visual design, how

68
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,229
the information architecture needs
to flow, so on and so forth, right?

69
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,899
Then there's also the QA and testing
part where, which, comes up when

70
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,289
the product is getting shipped.

71
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:57,159
Before that, there's, while there may
be a QA, a dedicated QA team, as a

72
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,969
product manager, you are expected to
test all the different flows and so on.

73
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,629
In the middle of all this, you're
also probably like running meetings,

74
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,129
sending out updates and so on.

75
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,669
you're definitely responsible
for the roadmap of whatever

76
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:10,149
charter you're running.

77
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:11,969
And finally, the go to market.

78
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:17,579
making sure that the different teams are
aware of how exactly the product is going

79
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,959
to be launched in different markets.

80
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,819
This can completely vary depending
on whether it's a B2B context

81
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,449
or a B2C context for sure.

82
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,339
But however, like as a product manager,
you need to be involved in that go to

83
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,179
market, like discussing, the launch
dates, the launch checklist, and all of

84
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,149
these things with the relevant teams.

85
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:36,049
Now I'm classifying these results.

86
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,859
responsibilities into three buckets.

87
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:41,809
One is a ideation bucket, which is,
typically the time phase when you're

88
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,169
thinking and we don't when you're figuring
out like what exactly needs to be built.

89
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:49,639
And once this is done, you enter the
execution phase and once everything

90
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,269
has been decided as part of the
execution, that's when, you're also

91
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:55,039
like barely aligning a lot of names.

92
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,999
Some alignment does happen even before
the execution starts that is between the

93
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,099
ideation and the execution phase as well.

94
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:06,229
What I've done is, I've referenced
several resources on the internet and

95
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:10,139
come up with what is the different
task category and how, what is

96
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,649
going to be the AI impact level.

97
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,329
So for example, when you think about
a strategy and vision, it's probably

98
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,939
going to be very highly impacted
because, when you write certain prompts

99
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,189
to the AI tools like ChatGPT, they
do come up with, what kind of like

100
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,329
product strategy you should follow.

101
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,469
Likewise, creating specifications, it is
something where you spend a lot of time.

102
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:32,329
A lot of, time on making sure
that it's all like crystal

103
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,559
clear, but that's something that
AI can completely, do for you.

104
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,599
while it may not really be reached the a
hundred percent, of the, specification,

105
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:44,779
the know polished document, for sure,
it can reach maybe 75% level and the

106
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,082
beyond, the last 25% of the last mile.

107
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,737
is something you can definitely,
polish and then send it to engineering.

108
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,537
Likewise, in the user research, front,
you're probably spending several hours

109
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:58,107
together, sifting through a lot of user
interviews, like drawing out insights.

110
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:02,087
But once you have processed the
initial data, if you can feed

111
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:05,917
this to the different GPTs that
are available, then they can

112
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,527
definitely extract insights for you.

113
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:14,247
And you can take the next, actions
or, I try to identify like how to

114
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,897
convert this into the feature roadmap.

115
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:19,867
Likewise, the roadmap development is
also something that, Chargibitty can

116
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:23,247
come up with a lot of ideas, but you
need to brainstorm with the different

117
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:27,407
teams that are, available like the
design team and, the engineering teams to

118
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:31,097
finally like fine tune the final roadmap.

119
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:35,837
Likewise in execution development, there
are several areas where AI is going to

120
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,547
be impacting the day to day process.

121
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,527
the last one is with respect to
leading with influence or the

122
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,107
stakeholder alignment aspect.

123
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:45,277
This is where, there's not
going to be a lot of impact.

124
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:49,347
It's mostly a moderate impact, be it
in terms of internal communication,

125
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,247
convincing people like meeting
them and trying to build a team.

126
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,947
case around like why you should
build a product, so on and so forth.

127
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,007
Now let's talk about what are the
structural changes that are going

128
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:03,277
to happen in a digital product
management scenario based on all

129
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,337
the things that we have just seen.

130
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,687
So today there's a
product trifecta, right?

131
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,757
So where there's an engineer, there's a
designer, then there's a product manager

132
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,757
also supported by an analyst, for example.

133
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:16,347
In the future, there's probably going to
be a role, called the product alchemist,

134
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:22,067
which would entail a single person
running like multiple of these functions.

135
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,637
There's going to be a lot of
overlap by, leveraging the AI tools

136
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,657
that are available in the market.

137
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,987
this, role, is going to be.

138
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:32,562
potentially a hands on role
that completely overlaps,

139
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,112
as I said, with design.

140
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,662
There's one person who's probably like
generating the wireframes and the mockups

141
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,102
for a particular project and also in
parallel, like writing and preparing,

142
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:43,892
the code and launching products.

143
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:48,502
So that's how like I visualize, the
future role of the product alchemist.

144
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:52,882
And this is completely possible while it
might be difficult to imagine today, a

145
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:56,272
world of three to five years down the line
is going to look completely different.

146
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:59,422
So there's also going to be
a flattening of the GPM role.

147
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,562
And that's going to be the growing
significance of the senior, I see

148
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:03,592
or the individual contributor.

149
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,939
So if you see, this is how the
product chart looks like today.

150
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,392
There are, there's a VP at the helm,
and then there are some product

151
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,142
directors reporting into them.

152
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,492
And these product director Also
has some senior early PMs to

153
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,532
whom some junior PMs report into.

154
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:21,702
But how I visualize this pro,
this, structure to change is

155
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,872
that it'll become much leaner.

156
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,542
So for example, here you can
see that there are, close

157
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,732
to 12 people, product org.

158
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:30,292
But that's going to
flatten because like there.

159
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,207
The AI tool is going to do a lot, bunch
of work, which frees up time, which

160
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:40,667
means you need fewer people to give the
same amount of output or the outcome.

161
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:45,597
And that would be, I would claim
that it's going to be at least like

162
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:50,227
40 to 50 percent, Reduction in the
typical team size or, they're going

163
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,977
to be leaner and more efficient teams.

164
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:57,307
So we'll, in the next slides, we
will look at how you can actually

165
00:08:57,307 --> 00:09:03,067
like leverage all these AI tools and
become a more efficient PM or even a

166
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,277
PM leader for the, for that matter.

167
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,047
And actually drive a lot
of, significant outcome.

168
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,517
There is, this wonderful
quote I came across.

169
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:15,257
Online where, Abel Joseph, a founder of
a startup called, , which got acquired.

170
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,417
It's, very recently.

171
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:20,067
So this person says, world class
software can actually be built with

172
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,637
less than four engineers and AI is
going to further drive the efficient.

173
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:27,707
So in the next section, we will talk
about some of the prompt engineering

174
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:28,637
techniques that are available.

175
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:34,182
While we can go and ask charge GPT
certain queries, as we, think about it.

176
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:38,377
it may not fetch the best results,
which is why using some of these

177
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:42,277
prompt engineering techniques would
help in structuring the prompt.

178
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:48,197
And it will make sure that the GPT also
understands the exact type of output that

179
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:52,667
you're expecting and the search results
that you get would be more relevant.

180
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:56,197
So some of the common prompting
techniques are one is you can

181
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,177
assign a personality to a GPT.

182
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:02,047
So for example, if let's say, you
are a film, writer who's trying to,

183
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:06,627
Write a script, but you want, you want
the script like, as probably like a

184
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,437
Christopher Nolan would narrate it.

185
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:13,377
Then you can just say imagine you are
Christopher Nolan and then try to help

186
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:16,437
me with, how you would come up with
a storyline or something like that.

187
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,417
Then there's the zero short, prompting.

188
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:22,307
Then there's a few short prompting
where you would give the GPT some

189
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:27,447
examples, meta prompting, where you
can mention a series of certain rules

190
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:28,637
or, specifications based on that.

191
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:32,297
On which you want Chad GPT to
think about a particular problem

192
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,367
and then come up with the results.

193
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:38,627
Then there's the chain of thought
prompting where you give step by

194
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:44,027
step instruction to the GPT and try
to walk the GPT through how you are

195
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,347
thinking about a particular problem.

196
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:46,967
We look at some of the examples quickly,

197
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,137
so this is a example of
a few short prompting.

198
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:55,597
So let's say you are trying to create
content for a client or maybe even

199
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:56,827
for a product that you're trying to.

200
00:10:57,327 --> 00:11:00,267
then you can give the,
give the GPT some examples.

201
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:04,467
So with an example, and you'll say
what's the brief and what's the content.

202
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:08,217
Likewise, you feed it a couple
more, examples, and then you

203
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:13,157
prompt the GPT to come up with
something, for the latest brief.

204
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:19,957
And then you would see that GPT is
able to emulate the tone, the type of,

205
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:25,487
structuring, et cetera, which is Quite
useful, which will also like, help you

206
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,657
in sticking to your brand guidelines
and such rules that you're expecting.

207
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,717
Then that's a chain of thought prompting.

208
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:31,937
We have, two examples here.

209
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:36,457
for example, the first input you are
saying that Roger has five tennis balls.

210
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,617
He buys two more cans,
and that's a query, right?

211
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,472
And you give worse answer as well.

212
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:46,267
And then you are trying to give another
question, but the output comes to

213
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:49,652
be wrong, where you say okay, there
are 23 apples, they use like 22.

214
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,822
Make lunch and bought six more.

215
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:52,692
How many apples do they have?

216
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:56,692
It should ideally be like 23
minus 20 plus six, which is nine.

217
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:58,822
But the model comes up
with something like 27.

218
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:02,802
The same thing how you would prompted
using a chain of thought prompting is

219
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:06,402
that you go with the step by step answers.

220
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:08,577
For example, in the answer you're
mentioning, rose started with five

221
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,322
balls, two cans of three tennis balls.

222
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:12,342
Each is six tennis balls.

223
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:15,882
Therefore it is five plus two to
three uses five plus six, which is 11.

224
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:19,222
Now when you feed it, So now when you
feed a similar question, the model

225
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,492
comes up with the correct answer.

226
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,182
So this is the power of
using prompting techniques.

227
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:28,732
In the next part, let's quickly do a
couple of case studies and see how we

228
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,242
are, what kind of results we are getting.

229
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:34,602
We'll go for, the market research,
market research that's that you

230
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:36,412
need to pursue for building an app.

231
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,902
I actually have quite a few
samples here, for market research.

232
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:43,262
what exactly we are expecting the
GPT to do here is it needs to gather

233
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:48,112
some publicly available data, develop
a few buyer personas, identify

234
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:52,062
competitors, and get some suggestions
on how to fill existing market gaps.

235
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:53,532
let's take an example.

236
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:57,562
let's say, we'll tell the GPT to assume it
is a market researcher or user researcher.

237
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:01,562
And for the app building example,
let's say we are trying to build

238
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:04,892
something in the sports market and
let's see what kind of results we get.

239
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:12,402
This is just an example, an arbitrary
example, trying to build a product,

240
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,322
sports management

241
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:15,902
canyon,

242
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,732
publicly available data.

243
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,532
So as a product manager, you need
to be familiar with certain terms

244
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:24,692
like, TAM, SAM, etc, so that you
can give this feedback to the GPT.

245
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,642
So you come back with, you
get appropriate results.

246
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,972
So in this case, I'm going to
say, try to create a product.

247
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,782
I'm going to come up with the time.

248
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:34,612
Great.

249
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:38,222
It's already given us an overview of
like how the bucket has been growing,

250
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,252
like what the user segments are.

251
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,852
For example, it says like amateur sports
clubs and associations, educational

252
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,602
institutions, so on and so forth.

253
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:46,462
And it's also estimating the market size.

254
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:47,262
Great.

255
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:48,372
This is amazing.

256
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:53,487
So next, what we'll do is, let's look
at, so it does give a very preliminary

257
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,367
analysis of the market research.

258
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,887
Of course, we need to vet the data
points and see whether it's working

259
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
or not and talk to users, et cetera.

260
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,827
Let's ask it to come up with some
features for one of the user segments.

261
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:03,557
Okay.

262
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:05,877
Let's take amateur sport
clubs and associations.

263
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:11,967
And come up with

264
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,737
the primary goal is to streamline
Administrative tasks, enhance

265
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,417
communication numbers and
improve the overall management.

266
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:16,777
That's great.

267
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:20,397
it says we can come up with member
management event and schedule

268
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:24,897
management, communication, notifications,
managing rosters, so on and so forth.

269
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,567
Let's see what else it's coming up with.

270
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:27,277
Great.

271
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:32,297
It's very comprehensive and definitely
very useful as a starting point in the

272
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:37,102
test of time, what I would do is I'd also
feed it another, input, which is to try

273
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,487
to prioritize some of these features.

274
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:41,107
Can you prioritize

275
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:47,347
use ICE or ICE is usually like Impact
Confidence Effort Framework As a product

276
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,217
manager, you would be familiar with
this term and hence you just need to

277
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:55,767
give this input Or Moscow is Moscow
should have, could have, framework

278
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:59,477
Great, it's already assigning values
but this is where, as a product manager,

279
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,647
you will still have a lot of work to
do Which is, you need to actually talk

280
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:08,297
to the users and Try to understand
what is the potential impact from a

281
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:11,587
user perception perspective as well as
from a business perspective, and then

282
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:12,817
try to come up with the high score.

283
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:17,197
But as you can see, you can actually,
once you gather that information, you can

284
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:21,287
input that to the GPT and it's going to
come up with a very, polished structure,

285
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,957
which you can then use for prioritization.

286
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:23,867
This is great.

287
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:27,197
so I think we should just, switch to
the next case study, which is around

288
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:32,197
like a quick data analysis, but this
should give you a good gist of like

289
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:37,567
how across the product lifecycle, you
tend to have multiple ways in which

290
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,977
you can make the product management
process way more efficient using GPT

291
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:46,177
by giving it appropriate prompts and
using different prompting techniques.

292
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:50,187
In this section of the presentation,
We will look at how we can use chat

293
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:54,967
GPT to process the data points related
to churn and the retention of the

294
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,697
customers and see the what type of
insights can we draw and how we can

295
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:00,207
extend that to certain product features.

296
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:05,157
But before we go into the actual data
processing, I would like to, just touch

297
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:09,207
upon why the retention information is
very important as a product manager.

298
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,127
As a product manager, you're
measuring a lot of metrics, right?

299
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:16,217
And retention metrics is one of the key
metrics that you want to measure for.

300
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,437
any of the products that you're launching.

301
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:22,337
The reason being, retention is
a measure of the product market

302
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:26,677
fit of any product and hence you
need to keep a close eye on it.

303
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:31,527
Now, A better retention typically
indicates a better product market fit.

304
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,687
For most products, there
are some exceptions though.

305
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,927
now let's look at some sample data.

306
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:39,137
This is publicly available, it's
a publicly available data set of a

307
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:44,057
fictitious fin, finance, company, and
see, how we can, use that, use ChatGPT

308
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,947
to process information, draw insights.

309
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:52,032
So here we can see the customer ID, the
credit score, some demographic data, then

310
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:56,242
the balance of the user, how long they
have been, using the product and whether

311
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:58,912
or not they have a credit card, whether
they are an active member, what's the

312
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,492
estimated salary and so on and so forth.

313
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:05,642
Now, let's ask dpt to help us
with processing the information.

314
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:09,172
Let me draw insights.

315
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:10,652
customer churn data

316
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:17,452
by pausing it and checking
for correlations between

317
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,022
different user parameters.

318
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:22,442
It clearly mentions the approach and
it says like we need data preparation,

319
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,882
which is typically the data collection.

320
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:27,552
And also exploratory data analysis
is, the fundamental slicing and

321
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,502
analyzing of data in order to give us.

322
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:33,602
Baseline upon which we can
further build insights.

323
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:36,842
So there's also a feature correlation
with churn, which is such as

324
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:40,312
may not be applicable in this
particular case and analyzing trends.

325
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,062
That's definitely possible in our case.

326
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,052
and an optional machine learning model.

327
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:47,052
We wouldn't go into that in this
particular example, but let's quickly,

328
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:50,782
try to, upload this information and
see, what ChargeBD can help us with.

329
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:52,142
So this is that, file.

330
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:52,962
Okay.

331
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:53,912
It is analyzing.

332
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:55,022
That's nice.

333
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,832
I really like the way it has categorized
information into demographic,

334
00:17:57,832 --> 00:17:59,242
financial, and account information.

335
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:03,172
that's what, an analyst
would start with, right?

336
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:09,312
So by doing a quick slice and dice of
what, what the situation of the data is.

337
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:10,132
Oh, wow.

338
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,382
It's also given us a correlation matrix
where it's, drawing the correlation

339
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,312
coefficient, between each of the factors.

340
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:18,022
It's, it's again, a preliminary analysis.

341
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:21,552
And it says that there are some direct
correlations with churn, how the

342
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:25,362
satisfaction score appears to have
a negative correlation with exited.

343
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,852
And also whether, that's
correlation with, balance as well.

344
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:29,222
Okay.

345
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,352
It says the coalition is low.

346
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:32,422
that's okay.

347
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,242
So that's also something
related to credit score.

348
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:38,502
yes, let's, get some visualizations.

349
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,942
So draw more insights

350
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,692
by categorizing into segments.

351
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:47,542
It does say geography, gender, and car
type, but I'm not sure like why it is

352
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:53,722
not taken up, let's say something like a
salary or age which were present there.

353
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:59,062
But yeah, let's give that as an input just
after it finishes analyzing, this part.

354
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:00,112
Oh, it's here.

355
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:02,602
It's the tenure balance
and satisfaction score.

356
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:03,762
no problem.

357
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:11,992
Can you run an analysis also, by
including the age, salary, points?

358
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,992
Let's see how these correlate to

359
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:15,832
Interesting.

360
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,722
I love the way it gets the
fundamental blocks, right?

361
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:20,052
Let's see, if we are able
to, get some insights here.

362
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:25,992
clearly it's, also, showing a little
bit about, like, how, the senior, folks,

363
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:30,202
they seem to be at a slightly higher,
churn rate compared to the young ones.

364
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:33,262
there doesn't seem to be a lot of,
difference in the churn rate, based on

365
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,882
the, salary segment or the point segment.

366
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,832
So I think this is good.

367
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:42,142
Now let's, let's think about this a little
bit, why, this analysis is important.

368
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:46,052
So in a typical product management
setting, as a product manager, you would

369
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,912
need to raise this, analysis request with
the analytics team and depending on their

370
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:55,102
bandwidth, they may already have some
backlog items, which means this analysis

371
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:59,082
might have taken maybe between a few days
to maybe even a week or two, depending on

372
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:00,422
the size of the org and the priorities.

373
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:06,102
When you leverage GPT, you can typically
do this preliminary analysis yourself, and

374
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:09,452
you can actually request your analytics
team just to build on top of this.

375
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:16,182
So that's a humongous time saving
that you can gain by, prompting

376
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,132
GPT with the specific ones.

377
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:21,692
So you just need to know that you need
to run the retention analysis and see

378
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,982
like how you can What are the factors
based on which you need to segment?

379
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:28,392
and what are the different
parameters that might correlate?

380
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,202
So for example, in this case, it didn't
call out the age in the beginning, but

381
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:34,512
then like I did prompt it, with, the age.

382
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,732
And then then we were able
to draw some insights.

383
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:41,592
Now let's just do one last bit, which
is to see if we can ask chat GPT to

384
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:45,792
suggest like what kind of features
we need to build to address this, to

385
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:46,472
create.

386
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:49,472
It has given us a series of,
potential features that we can

387
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:50,982
build, which is quite interesting.

388
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:51,702
And

389
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:52,512
Nice.

390
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,077
Yeah, this is great.

391
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,267
So this is a good input and
we can further enhance it.

392
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,107
But let's move on to the next
part of the presentation.

393
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,107
This is just a very quick example.

394
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:05,997
So I hope the micro case studies that we
mentioned are quite, were quite helpful.

395
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:10,387
And if you have any questions, feel
free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

396
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:14,287
And I want to conclude by
saying that there's just so much

397
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,117
excitement around AI, obviously.

398
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,307
And there's just so many use
cases using which we can leverage

399
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,547
AI in product management.

400
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:26,797
And Make our processes way more
efficient, build leaner teams, and, and

401
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,877
be able to deliver much better impact.

402
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:29,857
Thanks for listening.
