1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,350
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,310
Greetings for the day.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,030
Welcome to Con 42, machine Learning 2025.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,840
Thanks for taking out the time
and joining me in this session.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,790
I am Neha Hacker, an associate
solutions architect with AWS,

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,470
and I'm based out of London.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,730
I predominantly work with financial
services and FinTech customers

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,770
within the UK to help them design and
optimize their architectures on AWS.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,060
Today I'm here to talk about how
you can transform your customer

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,830
interactions into actionable insights
in near real time, whether it's

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,990
phone calls or chat conversations.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,370
This solution helps you understand what
your customers are saying, how they are

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,040
feeling, and what topics matter the most.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,510
Let's walk through a typical
day at a bank's call center.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,489
It's 9:00 AM the morning starts
with an unexpected surgeon calls.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,630
Is it a system issue, a new
policy causing confusion?

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,560
Without new real time
analytics, no one knows.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,540
It is now 11:00 AM Multiple
customers are raising concerns.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,750
Agents sense a pattern, but there's
no way to confirm or quantify the

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,780
trend and valuable time is lost.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,850
It is now 2:00 PM The quality
team is manually reviewing

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,020
yesterday's interactions.

23
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,830
Critical customer feedback
from this morning won't be

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,840
analyzed until next evening.

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,140
It is now 4:00 PM management
reviews, daily metrics, showing

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,490
declining performance, but lacks
the insights to understand root

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,160
causes or take preventative action.

28
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:46,919
The result a day filled with
reactive decision making, missed

29
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,090
improvement opportunities.

30
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:53,325
Frustrated customers and agents
and lost business intelligence.

31
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,485
Now let's examine what happens when
you can't analyze your customer

32
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:03,075
interactions Every day, thousands
of customer interactions occur,

33
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:08,445
but most of this valuable feedback
remains unanalyzed and unutilized.

34
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:13,725
This creates significant delays
in identifying emerging issues,

35
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,745
allowing problems to multiply
before we can address them.

36
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,149
The result unnecessary costs from
handling preventable repeat calls,

37
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,130
each representing a customer issue
that could have been resolved earlier

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,780
without analysis of this conversations.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,839
We miss crucial insights that could help
prevent future issues and improve service.

40
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:45,494
This isn't just about missing data,
it's about every frustrated customer,

41
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:50,625
every missed opportunity, and every
preventable problem that slips through

42
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,445
the cracks because we are flying blind.

43
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:58,605
So let's look at how this solution
can help solve this problem.

44
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,245
It creates complete visibility.

45
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:07,394
Remember those thousands of unanalyzed
conversations, our solution ensures

46
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,255
every interaction is captured.

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,490
And analyzed automatically.

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,180
No more blind spots, no
more missed insights.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,990
It gives near real time intelligence.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,420
Instead of waiting days to identify
issues, you'll know immediately what's

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,820
happening in your customer conversations.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,350
Think of it as giving your team
superhuman listening abilities.

53
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,905
It does intelligent analysis.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,950
Gone are the days of manual reviews.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,340
Our AI engine automatically understands
what customers are talking about and how

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,250
they are feeling across every interaction.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,370
From audio calls and chat support,
it provides predictive action.

58
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,250
This isn't just about faster analysis,
it's about getting ahead of issues.

59
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,600
You'll spot trends as they emerge,
not after they have become problems.

60
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:10,305
Transform from reactive to
proactive service, and it also

61
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,705
helps generate strategic insights.

62
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:17,235
Finally, all of this intelligence
feeds in, feeds directly

63
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:18,525
into your decision making.

64
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:22,335
Every customer conversation
becomes a source of strategic

65
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,655
insight for your business.

66
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:29,655
This isn't just an analytics tool, it's
a complete transformation in how you

67
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,630
understand and serve your customers.

68
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,340
In banking where every customer
interaction matters, this level of insight

69
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,890
creates a genuine competitive advantage.

70
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,610
Now, let's walk through how our solution
transforms customer conversations

71
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,440
into actionable intelligence.

72
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,090
It starts with capturing every
customer interaction, whether it's

73
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,729
voice calls from your contact center.

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,550
Or chat conversations
with your service team.

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,340
Every customer touchpoint is automatically
collected and securely stored.

76
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,450
This ensures we don't miss any
valuable customer feedback.

77
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,920
Next, our processing engine goes to work.

78
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,870
Voice calls are automatically
converted to text while chat

79
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,510
messages are extracted and stored.

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,670
This happens in near real time,
creating a unified format for

81
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,410
all customer interactions.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,790
Think of it as translating every
customer conversation into a

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,405
language or analytics can understand.

84
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,735
This is where the intelligence happens.

85
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:43,485
Our AI engine analyzes every conversation.

86
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:46,155
What are the customers talking about?

87
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:47,955
How are they feeling?

88
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:49,785
What patterns are emerging?

89
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:55,125
This gives us deep insights into customer
needs and concerns as they happen.

90
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,255
Finally, we transform this
intelligence into action.

91
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:05,085
Through interactive dashboards
and reports your team scan spot

92
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:11,055
trends, instantly identify issues
early, make data-driven decisions.

93
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:14,565
The beauty of this
solution is its simplicity.

94
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,635
It's completely automated.

95
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:21,820
Running 24 by seven, taking every customer
interaction into business intelligence.

96
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:29,505
No manual processing, no sampling, no
delays, just continuous near real time

97
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,535
insights from every customer conversation.

98
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:37,914
Think of it as giving your organization
a super human, the ability to listen

99
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:42,925
to, understand, and act on every
customer interaction simultaneously.

100
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,565
Now, let's build this
architecture using AWS.

101
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,400
We begin with two types of customer
interactions, voice calls store

102
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,340
does, audio files, and Amazon S3 chat
conversations from your support team.

103
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,659
For voice calls, we have
built an automated pipeline.

104
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,330
When a new audio file lands in
S3, it triggers a Lambda function.

105
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,409
This transcribed Lambda function
calls Amazon transcribe.

106
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,715
The resulting transcript
is sowed in an S3 bucket.

107
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:25,224
Next, we handle both the
transcribed calls and chat logs.

108
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,275
Another S3 activates our
sentiment Lambda function.

109
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:35,490
This function leverages Amazon comprehend,
which goes beyond basic text analysis.

110
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:42,024
Comprehend understands banking context
automatically identifies key topics like

111
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:44,784
loan applications or account issues.

112
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,584
It detects customer sentiment
throughout the conversation, helping

113
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,594
you spot satisfaction trends.

114
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:56,874
It helps recognize patterns and
customer inquiries, helping you identify

115
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:59,124
emerging issues before they escalate.

116
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,989
The structured analysis is
then stored for further use.

117
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,639
Finally, we make all of these actionable
insights actionable and accessible.

118
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:16,399
Amazon QuickSight transforms this wealth
of data into interactive dashboards

119
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,919
that your teams can actually use.

120
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,279
It offers machine learning powered anomaly
detection to automatically flag unusual

121
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,064
patterns and customer interactions.

122
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:32,105
Business users can ask questions
in natural language, no technical

123
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:38,284
skills needed for deeper analysis,
we can use Athena to run SQL queries

124
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,984
directly on the data in the S3 bucket.

125
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:46,904
What's powerful about this
architecture is it is automatic

126
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:49,514
and then it is near real time.

127
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:54,434
From the moment a call lands
or a chat closes, the analysis

128
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,354
begins within minutes.

129
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:58,634
The insights are available
in your dashboards.

130
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:03,044
There's no manual processing,
no delays, and no sampling.

131
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,534
Every interaction is analyzed.

132
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:10,154
This solution gives you a
complete, near real time view

133
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,714
of your customer interactions.

134
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,954
You're not just handling
customer service anymore.

135
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:19,544
You're turning every customer conversation
into valuable business intelligence.

136
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,009
Imagine identifying trends and
issues before they become problems,

137
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:31,649
understanding customer sentiment
across thousands of interactions and

138
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,209
making data-driven decisions based
on actual customer conversations.

139
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:39,869
Now let's look at a quick live demo.

140
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,709
So I have created this
solution on AWS console.

141
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:48,269
You can also create it using
infrastructure as code.

142
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,359
So this is how AWS console looks like.

143
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,899
You'll be able to select the
region where you want to deploy

144
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,750
your workloads or your solutions.

145
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,209
So I have used London region here.

146
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:04,009
And here you'll be able to see
my recently visited AWS services.

147
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,530
You will also be able to navigate
to this by clicking on the links

148
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,230
here, or you'll be able to search a
service here and go to the service.

149
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,770
Or if you click these buttons, you'll be
able to navigate to AWS services as well.

150
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,055
So now let's look at S3.

151
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,324
So I have created an S3
bucket within the bucket.

152
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:31,405
I have created these
folders for audio files.

153
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:36,355
This is where I'm gonna upload
the audio file of a chat of a

154
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:38,485
conversation along with its metadata.

155
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,574
So I will just upload an audio file.

156
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:51,995
Here along with its metadata, JSON
file, and this is gonna upload in a

157
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:53,855
fraction of seconds as you can see.

158
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:58,365
Once this is done this event
triggers a lambda function.

159
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:03,855
Lambda function will now call Amazon
Transcribe, which is a transcription

160
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,525
service to convert speech to text.

161
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,635
So here, if you see there's a
transcription job in progress,

162
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:14,444
but in the interest of time, I'm
gonna show you how it looks like

163
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,635
once the transcription is done.

164
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:20,535
So here you'll be able to see
the employee details, customer

165
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,875
details, and the transcript.

166
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:28,095
This information will be
stored in another folder of S3

167
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,954
bucket called extracted files.

168
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:35,725
Once this is stored here in this
folder again, a lambda is triggered,

169
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:40,195
which calls Amazon comprehend
sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

170
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:45,985
So if you see, you'll be able to see
that topic modeling job is in progress.

171
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,835
So again, in the interest of
time, I'm gonna show you how this,

172
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,395
how the final output looks like.

173
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:54,085
So it looks like this here.

174
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,965
So you have employee Id name,
customer ID name, and account type.

175
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:00,465
You have the transcript.

176
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:05,315
And we have done a sentiment analysis
on this transcript using comprehend.

177
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,865
So it is negative sentiment.

178
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,655
Comprehend also gives you a score
such as here it is saying it is

179
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:17,005
99.5% sure that this conversation
has a negative sentiment to it.

180
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,070
And for topic modeling, again,
I have selected 10 topics to be

181
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,110
picked up by Amazon comprehend.

182
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,880
So you'll be able to see all of those
here and the related terms to each topic.

183
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,130
And if you scroll down, you'll
see the metadata of this file.

184
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,960
So all of this is against stored into
another bucket of S3 call combined.

185
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,000
So you have all of this here.

186
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,905
Now I am feeding all of this
data into Amazon QuickSight

187
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,435
to create visualizations.

188
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:53,025
So this, these visualizations could be
created based on your requirement but

189
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:57,645
for this demo, I have created few sample
visuals like the one on the screen.

190
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,315
The first one is distribution
of customer sentiment.

191
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:04,875
So we have gotten 61 customer
conversations, either through chat

192
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,645
messages or through audio calls.

193
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:10,215
So I'm showing the sentiment
across these conversations here.

194
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:15,655
Here you'll be able to see the sentiment
distribution across across the account

195
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:20,665
type, such as which account type has a
negative sentiment associated to it, or

196
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,735
a positive sentiment associated to it.

197
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,125
And topic analysis dashboards.

198
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:29,545
I'm gonna show the dominant
topic in customer conversations.

199
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,000
So if you have.

200
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,500
Topics such as account services for
which the customers are calling you

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,490
often, such as how do I open an account,
how do I close an account, et cetera.

202
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,680
You'll be able to look at these
dashboards to maybe create an FAQs

203
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,070
document so customers can help
themselves rather than calling the

204
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,870
agents at the banking call center.

205
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,100
This way you are reducing the
calls that can be that can

206
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,480
be self-served by customers.

207
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:01,315
And here in customer service performance,
I have created a visual which

208
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,235
shows the performance of an agent.

209
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,975
So if an agent has a con consistent
negative sentiment while talking

210
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:11,515
to customers, you'll be able to
put them on a training program.

211
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:15,355
So you're making the customer,
sub customer experience positive.

212
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,480
Some other features of QuickSight
are you'll be able to connect to

213
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,770
QuickSight from all of these data
sources listed on my screen here and,

214
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,060
you'll be able to create executive
summaries and data stories of these

215
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,900
dashboards, such as executive summary.

216
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,890
I'm gonna click here.

217
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,750
So this is how you can do it.

218
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,010
And for data stories you'll be
able to create or select visual.

219
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:51,220
So I'm gonna write, create Me
data story for negative sentiment.

220
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:54,475
Then I'm gonna add visuals.

221
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:57,745
I'm going to select
these two click on build.

222
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:02,965
So it's gonna build me a data story based
on the visuals that I have selected.

223
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:09,775
It takes a couple of minutes to run, okay?

224
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:15,025
So here you'll be able to change
the format styles of the story

225
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,035
based on your requirement.

226
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:20,825
And here it gives you a good introduction.

227
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,470
A story for each visual, and at
the end it also gives you things

228
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,390
like these and also a conclusion.

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,830
So I think it's good for the people who
are reporting to the leadership at the end

230
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,690
of a quarter or at the end of the month.

231
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,400
It's quite handy for them.

232
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,630
Now, let me explain why
our architecture's, modern

233
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,160
design makes it so powerful.

234
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:43,405
It.

235
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:48,355
Our solution is completely event driven,
which means when a new call recording

236
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:53,905
occurs or arrives in an S3 bucket,
it automatically triggers analysis.

237
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:58,465
When chat conversations end,
they immediately get processed.

238
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,675
No scheduling, no batching, no delays.

239
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:07,555
Think of it as having an incredibly
efficient assembly line that

240
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,415
starts working the moment.

241
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,705
New information arrives.

242
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:15,845
And being serverless transforms
how we deliver the solution.

243
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,145
There's no infrastructure for
you to manage or maintain.

244
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:22,265
The system automatically
scales with your volume.

245
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:26,735
Whether you're processing hundred
or thousands of conversations, you

246
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,705
only pay for actual processing time.

247
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,235
No idle resources.

248
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,960
And this architecture
delivers three key advantages.

249
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,780
Speed analysis starts instantly
when conversations end efficiency.

250
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,950
Resources are used only when
needed Cost effectiveness.

251
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,050
You only pay for what you process.

252
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,850
And what does it mean
to you as a business?

253
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,910
There's no capacity planning needed, no
infrastructure management, no upfront

254
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,760
cost, automatically scaling during busy
periods, and cost optimizations built in.

255
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:11,360
Built in these modern approaches ensure
you're always ready to handle customer

256
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,550
interactions, whether it's a quiet Sunday
morning or your busiest hour on a Monday.

257
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,460
And security is fundamental
to this architecture.

258
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,110
Let me show you how we protect
your customer data at every level.

259
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,135
Data protection.

260
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:32,195
Everything starts with
comprehensive data protection.

261
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:37,745
All customer data is stored in S3 and
which is automatically encrypted at rest.

262
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,435
Every transmission between
services is encrypted.

263
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:47,480
We use A-W-S-K-M-S for secure key
management give you, giving you complete

264
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
control over your encryption keys.

265
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,635
Access control.

266
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:54,065
We implement certain access controls.

267
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:57,965
Each component operates
with specific IAM roles.

268
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:01,415
Lambda functions have
precisely defined permissions.

269
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:05,615
No service has more access
than it absolutely needs.

270
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:10,025
Think of it as each component
having its own security badge.

271
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,410
With every specific access, right?

272
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,020
Compliance features for
banking compliance, transcribe

273
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,220
automatically identifies and can
redirect sensitive information.

274
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,470
Every action is logged in
CloudTrail for audit purposes.

275
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,620
We maintain continuous
compliance monitoring.

276
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,230
This ensures you know exactly what's
happening with your data at all times

277
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,680
and coming to infrastructure security.

278
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:45,095
At the infrastructure level,
services run in your VPC network

279
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:46,955
access is tightly controlled.

280
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:53,465
Continuous security monitoring alerts
you to any unusual activity, and

281
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,945
the beauty of this design is that
security isn't an afterthought.

282
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,395
It's built into every
component and interaction.

283
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:06,035
You get enterprise grade security
automatically helping you maintain

284
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:09,455
compliance while protecting your
customer's sensitive information.

285
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,840
Now let's wrap up what
we have covered today.

286
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,180
You have seen how this solution
automatically analyzes every customer

287
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,280
interaction, delivers near real
time insights for calls and chats.

288
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,960
Securely scales with your
needs, turns customer feedback

289
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,370
into actionable intelligence.

290
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,130
And in the demo, you have seen how this
works in practice from conversation

291
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,070
to insight in minutes, not taste.

292
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,040
And this isn't just about better
analytics, it is also about

293
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,840
understanding your customers better,
solving problems before they escalate,

294
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,450
making informed decisions based on.

295
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,370
Real data staying ahead in
competitive banking environment.

296
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,930
The question isn't whether you need
these insights, it's how quickly you

297
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,940
want to start benefiting from them.

298
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,360
Thanks for staying with me till here.

299
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,570
I would love to connect with
you, so please feel free to

300
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,310
connect with me on LinkedIn.

301
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,460
Thanks so much.

302
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:14,610
Bye.
