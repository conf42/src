1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,350
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,310
Greetings for the day.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,180
Welcome to Con 42, machine Learning 2025.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,840
Thanks for taking out the time
and joining me in this session.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,790
I am Neha Hacker, an associate
solutions architect with AWS,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,470
and I'm based out of London.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,760
I predominantly work with financial
services and FinTech customers

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,770
within the UK to help them design and
optimize their architectures on AWS.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,060
Today I'm here to talk about how
you can transform your customer

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,830
interactions into actionable insights
in near real time, whether it's

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,990
phone calls or chat conversations.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,370
This solution helps you understand what
your customers are saying, how they are

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,040
feeling, and what topics matter the most.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,510
Let's walk through a typical
day at a bank's call center.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,489
It's 9:00 AM the morning starts
with an unexpected surgeon calls.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,630
Is it a system issue, a new
policy causing confusion?

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,560
Without new real time
analytics, no one knows.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,570
It is now 11:00 AM Multiple
customers are raising concerns.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,750
Agents sense a pattern, but there's
no way to confirm or quantify the

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,780
trend and valuable time is lost.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,850
It is now 2:00 PM The quality
team is manually reviewing

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,020
yesterday's interactions.

23
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,800
Critical customer feedback
from this morning won't be

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,840
analyzed until next evening.

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,140
It is now 4:00 PM management
reviews, daily metrics, showing

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,460
declining performance, but lacks
the insights to understand root

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,160
causes or take preventative action.

28
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:46,919
The result a day filled with
reactive decision making, missed

29
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,509
improvement opportunities.

30
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:53,325
Frustrated customers and agents
and lost business intelligence.

31
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:58,485
Now let's examine what happens when
you can't analyze your customer

32
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:03,075
interactions Every day, thousands
of customer interactions occur,

33
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:08,445
but most of this valuable feedback
remains unanalyzed and unutilized.

34
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:13,725
This creates significant delays
in identifying emerging issues,

35
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,745
allowing problems to multiply
before we can address them.

36
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,149
The result unnecessary costs from
handling preventable repeat calls,

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,130
each representing a customer issue
that could have been resolved earlier

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,780
without analysis of this conversations.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,839
We miss crucial insights that could help
prevent future issues and improve service.

40
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:45,494
This isn't just about missing data,
it's about every frustrated customer,

41
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:50,625
every missed opportunity, and every
preventable problem that slips through

42
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,445
the cracks because we are flying blind.

43
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:58,605
So let's look at how this solution
can help solve this problem.

44
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,245
It creates complete visibility.

45
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:07,394
Remember those thousands of unanalyzed
conversations, our solution ensures

46
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,255
every interaction is captured.

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,490
And analyzed automatically.

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,210
No more blind spots, no
more missed insights.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,990
It gives near real time intelligence.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,390
Instead of waiting days to identify
issues, you'll know immediately what's

51
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,820
happening in your customer conversations.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,350
Think of it as giving your team
superhuman listening abilities.

53
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,915
It does intelligent analysis.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,950
Gone are the days of manual reviews.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,340
Our AI engine automatically understands
what customers are talking about and how

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,250
they are feeling across every interaction.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,370
From audio calls and chat support,
it provides predictive action.

58
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,250
This isn't just about faster analysis,
it's about getting ahead of issues.

59
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,600
You'll spot trends as they emerge,
not after they have become problems.

60
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:10,275
Transform from reactive to
proactive service, and it also

61
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,705
helps generate strategic insights.

62
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:17,235
Finally, all of this intelligence
feeds in, feeds directly

63
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:18,525
into your decision making.

64
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:22,335
Every customer conversation
becomes a source of strategic

65
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,655
insight for your business.

66
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:29,655
This isn't just an analytics tool, it's
a complete transformation in how you

67
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,630
understand and serve your customers.

68
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,310
In banking where every customer
interaction matters, this level of insight

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,890
creates a genuine competitive advantage.

70
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,640
Now, let's walk through how our solution
transforms customer conversations

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,440
into actionable intelligence.

72
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,090
It starts with capturing every
customer interaction, whether it's

73
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,729
voice calls from your contact center.

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,550
Or chat conversations
with your service team.

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,340
Every customer touchpoint is automatically
collected and securely stored.

76
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,450
This ensures we don't miss any
valuable customer feedback.

77
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,920
Next, our processing engine goes to work.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,870
Voice calls are automatically
converted to text while chat

79
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,510
messages are extracted and stored.

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,700
This happens in near real time,
creating a unified format for

81
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,410
all customer interactions.

82
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,790
Think of it as translating every
customer conversation into a

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,405
language or analytics can understand.

84
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,705
This is where the intelligence happens.

85
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:43,515
Our AI engine analyzes every conversation.

86
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:46,155
What are the customers talking about?

87
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,955
How are they feeling?

88
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:49,785
What patterns are emerging?

89
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:55,155
This gives us deep insights into customer
needs and concerns as they happen.

90
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,255
Finally, we transform this
intelligence into action.

91
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:05,085
Through interactive dashboards
and reports your team scan spot

92
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:11,085
trends, instantly identify issues
early, make data-driven decisions.

93
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:14,565
The beauty of this
solution is its simplicity.

94
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,635
It's completely automated.

95
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:21,820
Running 24 by seven, taking every customer
interaction into business intelligence.

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,520
No manual processing, no sampling, no
delays, just continuous near real time

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
insights from every customer conversation.

98
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,960
Think of it as giving your organization
a super human, the ability to listen

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,940
to, understand, and act on every
customer interaction simultaneously.

100
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,610
Now, let's build this
architecture using AWS.

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,460
We begin with two types of customer
interactions, voice calls store

102
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,370
does, audio files, and Amazon S3 chat
conversations from your support team.

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,690
For voice calls, we have
built an automated pipeline.

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,360
When a new audio file lands in
S3, it triggers a Lambda function.

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,650
This transcribed Lambda function
calls Amazon transcribe.

106
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,745
The resulting transcript
is sowed in an S3 bucket.

107
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:25,255
Next, we handle both the
transcribed calls and chat logs.

108
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,305
Another S3 activates our
sentiment Lambda function.

109
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:35,520
This function leverages Amazon comprehend,
which goes beyond basic text analysis.

110
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:42,025
Comprehend understands banking context
automatically identifies key topics like

111
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,815
loan applications or account issues.

112
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:49,614
It detects customer sentiment
throughout the conversation, helping

113
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,625
you spot satisfaction trends.

114
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,905
It helps recognize patterns and
customer inquiries, helping you identify

115
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,155
emerging issues before they escalate.

116
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:03,020
The structured analysis is
then stored for further use.

117
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,640
Finally, we make all of these actionable
insights actionable and accessible.

118
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:16,400
Amazon QuickSight transforms this wealth
of data into interactive dashboards

119
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,919
that your teams can actually use.

120
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:25,280
It offers machine learning powered anomaly
detection to automatically flag unusual

121
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,065
patterns and customer interactions.

122
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:32,075
Business users can ask questions
in natural language, no technical

123
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:38,284
skills needed for deeper analysis,
we can use Athena to run SQL queries

124
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,985
directly on the data in the S3 bucket.

125
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:46,905
What's powerful about this
architecture is it is automatic

126
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,515
and then it is near real time.

127
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,435
From the moment a call lands
or a chat closes, the analysis

128
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,324
begins within minutes.

129
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,635
The insights are available
in your dashboards.

130
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:03,045
There's no manual processing,
no delays, and no sampling.

131
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,535
Every interaction is analyzed.

132
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:10,094
This solution gives you a
complete, near real time view

133
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:11,714
of your customer interactions.

134
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,985
You're not just handling
customer service anymore.

135
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:19,515
You're turning every customer conversation
into valuable business intelligence.

136
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,040
Imagine identifying trends and
issues before they become problems,

137
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,650
understanding customer sentiment
across thousands of interactions and

138
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,209
making data-driven decisions based
on actual customer conversations.

139
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,870
Now let's look at a quick live demo.

140
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,710
So I have created this
solution on AWS console.

141
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,300
You can also create it using
infrastructure as code.

142
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,360
So this is how AWS console looks like.

143
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,870
You'll be able to select the
region where you want to deploy

144
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,770
your workloads or your solutions.

145
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,440
So I have used London region here.

146
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,000
And here you'll be able to see
my recently visited AWS services.

147
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,520
You will also be able to navigate
to this by clicking on the links

148
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,220
here, or you'll be able to search a
service here and go to the service.

149
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,700
Or if you click these buttons, you'll be
able to navigate to AWS services as well.

150
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,045
So now let's look at S3.

151
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:27,315
So I have created an S3
bucket within the bucket.

152
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:31,395
I have created these
folders for audio files.

153
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:36,375
This is where I'm gonna upload
the audio file of a chat of a

154
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,505
conversation along with its metadata.

155
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:42,595
So I will just upload an audio file.

156
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:52,015
Here along with its metadata, JSON
file, and this is gonna upload in a

157
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:53,845
fraction of seconds as you can see.

158
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:58,395
Once this is done this event
triggers a lambda function.

159
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:03,915
Lambda function will now call Amazon
Transcribe, which is a transcription

160
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:06,585
service to convert speech to text.

161
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:10,695
So here, if you see there's a
transcription job in progress,

162
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:14,505
but in the interest of time, I'm
gonna show you how it looks like

163
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,695
once the transcription is done.

164
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,595
So here you'll be able to see
the employee details, customer

165
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,935
details, and the transcript.

166
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:28,155
This information will be
stored in another folder of S3

167
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,015
bucket called extracted files.

168
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:35,785
Once this is stored here in this
folder again, a lambda is triggered,

169
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:40,225
which calls Amazon comprehend
sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

170
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:46,015
So if you see, you'll be able to see
that topic modeling job is in progress.

171
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:48,865
So again, in the interest of
time, I'm gonna show you how this,

172
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,485
how the final output looks like.

173
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:54,115
So it looks like this here.

174
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:59,005
So you have employee Id name,
customer ID name, and account type.

175
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,475
You have the transcript.

176
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:05,325
And we have done a sentiment analysis
on this transcript using comprehend.

177
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,875
So it is negative sentiment.

178
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:11,665
Comprehend also gives you a score
such as here it is saying it is

179
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:17,045
99.5% sure that this conversation
has a negative sentiment to it.

180
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:21,125
And for topic modeling, again,
I have selected 10 topics to be

181
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,165
picked up by Amazon comprehend.

182
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:27,905
So you'll be able to see all of those
here and the related terms to each topic.

183
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,185
And if you scroll down, you'll
see the metadata of this file.

184
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,975
So all of this is again, stored into
another bucket of S3 call combined.

185
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,015
So you have all of this here.

186
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,935
Now I am feeding all of this
data into Amazon QuickSight

187
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,465
to create visualizations.

188
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:53,025
So this, these visualizations could be
created based on your requirement but

189
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:57,615
for this demo, I have created few sample
visuals like the one on the screen.

190
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,285
The first one is distribution
of customer sentiment.

191
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:04,845
So we have gotten 61 customer
conversations, either through chat

192
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,615
messages or through audio calls.

193
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:10,185
So I'm showing the sentiment
across these conversations here.

194
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:15,625
Here you'll be able to see the sentiment
distribution across across the account

195
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:20,665
type, such as which account type has a
negative sentiment associated to it, or

196
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,735
a positive sentiment associated to it.

197
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,095
And topic analysis dashboards.

198
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:29,515
I'm gonna show the dominant
topic in customer conversations.

199
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,255
So if you have.

200
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,500
Topics such as account services for
which the customers are calling you

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,430
often, such as how do I open an account,
how do I close an account, et cetera.

202
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,800
You'll be able to look at these
dashboards to maybe create an FAQs

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,010
document so customers can help
themselves rather than calling the

204
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,810
agents at the banking call center.

205
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,010
This way you are reducing the
calls that can be that can

206
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,690
be self-served by customers.

207
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:01,285
And here in customer service performance,
I have created a visual which

208
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:03,175
shows the performance of an agent.

209
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:07,915
So if an agent has a con consistent
negative sentiment while talking

210
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,455
to customers, you'll be able to
put them on a training program.

211
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,295
So you're making the customer,
sub customer experience positive.

212
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,400
Some other features of QuickSight
are you'll be able to connect to

213
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,630
QuickSight from all of these data
sources listed on my screen here and,

214
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,910
you'll be able to create executive
summaries and data stories of these

215
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,810
dashboards, such as executive summary.

216
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm gonna click here.

217
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,660
So this is how you can do it.

218
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,950
And for data stories you'll be
able to create or select visual.

219
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:51,080
So I'm gonna write, create Me
data story for negative sentiment.

220
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:54,275
Then I'm gonna add visuals.

221
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:57,575
I'm going to select
these two click on build.

222
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:02,795
So it's gonna build me a data story based
on the visuals that I have selected.

223
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:09,605
It takes a couple of minutes to run, okay?

224
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,855
So here you'll be able to change
the format styles of the story

225
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,865
based on your requirement.

226
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:20,685
And here it gives you a good introduction.

227
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,300
A story for each visual, and at
the end it also gives you things

228
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,220
like these and also a conclusion.

229
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,660
So I think it's good for the people who
are reporting to the leadership at the end

230
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,490
of a quarter or at the end of the month.

231
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,200
It's quite handy for them.

232
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,430
Now, let me explain why
our architecture's, modern

233
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,930
design makes it so powerful.

234
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:43,205
It.

235
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:48,185
Our solution is completely event driven,
which means when a new call recording

236
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:53,705
occurs or arrives in an S3 bucket,
it automatically triggers analysis.

237
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:58,265
When chat conversations end,
they immediately get processed.

238
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,475
No scheduling, no batching, no delays.

239
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:07,325
Think of it as having an incredibly
efficient assembly line that

240
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,215
starts working the moment.

241
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,475
New information arrives.

242
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:15,645
And being serverless transforms
how we deliver the solution.

243
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,945
There's no infrastructure for
you to manage or maintain.

244
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,065
The system automatically
scales with your volume.

245
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,535
Whether you're processing hundred
or thousands of conversations, you

246
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,505
only pay for actual processing time.

247
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,005
No idle resources.

248
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,760
And this architecture
delivers three key advantages.

249
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,610
Speed analysis starts instantly
when conversations end efficiency.

250
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,750
Resources are used only when
needed Cost effectiveness.

251
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,820
You only pay for what you process.

252
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,650
And what does it mean
to you as a business?

253
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,710
There's no capacity planning needed, no
infrastructure management, no upfront

254
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:04,560
cost, automatically scaling during busy
periods, and cost optimizations built in.

255
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:11,160
Built in these modern approaches ensure
you're always ready to handle customer

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,350
interactions, whether it's a quiet Sunday
morning or your busiest hour on a Monday.

257
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,260
And security is fundamental
to this architecture.

258
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,090
Let me show you how we protect
your customer data at every level.

259
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,920
Data protection.

260
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,010
Everything starts with
comprehensive data protection.

261
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,560
All customer data is stored in S3 and
which is automatically encrypted at rest.

262
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,220
Every transmission between
services is encrypted.

263
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,275
We use A-W-S-K-M-S for secure key
management give you, giving you complete

264
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,275
control over your encryption keys.

265
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:51,435
Access control.

266
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,835
We implement certain access controls.

267
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:57,765
Each component operates
with specific IAM roles.

268
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:01,215
Lambda functions have
precisely defined permissions.

269
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:05,385
No service has more access
than it absolutely needs.

270
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:09,590
Think of it as each component
having its own security badge.

271
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,210
With every specific access, right?

272
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,820
Compliance features for
banking compliance, transcribe

273
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,020
automatically identifies and can
redirect sensitive information.

274
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,270
Every action is logged in
CloudTrail for audit purposes.

275
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,420
We maintain continuous
compliance monitoring.

276
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,030
This ensures you know exactly what's
happening with your data at all times

277
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,690
and coming to infrastructure security.

278
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:44,895
At the infrastructure level,
services run in your VPC network

279
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,755
access is tightly controlled.

280
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:53,235
Continuous security monitoring alerts
you to any unusual activity, and

281
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:56,745
the beauty of this design is that
security isn't an afterthought.

282
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,195
It's built into every
component and interaction.

283
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:05,835
You get enterprise grade security
automatically helping you maintain

284
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:09,255
compliance while protecting your
customer's sensitive information.

285
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,640
Now let's wrap up what
we have covered today.

286
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,010
You have seen how this solution
automatically analyzes every customer

287
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,080
interaction, delivers near real
time insights for calls and chats.

288
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,760
Securely scales with your
needs, turns customer feedback

289
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,170
into actionable intelligence.

290
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,930
And in the demo, you have seen how this
works in practice from conversation

291
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,870
to insight in minutes, not taste.

292
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,830
And this isn't just about better
analytics, it is also about

293
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,185
understanding your customers better,
solving problems before they escalate,

294
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,225
making informed decisions based on.

295
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,160
Real data staying ahead in
competitive banking environment.

296
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,720
The question isn't whether you need
these insights, it's how quickly you

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,760
want to start benefiting from them.

298
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,160
Thanks for staying with me till here.

299
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,340
I would love to connect with
you, so please feel free to

300
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,110
connect with me on LinkedIn.

301
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,270
Thanks so much.

302
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,420
Bye.
