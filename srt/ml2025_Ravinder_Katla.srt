00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,810
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Ravinder.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,969
Today I'm going to discuss about the
driving sustainability environmental

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,240
benefits of our efficient power
molding in vehicle software.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,290
So today I'm going to a little
bit about the, how the vehicles

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,420
are using the power in both
electrical and convention vehicles.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,070
Hope you will enjoy the content.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,030
Let's get started.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,030
Start with me.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,040
I'm a one of the top automotive
industry in General Motors as

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,130
an advanced entertainment system
engineer, Christian engineer.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
I was working in past 12 years in
in the same automotive field but

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,570
the different different backgrounds
embedded software engineer and then

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,080
firmware engineer, and then integration
engineer, entertainment engineer.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,770
Different roles.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,470
But but all are in automotive industry.

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,105
Let's get into that details and
then, let's get into the poor

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,020
poor management system and yeah.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,320
Sure.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,070
First thing, let's talk
about the basic things.

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,735
In in vehicle means
there are so many issues.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,220
Issues means electronics control unit.

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,290
So each electronic control unit
manages particular function.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,900
So let's suppose body control model.

25
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:15,665
It operates like, it's to maintain the
lighting and then break and then, the.

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,305
And the the body related things
it controls those things.

27
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:24,565
And then there are couple of, there
are around like, 16 to 32 eecs

28
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,965
in the in particular car, depends
upon the vehicle manufacturer.

29
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:35,305
Each ECU is operating differently, like
one ECU is using less power one use one.

30
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:38,145
Like other EC needs a
constant requirement.

31
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:42,050
Power to operate it, the
operated or perform the actions.

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,330
In order to con, in order to reduce
the power and then we need to minimize

33
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,670
those power consumption each ECU.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,910
And we will talk about more
into the coming slides.

35
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,560
But yeah, that is the basic thing.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,930
And then the battery life cycle.

37
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,680
So inefficient power molding
power management leads to

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,430
a shorter battery life.

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,090
You like, when you charge the
vehicle, it it was like, two 80

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,090
miles, but in the next day without
driving your car, but your battery.

41
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:17,345
Got shorter to a two 70 next day because
of you don't know what happens, what with

42
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,765
the difference because of, there are so
many operations running on the background.

43
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,105
So these are the issues.

44
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:27,405
Consume the power and then
run the background things.

45
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,015
And then there is another
thing is different power state.

46
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:36,125
We are guy we are we are going to discuss
the, in the propulsion and then run

47
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:40,285
and sleep and then, different different
power modes we are going to talk about.

48
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,485
And then how the.

49
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,190
Different acs, electronic control
units are using when you are,

50
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:47,720
when the vehicle is in sleep.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,160
So we will get into these details.

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,200
These are the basic things we'll
get more into depth into the things.

53
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,490
Yeah.

54
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,220
So how the power molding works.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,590
So the first question is
how the power molding works.

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,790
So power molding means there are different
kinds of power mode so whether power is

57
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,130
using the battery when you are driving
that is power used by your regular usage

58
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,010
and then the vehicle is sleeping, sleep.

59
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,570
When you are parked in your garage
garage and then vehicle is no longer

60
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,415
using, but still using the power.

61
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:26,305
That's the problem with that with
the electronic control units.

62
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:30,325
So they are constantly require
power to operate internally.

63
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:34,865
So that's where the power molding has
any different kinds like, whether it's

64
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:39,995
operated in sleep mode, operated in a
run mode, operated in a propulsion mode.

65
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,605
Propulsion means when you are
driving that is the propulsion.

66
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,105
So there are a couple of things.

67
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:50,055
So environmental sensing and then real
time analysis and dynamic adjustment,

68
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,335
and then continuous optimization.

69
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:56,440
So these are the four steps
we need to we need to discuss.

70
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:59,265
First thing is environmental sensing.

71
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:05,505
Vehicle systems monitor usage patterns,
driver behavior, and then environmental

72
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,275
conditions based on that one.

73
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:10,555
The power mode got adjusted.

74
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,435
When you are like, drive the vehicle to.

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,430
To speed too accelerated, too a
accelerated too frequently or then

76
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,320
the power consumption gonna be high.

77
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,350
And then based on your driving behavior,
the power consumption got changed.

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,615
And then there is an real time analysis.

79
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,035
How your how your vehicle is operated
different power states each component

80
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:37,495
which each component using the
how much power in the real time.

81
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,565
When you got the data from the
vehicle and then you'll analyze.

82
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,615
That is the second step.

83
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:45,104
And then third step is dynamic adjustment.

84
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:49,544
Once you got the data, once you
driver behavior, and then you know,

85
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:53,414
environment, condition of the vehicle,
and then you got any real time data

86
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,915
of that power power power molding.

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,570
After that vehicle and then you can
adjust the ECU or ECU EU Power a CU,

88
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,649
power between the two different issues
are like, how much power using when

89
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,654
you, when the vehicle is slipped,
so you can adjust based on that one.

90
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:15,034
And then the fourth step
is continuous optimization.

91
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:19,195
Once you are done with that all
this real time analysis and dynamic

92
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:23,784
adjustment, then the last step is
how the how to reduce your power.

93
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,565
Maximize the efficiency.

94
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,275
So that is the fourth step.

95
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,075
You need to be we need
to be work on that one.

96
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:34,095
So let's talk about the
quantity, quantifiable benefits

97
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,175
of electrical vehicles.

98
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:39,835
So nowadays so many vehicles are
in vehicles are using the battery.

99
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,245
Battery power.

100
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:47,289
If some manufacturers are like, hey we are
like, 500 miles per full charge but that

101
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,049
doesn't mean like it's 400 miles drive.

102
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,309
See the drive drive straight
because of there are so many

103
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,809
functions running on the background.

104
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,214
Let's suppose HVAC.

105
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,154
The AC and the heat.

106
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:03,124
So when you are turning on the ac,
the battery gonna be, reduced to

107
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,334
five percentage, two percentage
based on your driving behavior.

108
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:09,584
So let's talk about the
quantifiable benefits.

109
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:12,424
So first thing is energy efficiency gain.

110
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,534
Overall consumption of the power.

111
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:18,454
How the power you have an a
hundred percent discharge then

112
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:22,564
energy efficiency gain means how
your power consumption is going.

113
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:27,684
With your behavior, driving behavior,
and then range extension increase the

114
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:32,784
driving range in when you are driving in
a highway or without breaks or with breaks

115
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,104
or you are a sudden increase the speed.

116
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:39,040
So that is also your your power
management guard adjusted.

117
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,500
And then third one is battery lifespan.

118
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,450
Like most of the manufacturer are
suggesting 80% is of charge because of,

119
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,180
if you charge a hundred percentage every
time, the battery gonna be depleted.

120
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,754
And then so the power molding
is you want to maximize maximum

121
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,284
extension of battery life.

122
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,904
That's the goal of this one.

123
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:02,054
And then and then the
driver gonna be enjoy.

124
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,524
And then long, long drivers.

125
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:09,444
So that's the basic thing to
of the power molding model.

126
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:12,424
So let's talk about the impact
on the convention vehicle.

127
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,199
So in the previous slide we were talking
about the electrical vehicles, and then

128
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,089
now we are talking about the convention
vehicles, how the conventional vehicles

129
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,974
are, independent of the battery.

130
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,689
So when you fill fill the gas and
then, you, you need to be care care

131
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,354
about the fuel consumption, and then
CT emissions, and then the component

132
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,904
lifespan and then maintenance intervals.

133
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:37,314
So these are the things you need to be
con consider on the convention vehicles.

134
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:43,644
In the fuel consumption reduce reduction
of two to four percentage and savings up

135
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:46,954
to one 10 kg of CO2 annual labor vehicle.

136
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:50,184
So with the power consumption,
because of, if you are using the,

137
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:53,889
too much of power molding power
molding means too much of power in the

138
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,439
vehicle, so you need to burn the gas.

139
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:56,849
Hi.

140
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,799
So that's, that is another thing.

141
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,929
And then environmental impact.

142
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:06,709
So what are the environmental benefits
when you when you are working on the power

143
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,179
molding model or like in a power molding?

144
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,539
Reduce the power molding, in the vehicle.

145
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:16,809
So the direct emission reduction, like
the first thing is you you reduce the

146
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,849
fuel consumption, that is the first thing.

147
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,979
And the more more efficient
operations in the vehicle.

148
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:27,849
And then extended component life
cycles you reduce the re reduce the

149
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,829
battery, you reduce the power and
then increase the battery lifespan.

150
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:35,879
And then the battery the battery
gonna be sufficient for your needs.

151
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,329
And then manufacturing footprint
fuel replacement parts needed

152
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:41,349
throughout the vehicle.

153
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:41,469
Life.

154
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,784
Because of, you are reducing
the less power of the vehicle.

155
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:49,964
And then vehicle is vehicle is more
sufficient and then efficiently run

156
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:56,599
pro your vehicle life and then resource
consumption, lower demand after raw

157
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,059
materials and in battery production.

158
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,634
So the you are ultimately you are
saving the battery and as well

159
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:05,914
as the battery raw materials.

160
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,814
So that is the another
benefit of this power moving.

161
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:11,124
So implementation.

162
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:15,589
In the previous slides we were talking
about the how the bad electrical EVs

163
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:18,919
EVs are doing, and then convention
vehicles are doing, and then now

164
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,379
talking about the implementation, how.

165
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:25,674
We are going to implement
this power molding with the

166
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,084
efficient power mold model.

167
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,784
So first thing is vehicle preparation.

168
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:34,174
So software updates are updates
installed across around five

169
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:36,184
or fleet test fleet vehicles.

170
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,054
So that is test fleet vehicles.

171
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,724
And then, eU from their upgrades.

172
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:43,204
So these are the different
power consumption.

173
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:47,019
Power consumption when you, when
the vehicle is sleep when there

174
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,219
is an O OT upgrade or the air
update from the manufacturer.

175
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,969
But you don't want to install
right away when you are driving,

176
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,889
but you but the vehicle needs.

177
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:58,524
That is a critical update.

178
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,444
You need to update it as soon as possible.

179
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:05,124
Then the only way is during
vehicle sleep vehicle sleep, the

180
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,279
automatically trigger that update,
and then it automatically updated.

181
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,489
And then the third one is, the
second one is up EC ware upgrades.

182
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:17,659
When the ECU needs a critical update
update for your functionality, for

183
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,429
your safety, or for the infotainment
changes or anything any major

184
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:27,449
changes the manufacturer send it or
their update to upgrade your ware.

185
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,984
That needs to be power as well,
like for when the vehicle is asleep.

186
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,299
And then the power management
protocol integration.

187
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:38,509
So that is the that is the another
one, the third one when the when

188
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:43,099
the power is consumption by the
vehicle, when the vehicle is in sleep.

189
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,839
So we need to monitor that one.

190
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,099
So that is another one.

191
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:51,119
And then so algorithm algorithm
optimization based on the fleet data.

192
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,619
And then driving pattern recognition
and environmental adoption.

193
00:10:55,859 --> 00:11:01,399
So these are the implementation
of refinement of the per mode and

194
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,244
then the monitoring pre period.

195
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:07,394
How long you gonna be monitored this,
power mode let's suppose collect the

196
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:12,954
data for 12 months of data and then
check the data, how, which issues

197
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:16,344
are con, con consuming more power.

198
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:20,184
And then after that you get
the data and then you get the

199
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:21,654
regular checks and everything.

200
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,994
And then you need to verify the data.

201
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:29,404
The comprehensive performance analysis
and then energy conjunction patterns.

202
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:34,809
You get all the components and then you
will, you'll find out like, what need

203
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,109
to be improved, what is you consume?

204
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:42,874
The more power which way we
need to reduce that power that.

205
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,064
That, that is this case study.

206
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,714
The case study is completed.

207
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,114
Then the technical
implementation challenges.

208
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:55,084
So once you got the data and then
and then you have an everything

209
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,904
what you are supposed to do.

210
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:00,694
So first thing is system
integration complexity.

211
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:04,229
So in in the first slide we were
talking and we were talking.

212
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:09,699
Talking about so the vehicle means
there are so many number of eec each

213
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,649
ECU perform different operations.

214
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,589
So each ECU communicated with
the different EC as well.

215
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:20,834
And then so creating a unified power
mode model is very difficult because

216
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,854
of, one ECU consume less power.

217
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:28,019
Another ECU consume more power
because de depends upon their usage.

218
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,054
And then, and then cross function
cross platform compatibility.

219
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:37,674
How the, whether the EECS is need to be
interacted with outside of the world.

220
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:41,734
Let's suppose telecommunication model
needs to be interacted with career

221
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:48,184
servers and like an at t. And then
the each e issue has a different

222
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,734
suppliers are like, different mechanism.

223
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,889
So we need to coordinate that.

224
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:55,304
That is the first one.

225
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:57,374
And then safety critical system.

226
00:12:57,374 --> 00:13:01,819
So some of the critical safety critical
system when the vehicle is theft, so

227
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:08,214
you need to be the the, that particular
issue need to be a awake during the

228
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:12,574
safety critical operations or when the
accident happens though, or when the

229
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:18,519
when the, when somebody o open the,
your drawer when you are not there.

230
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:23,729
So those kind of situations the
particular you needs to be very active

231
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,439
and then need to be triggered The.

232
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,119
Safety alarms.

233
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,699
And then as well as the, you need to
be A-S-O-I-S-O 2 6 2 6 2 functional

234
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,769
safety standard must be maintained.

235
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:38,974
So these are the functional main
maintain, you need to be maintained.

236
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,354
And then legacy.

237
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,714
Hardware constraints.

238
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:45,804
Older vehicle platforms may lack
of lack the necessary hardware to

239
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:48,114
support and advance power states.

240
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:52,984
And retrofit, retrofitting capabilities
and request careful hardware

241
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:56,584
software code design may increase
the initial implementation costs.

242
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,529
So these are the technical challenges.

243
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:03,019
So we were facing, standards
and industry collaboration.

244
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,519
So this is another thing.

245
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:09,549
So what so there are the
functional safety ISO requirement.

246
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,259
That is a 2 6 2 6 2.

247
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,419
Establish the safety requirements
for both electrical and convention

248
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,639
vehicles in the automobile, ensuring
the power moving transition to don't

249
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,229
compromise their critical function.

250
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,464
Just we were discussing like,
when the vehicle is theft or

251
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,974
when the vehicle is not located
like, somebody stole the vehicle.

252
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,789
You need to be you need
the particular issue.

253
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,534
You need to be active
every, each and every time.

254
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:40,034
When the vehicle is also slipped,
that is the 2 6 2 6 2 functional

255
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,684
safety requirement assist.

256
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:44,904
And then the, another
thing is partnership.

257
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:48,744
Standardizes the software architecture
for the ECU Port management.

258
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:54,124
When you designing the designing the ECU,
you need to be care about the, how the.

259
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:59,884
How the ECUs are functioning, and then
how the ECU power molding are designing.

260
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:02,514
That need to be discussed earlier.

261
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:06,284
And then you need to be enabling
the inter interability between the

262
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:08,344
different manufacturer and suppliers.

263
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:12,304
Manufacturing suppliers need to be
a partner partnership to understand

264
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:16,504
the understand the requirements of
that particular power molding and

265
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:20,724
then as well as the how this whether
you need to be compromised or not.

266
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:24,414
Based on the functions they
perform that particular issue.

267
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,834
And then the another one
is cybersecurity standard.

268
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:33,044
So cybersecurity is unauthorized control
of that vehicle or prevent unauthorized

269
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:36,584
usage of that vehicle or security concern.

270
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:42,224
So those are the things you need to be
aware you need to be active every time.

271
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,384
So those are the
cybersecurity requirements.

272
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,824
And then you need to be.

273
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,439
Every time must be on.

274
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,529
And then cross industry working groups,
collaborative efforts between the

275
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,059
automotives and semiconductor and software
industries to develop next next generation

276
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,819
for next generation management solution.

277
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:04,669
These are the these are the
one we need to be focused on.

278
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:08,659
So these are the different kind
of industry collaboration things.

279
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:09,729
We are working on that.

280
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:13,339
And then future
opportunities and directions.

281
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:18,909
So current power mode model discrete power
states based on the predefined conditions.

282
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,794
And then the next phase gonna
be a driven optimization.

283
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,324
A looking into that power
power management thing.

284
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,959
And then see that, okay, this this
is, you can consume more power.

285
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,719
Why, if it is, if this is necessary, yes.

286
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,389
If it is necessary, yes,
you can use that power.

287
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:39,469
If it is not necessary, then
stop that ECU to use the power

288
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:40,879
and then shut down that ECU.

289
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:43,599
This is the next level
of a driven optimization.

290
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,574
And then V two X vehicle
to other vehicle to charge.

291
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:48,734
Vehicle to vehicle.

292
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,589
So these are the vehicle to x integration,
poor management control with the

293
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,569
infrastructure and other vehicles.

294
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,299
So these are the next level, and
then distributed in intelligence.

295
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,239
So autonomous power decisions at
individual or component level whether

296
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:11,824
the the issue decide itself whether I
need to be wake up or sleep or like you

297
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:15,584
don't use the power is this necessary
operation to perform right now.

298
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:21,134
Yes or no, based on the decision,
it auto autonomously taking the

299
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:26,984
decision by the ECU and based on your
program, it automatically change the

300
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,534
change the power model condition.

301
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:29,654
So the.

302
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,694
The final take key
takeaways and next steps.

303
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:39,124
So the first thing is
significant environmental impact.

304
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:44,034
So when the power management is
properly properly organized or

305
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:47,574
properly maintained in the software
level, vehicle software level.

306
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:50,544
So you need to be environmental the.

307
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,109
The vehicle is environmentally benefited.

308
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,699
And then a power molding delivers
miserable emissions reductions

309
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,309
resource con conservation across both
electrical and conventional platform.

310
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,269
With the potential and exp exponential
impact when the applied rate scale you are

311
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,359
produce millions of vehicles each year.

312
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,054
But you need to be.

313
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:16,514
More careful carefully about the
power moving because of, each vehicle

314
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:21,864
consumption vehicle con power consumption
with impact, so many emissions.

315
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,724
So that is the first step.

316
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,544
And then a software
driven solution so that.

317
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:28,384
That's where we are working on that.

318
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:32,494
Unlike hardware based efficiency
improvements, power Moding leverages

319
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:35,644
a software innovation that can
be deployed rapidly across the

320
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:40,514
existing vehicle platforms through
updates and providing immediate

321
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:44,704
sustainable benefits like, whether the
particular software, particular VCs,

322
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:50,774
consumption more so why it is more
then you need to be we need to be no.

323
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,489
Software that capable whether
the it is necessary use, use that

324
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,069
particular particular operation.

325
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:01,069
Yes, if it is necessary,
then use that power.

326
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:05,790
Otherwise just stop it and then just
don't use the power and then are

327
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,531
like, low or more just too minimal.

328
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:11,781
Power using our, so that's
the software driven solution.

329
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,641
And then industry standardization.

330
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:17,831
And then the advanced standardized
approach to power management will

331
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:21,031
accelerate the adoption of and
maximum environmental benefits

332
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,391
across all the automotive industries.

333
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:27,796
Require, continue continuing the
collaboration between the manufacturer,

334
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:30,526
suppliers and then regulatory bodies.

335
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,166
So these are the steps.

336
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,336
