1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,630
Good day, everybody, and welcome
to the show, where today I'd like

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,660
to talk to you about why people and
not yet another tool hold the key

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,470
to success in the tech industry.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,339
So my goal today is to shift your
awareness towards a bit of a more non

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,919
technical field, because let's face
it, we're all pretty good at coding.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,419
that alone won't make
you stand out anymore.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,150
So I'd like to talk to you a bit
about the topic of skills beyond

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,920
code, which is let's say, So a mix
of soft skills, human skills, and

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,760
social hacks in the technical sector.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,280
And, stay tuned, guys, because
you're gonna see that there's a lot

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,539
of untapped potential in that area.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,430
let's go.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,999
A short introduction about myself.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,560
My name is Pierre Luigi Meloni, or GG.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,560
And as you can hear from
my name, I'm from, Germany.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,789
Yeah, schnitzel und sauerkraut.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,700
I studied computer science and I made
my master in computer science, and I've

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,240
been in the tech industry for more than
20 years already, in the most various

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,080
jobs, most of the time in engineering,
and I had the opportunity to work with

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,059
very clever and interesting people, and
they taught me a lot, which you're going

21
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,419
to see throughout this presentation.

22
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,845
I am the founder and CEO of other
skills, which is an e learning academy,

23
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:19,885
especially for, tech specialists,
for the sector of skills beyond code.

24
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:24,084
when I started out, in my career,
pretty much like you, I guess

25
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,764
I fell in love with coding.

26
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,685
So that was the first thing,
even before I started studying.

27
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:32,265
And what I always wanted to do is, of
course, I wanted to build cool stuff.

28
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:32,855
Why not?

29
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:34,225
I love technology.

30
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,705
To be honest, I also
wanted to have a good time.

31
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:41,315
Because, I guess everyone of you knows if
you had to earn some money during study,

32
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:43,365
you had to do the most various jobs.

33
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:46,074
And I was in factories
and stuff like that.

34
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,124
And, The tech industry was promising.

35
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,374
They had like more comfortable
jobs, let's say it like that.

36
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:54,634
And of course, I wouldn't go as far
and say that I wanted to change the

37
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,514
world, but at least, I wanted to impact.

38
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:58,204
I wanted to influence the stuff.

39
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:01,235
I wanted to, get my ideas
heard and change something.

40
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,565
But then what happens?

41
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:06,295
You start going to companies,
you arrive in the industry.

42
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:09,165
And the first thing is you got
to deal with demanding customers.

43
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:12,765
And sometimes they want to, they
want you to produce stuff that

44
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,825
you really don't agree with.

45
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,695
And you're like, it's really not the best
solution, but you got to do it anyway.

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,200
Then you hit hierarchies and politics.

47
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,270
You find out that it's actually not
that easy to get thoughts through

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,520
and that stuff, that you got to use
your elbows from time to time even.

49
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,140
And the worst thing of all, you're
actually working with legacy more

50
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,360
often than you would want to.

51
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,360
Actually in our industry, more
of the time you are bug fixing,

52
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,770
maintaining, refactoring stuff instead
of building things from scratch.

53
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,840
And that it's Different than you would
have originally dreamed about the job.

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,210
what do you do when you continue
working somehow, like most people do?

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,450
You switch your focus.

56
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,970
You think about, okay, then
I want to earn more money.

57
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,590
I want to climb up the ranks.

58
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,290
I want to become a senior faster.

59
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,770
But still, inside of you,
that desire is still there.

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,090
You still want to influence
stuff, especially in your team

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,860
with the line management, with
the roadmaps and stuff like that.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,130
You want to be heard.

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,850
You want your work to be seen.

64
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,980
You want it to be valued.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,870
And most and foremost, at least it was for
me the way I wanted to do things right.

66
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,190
I want to do the right things
and I wanted to do things right.

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,280
And the problem in the tech world is
if you don't listen to the experts.

68
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,450
That means if experts do not have the
influence they should have, they're not

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,550
really heard and things are not done
right, what happens is technical debt

70
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,590
increases, efficiency of projects goes
down, the complexity rises over the time.

71
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,690
But the problem for us is we got
to work with that on a daily basis.

72
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,770
And the bad thing is if if you have
this feeling that you thought I

73
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,340
knew it before and I knew it better,
but I couldn't get them to believe.

74
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,000
And now we're in that situation and
everybody thinks yeah, it's your problem.

75
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,750
You built it.

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,050
And this really was
always a problem for me.

77
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,290
And that got tiring for me.

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,810
But then you realize, ah, no, excuse
me, what do you do then is, because

79
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,130
you want to change the situation.

80
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,530
What you do, you go to conferences
like these, for example, and

81
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,570
you look how the others do it.

82
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,200
And of course, most of the time you hear
like success stories and especially you

83
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
want to learn how the big companies do it.

84
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,740
So you look at all the methodologies
and all the theory behind it.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
You learn how agile is done.

86
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,330
You start thinking, yeah, my
company might need a tribe.

87
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,900
We got to do it the
lean way and whatsoever.

88
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,530
And then of course, like 95
percent of all presentations and

89
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,470
conferences, they're about tech.

90
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,210
ah, they're using this disruptive
technology and everybody treats technology

91
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,630
as the problem and the solution,
which already is strange, right?

92
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,190
So you see how they do
it, how you should do it.

93
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,070
You start taking the stuff
in, into your company and

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,160
whatever, but what's the result?

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,840
Some things might get better, but most of
the time, does influence really increase?

96
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,420
Do you do things right?

97
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,180
are you being heard from now on?

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,390
Are you being seen as the expert?

99
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,010
Most of the time, not really.

100
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,230
And this is not the
only experience I have.

101
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,250
I guess many of you
can share that feeling.

102
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,800
And I saw it in so many companies.

103
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,950
I've been working in a couple of companies
and I've been consulted in many companies.

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,280
And that's really like a
common problem that I see.

105
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,350
Thank you.

106
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,420
And what I realized, the longer
you work in a company, that there's

107
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,860
always a certain type of person.

108
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,860
Sometimes it's a consultant,
sometimes it's a team member,

109
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,660
sometimes it's just a line manager.

110
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,430
Some people who have technical
expertise, but some are not, let's

111
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,010
say the brightest minds in the room.

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,750
But somehow they just know
how to talk and to sell.

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,960
I call them the sellosophers
or the noisecutives.

114
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,660
Really strong with bam,
buzzword machinery.

115
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,210
And they are somehow able
to influence management.

116
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,080
And they're also somehow able to fly
up the career ranks just like that.

117
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,430
And you sit there and you'd be like,
damn, I've been here for like forever.

118
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,200
Hardly anybody knows the
application better than me.

119
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,730
And now I get another boss who, where
I experienced knows less than me.

120
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,240
Technically, and this is
at least a tech company.

121
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,830
But there's this weird relation that,
that people are hurt that I just,

122
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,860
I don't know, louder or whatsoever.

123
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,380
And, Yeah, that's a strange thing.

124
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,410
at a certain point, this happened
to me early in, in companies.

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,990
It changed later on, but
I'm going to get to that.

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,670
But at a certain point, you're
going to make a cut in your career.

127
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,639
And you think about how it's going to be,
is it going to be tiresome all the time?

128
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,900
Of course, not all the time, but will I
run into these issues over and over again?

129
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,739
Or do I, at a certain point have to become
like, I don't know, like one of them?

130
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,879
So that was a hard thing to think about.

131
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,669
But then one day, there
was another consultant.

132
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,769
Actually, to tell you the story, I was
working at a company that made clinical

133
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,509
research, and I was a software engineer.

134
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,259
And, we had really some legacy,
technology, and this is why we had

135
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,009
consultants from time to time come in.

136
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,859
And there was, let's say,
yet another one that came in.

137
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,159
So history kept repeating and repeating.

138
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,749
But this time, there was another guy.

139
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,629
I remember that guy particularly
because, he was different.

140
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,109
His name was Steven, by the way.

141
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:18,189
And to put it bluntly, I would say
that he felt like he was one of us.

142
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,189
Actually, it was very calm and real.

143
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,939
So no buzz wording at all.

144
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,289
He was a real tech expert.

145
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,499
So he was a beast, I have to say.

146
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,179
And with us, he was nerdy, which is cool.

147
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,330
But I'm saying that because I've
never seen like a nerdy guy in the

148
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,229
management meetings having like
influence and telling them what to do.

149
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,039
But he did.

150
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,489
He was able to influence management
and get, let's say, get the right

151
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,239
things done, at least what we thought.

152
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:49,089
And, he was able to get the
change done that we didn't.

153
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,369
And, I remember a story one day.

154
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,894
I gave a presentation
in front of the team.

155
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,334
I had a great idea.

156
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,584
I remember the idea came to me at night.

157
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:58,974
Those are always the best ideas.

158
00:07:59,354 --> 00:07:59,784
And I got up.

159
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:00,894
It was about refactoring.

160
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,824
It was a biggie actually, but
I had a great strategy in mind

161
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:05,154
and I presented it to the team.

162
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:08,674
And, like everyone loved it and they
were like, thumbs up, really good.

163
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:09,624
Yeah, we got to do that.

164
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,224
But it's a bigger one.

165
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:15,284
So you got to present it to management
as well because they have to, to seal it.

166
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,199
If it's good.

167
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,409
And I was like, yeah, great.

168
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,159
I take the presentation and I'm
going to show it to management,

169
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,009
made a date and stuff like that.

170
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,219
And then Steven found out about it.

171
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,029
He came to me, he checked the
presentation and he told me, don't do it.

172
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,779
And it was like, what?

173
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,400
What problem do you have?

174
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,820
And he was like, no,
postpone the presentation.

175
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,080
So get more time and you got to
change it because the way you're

176
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,539
going to do it, it's He said, it's
like giving a present, a presentation

177
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,990
in Chinese to an Italian audience.

178
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,579
They're probably not
gonna understand anything.

179
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,060
And what he said, you do this.

180
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,270
First of all, you got
to know your audience.

181
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,600
that means get into their heads.

182
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,590
Think about the KPIs, the key
performance indicators they have.

183
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,495
What are they expecting?

184
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,845
What are they looking for?

185
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,565
What are they not expecting?

186
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,475
And what do they don't want to hear?

187
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,475
What don't they need to hear?

188
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:10,945
And what might bore them?

189
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,214
Second, use their language.

190
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:18,535
Take imagery, take analogies and
that stuff from their domain.

191
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:22,605
So make it understandable for
them, make it relatable for them.

192
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:27,465
And the third tip, and that this is
one of the best I've ever gotten, was,

193
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:31,014
When you tell something like this, I
know we engineers, we tend to speak

194
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:34,014
about the solution and how great
the solution is and go into details.

195
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,274
And he said, do not
talk about the solution.

196
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:40,984
Make them understand the problem
and make them understand the,

197
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,225
the benefits of your solution.

198
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,124
that is a pretty different thing.

199
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,605
because, when you want to be
seen as the expert, no one should

200
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:51,015
tell you how you do your job.

201
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,345
It's okay if it's a black box.

202
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:56,055
If somebody understand that there's
a need, that there's problem and

203
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:59,615
that you have whatever magic solution
that is okay because you as an

204
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,865
expert say, yeah, that's the thing.

205
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:01,975
That's what I'm getting paid for.

206
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,715
And this is the benefit you have.

207
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,225
People are going to be happy, especially
when you present to management

208
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:12,255
because what are they interested
in numbers, facts, risk assessment.

209
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:15,845
Maybe, some money assessment
as well and all that stuff.

210
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:20,895
So this was a great tip he gave me, but
we're going into that a bit later as well.

211
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,775
And, yeah, so I did, I
prepared it that way.

212
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,995
It was the first time I didn't
know if it was okay or not.

213
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,845
But yeah, I had many presentations
before, but that was the first time I

214
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:35,145
went into a presentation with management
and I thought like, that was a success.

215
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:35,425
Thanks.

216
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,190
They got me, it was like interesting.

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
We had a nice conversation.

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,460
I could see in their eyes and they were
like, hey, that's a really good thing.

219
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,930
And I swear to God, it was the first
time the CEO got up and even applauded.

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,390
And he was like, see that?

221
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,630
That's the effort guys.

222
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,820
And I was like, yeah, hell, why not?

223
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,920
Cool, cool stuff.

224
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,320
But the best thing about it is this was
my aha moment where I realized, damn,

225
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,560
he can do it and I could do it as well.

226
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,949
And there was no magic behind it.

227
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,110
And then I thought about.

228
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,855
what he was really doing.

229
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,885
Because in the beginning, when I
thought about Steven, and I saw

230
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,885
his work of thorn like a case,
maybe just a magician, magical guy

231
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:12,665
who's I don't know, super empathic.

232
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,255
Or maybe it's just because he's old.

233
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:18,935
And I don't know, privileged,
and he's from extern.

234
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,845
So this is why they listen to him.

235
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,475
But that's really not the case.

236
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:28,745
Everything the guy had was like he
had a bucket full of clever hacks.

237
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:34,705
He had I don't know, let's say,
like a magic playbook of wisdom

238
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,545
for pretty much every situation.

239
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:39,015
Not only in the management
meetings, but also internal.

240
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,935
When you're talking to the team and that
stuff and how you prepare stuff and even,

241
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:47,405
when you go into technical decisions, he
just had, these little efficient hacks.

242
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:50,955
And I found out by watching him, I
don't know if he, he saw it that way

243
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:55,755
too, but that was the pattern I saw
that every hack he had was algorithmic.

244
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,785
It's take this playbook
and do it like that.

245
00:11:58,415 --> 00:11:59,085
And guess what?

246
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:01,635
As an IT engineer, what are we good with?

247
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:02,935
Algorithms.

248
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:07,815
So if you break down the hacks in that
form, it's like everybody can do it.

249
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,695
So I started watching him and I
started noticing and I even watched

250
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:14,545
other people who did stuff like,
or at least where I thought they

251
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:15,945
had a good approach to things.

252
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:19,335
I wrote it down and I
started using that stuff.

253
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:24,815
And I tell you friends, that was a turning
point in my career, not only for, success

254
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:26,815
inside teams and what results we had.

255
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,270
Also, especially it was an ignition
for, Let's say, the guys I explained

256
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,310
before, the guys who seem to fly up the
ladders and I somehow found the turbo

257
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,430
how that works, but with a good feeling
because I wasn't buzz wording out.

258
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,470
So what happened is my influence level
grew and especially my trust level grew.

259
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,360
People saw me as an expert,
especially as a go to expert.

260
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,370
And that's a, that's an important thing.

261
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,015
We're all kind of experts, but the go
to expert is the guy you go to when you

262
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:58,570
need if you want to know something or
if you want to put somebody in charge.

263
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,040
And somehow among a group of experts
somebody shines out and this is

264
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,610
what happened from that moment on.

265
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,250
And of course I became, because
it's all social stuff, I

266
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,550
became a better team player.

267
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,800
And better team player means better team.

268
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,300
And better team means better results.

269
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,460
And that was really satisfying.

270
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,410
I got to tell you that.

271
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,560
And the interesting thing is, from
that moment on, you start being

272
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,000
seen on the radar for promotions.

273
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,100
And it's not like you have to
knock on doors somewhere else.

274
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,520
It's like people come to you because
they see ah, there's potential.

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
And we want to put the trust
in that person and let that

276
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,540
person go on with that topic.

277
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,460
That was a good thing, actually.

278
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,760
But, the best thing of all,
to be honest with you is, I

279
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,950
didn't have to change anything.

280
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,720
I was scared before, as I told you, it's
do I have to be tired some all the time?

281
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Or do I have to, change
personality and become one of them?

282
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,030
It's no offense to nobody.

283
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,060
It's just, I'm not a native
speaker, so it might sound weird.

284
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,780
But the thing is, I was
always able to stay me.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,900
And I was able to, put some
more of my thoughts into the

286
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,260
company and into the process.

287
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,410
And that's a satisfying thing.

288
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,926
So in short, the learning from that
episode in my life was that ironically,

289
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:17,442
the key to producing great code at
work and truly enjoying tech wasn't in

290
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,594
the code itself, but it was beyond it.

291
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,294
And my story continued.

292
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:26,704
I got hooked to this topic somehow
because it worked and it felt better.

293
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,164
of course, I wanted to
improve my skills beyond code.

294
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,074
First of all, to have a
better work life experience.

295
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:34,254
And second of all, because
you're never alone.

296
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:37,124
And I saw potential in others in my team.

297
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:40,634
So I also thought about, hey,
I'd like to teach these methods.

298
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:41,394
So why not?

299
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:45,474
But the problem I hit is the
journey started faltering.

300
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,059
because you, actually, you do not find
many appropriate teachings out there.

301
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:56,529
So what I did is I started coaching
seminars, attending coaching seminars.

302
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,139
I went to leadership trainings,
I made these career seminars,

303
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,639
I went to soft skill courses.

304
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,169
And don't get me wrong,
these programs are all great.

305
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:07,649
But somehow, I think for the
target group of software engineers,

306
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,369
they are not so suitable.

307
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,289
You know what I mean?

308
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:13,954
You So the thing is, what I
got is, first of all, I thought

309
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,354
they were way too generic.

310
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:20,794
it's nice knowing about theory that in
groups, someone can become the alpha, one

311
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,284
is the beta, the other one is the gamma.

312
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:22,834
That's all nice.

313
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,004
But where's my practical advice?

314
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:25,854
what do I do with it?

315
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:28,004
I want it shorter, faster.

316
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:31,531
I want these hacks, I want
to use it immediately.

317
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,687
Then second of all those things
were not really tech related.

318
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,502
there were people related.

319
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,042
That's fine.

320
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,662
But I wanted, this special
factor with the tech sector.

321
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:43,152
And third of all, the, most
of the teaching styles were

322
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,822
not really, compatible.

323
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:46,662
Give you an example.

324
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,592
that depends on, on, on what
you like, but I'm not really the

325
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:54,612
type for, group therapy, chair,
circle, role play stuff, Depends.

326
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:55,442
Maybe you like it.

327
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:56,052
Good for you.

328
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:56,672
I don't.

329
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:58,112
So for me, it was a bit incompatible.

330
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:01,152
And the next thing I thought
was it felt, it really actually

331
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,262
felt a bit like therapy.

332
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:07,402
I thought that the approach most of the
time was that you go there and people show

333
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,622
you that there's something wrong with you.

334
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:14,612
And here's the solution that you should
adapt and change your personality.

335
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:19,422
So there's always a feeling I got
there, but I always thought, and I still

336
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,322
think there's nothing wrong with me.

337
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:23,072
Just there's nothing wrong with you.

338
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:25,062
We're just the way we
are, and that's good.

339
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:28,792
It's just about how we interact with each
other, and I don't want to change myself.

340
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:33,112
What I wanted is, I wanted
to be me, remain me, but I

341
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:37,102
wanted to have an efficient
compatibility layer with the world.

342
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,512
And that's fine to have.

343
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,912
This is why there are interfaces for.

344
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:40,972
Do you get what I mean?

345
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,532
I want, I wanted exactly these hacks.

346
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,117
That I've been telling you about.

347
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,807
Like this, okay, what can I do?

348
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,297
How can we make the
interaction more useful?

349
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:50,497
But I want to stay me.

350
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,907
And, it was pretty specific
what I was looking for.

351
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,617
But it was a bit of a disillusionment.

352
00:16:56,117 --> 00:17:00,397
Because unfortunately, there
was not enough suitable content.

353
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,987
And there were not enough
suitable learning methods as well.

354
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,777
So then one day, I was already
working, I was working in an e

355
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,717
commerce company and I was C level
there, which was actually pretty cool

356
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,887
and, stressy, but as a C level, you
have to know more about business.

357
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,947
And I wasn't really strong at that time.

358
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:19,117
So I was thinking about making an MBA.

359
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:22,587
The problem with an MBA is
that, it's really expensive.

360
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:23,647
It takes time.

361
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,647
It feels like going to university again.

362
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,777
So I wasn't too happy about that.

363
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:28,842
Yeah.

364
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,102
And then suddenly out of
nothing, I saw an offer from the

365
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:34,692
United States of an online MBA.

366
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,002
And it's called the Power MBA.

367
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:39,962
So I do not get money of them,
but if you hear me, send it

368
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:41,752
over 10 grands a day, please.

369
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:45,592
So no commercial here, but I got to name
it because it was really cool actually.

370
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:50,802
And it was an online school and
everything was online and everything

371
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,692
was based on videos on demand.

372
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:55,042
So it was pretty much my tempo.

373
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:58,722
I could do it whenever and wherever
I want, which I really like.

374
00:17:58,722 --> 00:17:59,762
And it was well structured.

375
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,972
then the format was like, micro learning.

376
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:03,812
I don't know if you know it.

377
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:07,462
It's like these, small
bite sized chunks to learn.

378
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:10,502
It's like you do 15
minutes a day and not more.

379
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,017
And statistically, the learning
results are 20 percent better

380
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,187
than on traditional training.

381
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,427
And I approved that.

382
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:18,887
That totally worked for me.

383
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:22,317
And the other thing I found really
cool was that statistically, you

384
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:26,597
have 50 percent more engagement
because it's way easier to commit to

385
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:30,937
15 minutes a day than to two hours
a day or to like, a long lesson.

386
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:37,057
And, third, it was completely based on
expert interviews in real life situations.

387
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:37,547
Yeah.

388
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:38,752
And I liked that.

389
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,492
And that sparked a fire.

390
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:45,432
I liked the format of this course so
much that this was the moment where I

391
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,772
thought, I want to create my own company.

392
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,392
And I said, if they can do it
like that, why don't we create

393
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:55,102
something like that for skills
beyond code for the tech industry.

394
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,242
And so what I did, what we did,
at outer skills, we went out

395
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,692
and we started interviewing as
many experts as we could find.

396
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:07,537
So experts that we considered as real
pros, successful people in the industry.

397
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,997
And those were technicians,
like all levels.

398
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:14,837
Um, technicians, software
engineers and architects as well.

399
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:18,107
We talked to the C levels
and to managers in between.

400
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:25,047
And what we did basically is we asked
them for their top five advice, tricks,

401
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:30,557
Hacks, self improvement things that
they would have given themselves

402
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:31,957
at the beginning of their career.

403
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,237
And most of the time, people will
start telling you these stories like

404
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:39,357
I just told you with Steven, like
these epiphanies they had, like this

405
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:42,777
one advice, or the person gave me that
advice and it changed everything forever.

406
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,207
And most of the time, those advice
are really practical and just clever.

407
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,987
And we started collecting all that
stuff and putting it together.

408
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:53,792
And what we saw is that
there is a pattern in there.

409
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:58,122
So what we did is we, let's
say decrypted that pattern.

410
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:02,002
And we found the seven rules
beyond code for it success.

411
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:07,487
And the seven categories that we found in
that advice are first of all, it's about

412
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:11,982
vision and purpose, which means, You got
to have a certain vision and idea what

413
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:15,272
you want to do in your job because most
of the time people don't really know what

414
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:19,562
they're really good at or what they desire
and what they actually do not really like.

415
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:24,862
But the sooner you start thinking
about that stuff, the pathway you're

416
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,132
going to do is going to get clearer.

417
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,822
Second of all, because everything starts
with yourself, is self management.

418
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:32,762
How do you organize yourself?

419
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:35,842
And how do you, for example, handle
criticism and all that stuff?

420
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:40,002
And there are really good tricks
how to also little algorithmic

421
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:43,362
hacks how to handle criticism.

422
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:47,342
I won't show them to you today,
but you can check it out later on.

423
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,402
I'll give you a link.

424
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:51,402
And then the third one is tech ownership.

425
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:53,632
I want to go into detail
with that one later on.

426
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:57,112
The fourth one is, of course,
communication, because we're humans,

427
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:58,652
we're communicating all the time.

428
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:03,312
See, this is sometimes we forget
that tech is a people business.

429
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:08,272
people create solutions for other
people in collaboration with

430
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:11,602
people, using technology as a tool.

431
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:15,202
But it's still around for and with people.

432
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:18,362
And why it is with people is
the fifth one is collaboration

433
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:22,732
because you're never alone and
five people are stronger than one.

434
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:24,622
Number six is the mindset.

435
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:29,632
It's, career also has to do with, like
what kind of mentality do you have?

436
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,652
And number seven, of
course, is business acumen.

437
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:34,242
Everything is about business.

438
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:38,482
Even if you're working for an open
source company, there has to be someone

439
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:40,062
who has to pay your bills, right?

440
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:44,707
and what we did is we put all that
together in our tech career playbook

441
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,307
that we call the seven rules beyond code.

442
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,577
So I'm happy that we're, I'm happy
to say that we've been putting skills

443
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,487
beyond code on the map since 2023.

444
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:57,107
We're having customers in three continents
already, and we're selling to individuals

445
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,107
and teams, but enough of a publicity.

446
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:05,497
that was, Yeah, you got to say
something about yourself as well.

447
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:08,197
I'm with Skills Beyond
Code already for a while.

448
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:12,517
And, I see a bunch of false beliefs that
people have in their mind all the time.

449
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:16,387
Probably the biggest one is that
soft skills cannot be learned.

450
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,067
Either you got it or you don't.

451
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,807
People often, have this image of the
nerds in their mind and that stuff.

452
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,817
And we even have TV series like Silicon
Valley or The IT Crowd or Big Bang Theory.

453
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,157
And they're nice to watch.

454
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:27,797
They're fun.

455
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:30,007
And you somehow can relate to that stuff.

456
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:30,737
That's nice.

457
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,427
But it's also crap when you
talk about real soft skills.

458
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:37,117
Because soft skills are
not about personality.

459
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:41,027
You cannot learn to change your
personality and you shouldn't.

460
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:41,697
That's you.

461
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,267
that's who you are.

462
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:46,867
But what you can do is you
can change some behaviors.

463
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,137
I just showed you how it works.

464
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:50,857
This is the stuff we did with Steven.

465
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:54,157
It's you can still be you, but
you can use some nice hacks and

466
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:57,367
some of your knowledge, your
cleverness to like, behave better.

467
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,417
differently.

468
00:22:58,427 --> 00:22:59,997
So that's a complete different approach.

469
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:01,577
Let me give you an example.

470
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:05,687
This here is a typical, photo
of me in a meeting situation.

471
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:10,797
I could sit, I could watch you do this
and this because I'm impatient and

472
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:14,747
I tend to be, let's say, impulsive
because I got Italian roots.

473
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:19,387
I got some fire in me and this
combined with German destruction could

474
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:22,077
become a hurricane from time to time.

475
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:27,187
The thing is, that Over the
years, I learned to see the

476
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:28,817
trigger and change that behavior.

477
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:30,897
And everything started with Steven again.

478
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,907
He watched me in meetings from time
to time and then he took me aside.

479
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:37,477
He recognized that and he gave me the
advice and he said, Listen, first of all,

480
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:39,147
you're not making nobody better with that.

481
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,517
Second of all, people will not like you.

482
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,157
And third, the results will
not get better that way.

483
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:45,807
this is a lose situation.

484
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:46,847
Change it.

485
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:51,907
And the thing he gave me was another small
algorithm, and it was the coin framework.

486
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:57,627
C for context, O observation,
I impact, N next steps.

487
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,727
I give you this example.

488
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:03,847
If there was a meeting where, let's
say, somebody used some wrong query

489
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:08,117
methods that slowed the application
down or whatsoever, I could sit there

490
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:12,987
in a normal mode and say, Oh, who the
hell did use these stupid methods?

491
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,237
You should know that better.

492
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,217
That fucks up our whole application.

493
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:17,207
I'm swearing.

494
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,797
Oh, but come on, this is the internet.

495
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:19,787
There are worse things there.

496
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:21,327
So you might be living with that.

497
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:24,377
And I would continue, Stupid
idiots, get that fixed, come on.

498
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:25,977
But that's crap.

499
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:26,917
That helps nobody.

500
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,507
That vented my steam off.

501
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:29,337
That's not okay.

502
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:32,327
I could say it with the coin framework.

503
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:33,547
Listen to that.

504
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:35,337
First of all, I could give context.

505
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:36,257
What am I talking about?

506
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:40,077
And I could say stuff like, during
my last code review, I checked the

507
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,967
solutions implemented in the new module.

508
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,157
Observation, what did I see?

509
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:47,467
I noticed that the current
implementation processes large

510
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:51,587
amounts of data at once, which might
not scale well as our system grows.

511
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,017
I for impact.

512
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,017
What do I see as a possible impact?

513
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,867
This could lead to slower response
times and increased resource

514
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:03,147
consumption, potentially affecting
user experience and system reliability.

515
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,237
And now give next steps.

516
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,647
This is the productive part.

517
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:12,187
Say stuff like, it might be helpful to
explore ways to process data in smaller

518
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:14,597
chunks or optimize resource usage.

519
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:17,837
Would you be open to discussing
potential approaches together?

520
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:23,137
I pretty much said the same thing, only
in a nice way, in a productive way, in

521
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:26,647
a positive way, that there might be a
positive outcome and nobody's offended.

522
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:29,707
Even if I wanted to, but I can
still offend them in my mind.

523
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:33,177
But it was totally easy, it's
just, it's another small algorithm

524
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:34,897
that changes the whole situation.

525
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:37,907
So this is about, you
cannot change who you are.

526
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:41,722
The Big Bang Theory is a nice
series, but Come on, it's a bit

527
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:42,852
different in the real world.

528
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:48,222
And the, the three most common
false beliefs we get besides, the

529
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:51,152
biggie I just talked to, told you
about is the first one is, my skills

530
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,572
are great, but my coworkers suck.

531
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:56,592
Like everybody, everybody
connects normally with my talks,

532
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:59,352
but the first thing they do is
they think about someone else.

533
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:03,052
It's yeah, he or she, they
don't have the skills.

534
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:05,982
Yeah, I can totally name a
situation with them, but they

535
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,222
do not think about themselves.

536
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:11,162
The second one is sounds pretty good,
but I don't want to go into management.

537
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:15,662
And the third one is the problem is
not my communication skills, but the

538
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:17,762
fact that management is not listening.

539
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:20,342
Okay, friends, let's
start with the first one.

540
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:25,442
whenever you think That you're
totally above the topic and the

541
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:27,722
others are not Think about it.

542
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:32,902
You might be running the risk to falling
into the Dunning Kruger effect Pattern

543
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:37,652
which means you think yeah, I'm really
expert here And I would not even challenge

544
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:41,942
that but the more you get into the
topic the sooner you start realizing

545
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:46,702
Hell, this is more complicated than I
thought and the real gurus are actually

546
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:51,972
real far away many studies have shown
that 80 percent of people believe that

547
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:56,852
they have above average soft skills,
but only about 20 percent actually do.

548
00:26:57,402 --> 00:26:58,072
let me ask you.

549
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,222
If most people think, They
are above average, but

550
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:04,362
logically, that can't be true.

551
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,482
Where do you think they really stand?

552
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:08,442
Or where do you think you really stand?

553
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:10,032
Let's make an experiment.

554
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,562
Let me ask you, how do you
recognize a great communicator?

555
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:14,582
Think about it.

556
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:20,962
Most of the time, people will list
traits like listening, emotional

557
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,682
intelligence, and clarity.

558
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:27,432
And now I ask yourself, do you
consistently do all these things yourself?

559
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:31,282
there's a difference between knowing
about it, and yeah, that's obvious, that's

560
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,442
so clear, and actually implementing it.

561
00:27:34,832 --> 00:27:36,222
There's a giant difference.

562
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:40,272
And let me give you another
huge statistic about that.

563
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,522
Have you ever heard
about the chaos report?

564
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:45,322
The chaos report is a large
study that gets conducted

565
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:46,242
like pretty much every year.

566
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:53,062
what they do is they screen about 5, 000
projects worldwide and the IT projects and

567
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:55,222
they categorize them in three categories.

568
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:59,542
The first one is successful, which
means it was done in time and in budget.

569
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:04,382
The second one is called challenged, which
means It's either in time or on budget.

570
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:07,802
And the third one is failed,
which means not in time, not in

571
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,682
budget or completely canceled.

572
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:11,352
Have an intelligent guess.

573
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:13,052
How many are successful?

574
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:16,832
For all of you who now think
five or 10, shame on you because

575
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,102
it's your industry as well.

576
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:22,722
For all of you who think 80 or up
against, no one thinks that reality

577
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:27,722
is it's 30 percent 30 percent of all
projects can be classified as successful.

578
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:32,552
Which honestly, friends from
engineer to engineer, that's a shame.

579
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:33,532
That's our industry.

580
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:36,832
Can you name another
industry with such bad quota?

581
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:42,342
Can you imagine plastical surgery going
in there and saying, 30 percent of

582
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,772
the cases is going to be successful.

583
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:44,762
it really sucks.

584
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:51,272
And on the other hand, it also means
that 70 percent of all projects are not

585
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:54,572
satisfying for the customer because they
did not get what they originally wanted.

586
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:56,942
but here's the crazy
thing about the statistic.

587
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:59,582
This statistic has been
going on since the mid 90s.

588
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:02,132
So the reliable numbers
are, I would say from 2000.

589
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:07,102
So for the past 25 years, the
numbers have hardly changed.

590
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:11,912
It's always around 30 percent successful
and always about the same amount of

591
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:19,162
what is not successful for 20 years or
now, almost 25 years, the same numbers.

592
00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:20,582
Although.

593
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,332
Especially those, these conferences
tell you technology is getting

594
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,972
better and better every day.

595
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:27,902
Everything is disruptive.

596
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:29,742
Things are getting cooler and whatsoever.

597
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,322
But is there a change?

598
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:32,362
No, there is not.

599
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,352
And they also, look for
the reasons in this study.

600
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,482
And the reasons is people.

601
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:38,732
It's communication.

602
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:39,912
It's people business.

603
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,412
Like I told you, it's process now.

604
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:43,472
It's like people work with each other.

605
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:44,992
It's crazy thing, huh?

606
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:46,442
think about it.

607
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,632
Just let that settle.

608
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:49,452
Second false belief.

609
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:53,692
Sounds good, but I don't want to go
into management, so I might not need it.

610
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:54,632
friends.

611
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:57,932
That's pretty much a really false belief.

612
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:02,332
Because, It's not only in management
where you need skills beyond code.

613
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:03,562
I'll give you an example.

614
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:06,912
There's a statistic from the ICIMS
Hiring Institute, by the way.

615
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,052
It's like a huge institute that
puts people into labor that says

616
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:16,472
94 percent of all IT recruiters or
tech recruiters believe that people

617
00:30:16,472 --> 00:30:21,352
with greater soft skills and skills
beyond code are way more likely to be

618
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:26,892
promoted than people with more years
of experience but weaker soft skills.

619
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,232
And a promotion is not only into
management, it's becoming a senior,

620
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:34,552
it's becoming an individual contributor,
it's becoming an architect, it's

621
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:37,622
becoming a tech lead and whatsoever,
it doesn't have to be with people.

622
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:42,452
So promotions are directly
coupled with skills beyond code.

623
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:46,842
Actually another statistic says that 75
percent of promoters would even cut an

624
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:51,572
interview short even if the tech skills
are supreme, but if the rest is not good.

625
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:52,922
And here's another one.

626
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:55,472
Even as a software
engineer, what do you think?

627
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:57,292
How much time do you spend in meetings?

628
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,332
What do you guess?

629
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:00,992
On average, that's an American statistic.

630
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:02,292
It's 53%.

631
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:07,382
I've seen that the German statistics are
between 40 and 50%, something like that.

632
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:08,022
Still.

633
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,682
let it be 35 in a good case.

634
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:13,752
It's still a hell of time that
you have to spend in meetings.

635
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:14,292
And think about it.

636
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:19,182
It's daily plannings, reviews, retros,
refinements, team meetings, emergency

637
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,322
meetings, blah, blah, blah, blah.

638
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:21,292
You can read it yourself.

639
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:24,052
That's a whole lot of time that
you have to spend in meetings.

640
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,302
And that's a whole lot of
time that can be frustrating.

641
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:31,492
And it could be so much better if
you had like nicer, nicer hacks

642
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,902
to deal with, with those moments.

643
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:36,352
And, the third false belief
is that, the problem is not my

644
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:40,502
communication skills, but the fact
that management is not listening.

645
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:43,992
first of all, if the fact is that
management is not understanding,

646
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:46,762
then it is your problem because
then you're not explaining well.

647
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:51,272
It's always easy to point it at
them, but that won't fix nothing.

648
00:31:51,502 --> 00:31:52,662
You got to try harder there.

649
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:55,922
So then this is about, having a
different communication approach.

650
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:58,672
But I tell you what the, what's
the real thing behind that.

651
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,452
This thing has to do with
your expertise status.

652
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:03,232
Let's play a game.

653
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:09,882
Think about in your mind, think about
a doctor, a medic, medical doctor.

654
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,092
How does he or she look like?

655
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:14,662
Pretty much it's going
to look like that, right?

656
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:18,696
Person in white suit, like everybody
has the same image in their head.

657
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:20,736
I think it wouldn't go
too far away from that.

658
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:22,976
Now think about a car mechanic.

659
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:24,636
How does that look like?

660
00:32:25,136 --> 00:32:26,026
Pretty much like this?

661
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:28,396
Like someone working under a car?

662
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:32,776
Like some oil over with tools
and gloves and stuff like that?

663
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,126
I guess so.

664
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:36,796
And now, think about a software engineer.

665
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:37,936
What do you see?

666
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:41,926
I googled the pictures, because
whenever you want to have the public

667
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:45,576
opinion about something, you can just
google the pictures and then you see

668
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:48,146
honestly, the picture that people
have in their mind about something.

669
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:49,156
And it looks like that.

670
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:51,136
It's like a creepy guy in the basement.

671
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,196
And what's the problem
with that situation?

672
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:54,196
think about it.

673
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:57,726
If you go to a doctor, And the
doctor tells you, listen, we're

674
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,126
going to make that kind of therapy.

675
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,726
You're going to take these pills.

676
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:04,716
We're going to do, we're going to make it
three weeks like that, then an operation.

677
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:06,026
You won't say, nah.

678
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,796
We skip two thirds of the
pills because of costs.

679
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,316
we don't do that.

680
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,226
We do it this way.

681
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:14,836
And if you do an operation, take a
bone here and save it over there.

682
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,026
You would never do that.

683
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,451
You would not even go to your car mechanic
and say, Hey, listen, why don't you

684
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:24,881
do it with duct tape and use some oil
from the kitchen that I have left over.

685
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:27,291
He would look at you and said,
get the hell out of here.

686
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,231
First of all, you wouldn't do it.

687
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,431
Second of all, they wouldn't do it.

688
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:34,701
But in our line of work,
My customer's king.

689
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:39,391
And, it's so easy to
make an, Um, to, English.

690
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:40,011
What are the words?

691
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:41,601
To make an exception.

692
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,021
Like, why don't you put in an if?

693
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,361
Why don't you skip the tests?

694
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,251
Why don't you do that?

695
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:48,711
it's just for the MVP.

696
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,661
We're going to fix it later
on and stuff like that.

697
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:51,991
We do that all the time.

698
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:53,651
And here's the problem.

699
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:59,001
If someone tells you how to do your
job, you are no longer an expert.

700
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:00,501
Listen carefully.

701
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,311
If someone tells you how to do your job.

702
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,571
You are no longer an expert.

703
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:07,141
And that's the problem with that.

704
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,041
Why are they not listening?

705
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:11,741
Because you are not
being seen as an expert.

706
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,331
And the way to shift
that is the following.

707
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:19,921
First of all, you as an
engineer, you own the how part.

708
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:23,941
Whatever idea, somebody comes up with an
idea, that's the why we have to do it.

709
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:25,221
Then some smart people think about it.

710
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,661
What exactly do we have to do?

711
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,031
And then there's the how part.

712
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,211
How does it get implemented
in a tech world?

713
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,361
First of all, nobody tells
you how to do your job.

714
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:34,391
You're the expert.

715
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,681
Shield that area.

716
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:39,301
The how is closed from now on.

717
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:43,371
Second of all, start influencing
the what and why part.

718
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:48,031
The sooner and earlier you get in,
the more benefit you will have.

719
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:49,401
Let me show you this way.

720
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:55,591
When you start a project, the earlier
you are in your project, the more impact

721
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,201
and influence you have on the project.

722
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:57,946
Okay.

723
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:02,006
But at a certain point in time,
you reach a point that I call

724
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,186
the point of no return, where you
cannot change, requirements anymore.

725
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:08,506
They're just, they're sealed.

726
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,681
And you missed your time to go
in there and change something.

727
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,871
Because you as the expert
might even change the world.

728
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:16,511
Because I know what you want to do.

729
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:19,271
But in the tech world, you
solve things differently.

730
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:20,651
You might even have a benefit from it.

731
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,621
If you don't, requirements are sealed.

732
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:28,191
No matter how stupid they are,
they'll just get approved.

733
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,521
And then you have to live
with something like that.

734
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:36,081
And at a certain point after that, nobody
will remember the planners anymore.

735
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:39,271
Because the planning part is
over, then the implementation and

736
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,881
the maintenance part continues.

737
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:44,731
So for most of the time of the
project, everything that people will

738
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:47,801
remember is, who built that crap?

739
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:48,911
You did.

740
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,261
So that means stupid decision,
you have to live with it, and

741
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:54,401
you will be blamed for it.

742
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:58,161
Even if you think it was never my idea,
I knew it better from the beginning.

743
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:59,551
Nobody listened to me.

744
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,131
Doesn't matter.

745
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:03,431
People will think you are the guy.

746
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:06,426
So get in early.

747
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:07,446
This is the motivation.

748
00:36:07,726 --> 00:36:11,886
The sooner you get in, the better the
solution will be, the less technical

749
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:15,406
debt you might produce because you
as an expert have the hindsight to

750
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:20,306
think about it and the less pain
in the ass for your daily work.

751
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:24,056
And most important of
all, you remain credible.

752
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:27,946
So I see I'm running out of time,
which is why I got to come to an

753
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:29,486
end of this presentation slowly.

754
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:30,856
Nope.

755
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,196
Let me ask you a simple question.

756
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:39,216
If you reflect on everything you saw
today, if you did it how I did, how

757
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:42,926
we saw it today, do you think you
could be more successful with that?

758
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:44,636
Could that work for you?

759
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:49,826
if you used expert hacks, just like
the way I presented them today to tweak

760
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:54,891
your communication, to bridge the gap
between tech and business, i. e. make

761
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:57,801
them understand even non technical
people, bring them on the level,

762
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:02,361
make them understand, get them in the
game and improve your team play and

763
00:37:02,361 --> 00:37:04,981
start changing and improving things.

764
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:06,441
Could that work for you?

765
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:10,681
the thing is, over the years, what
we saw that, people who skill up

766
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:15,536
beyond code First of all, for them,
it's the benefit you get from it.

767
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:19,716
For sure, it's a door opener for
better jobs and higher salaries.

768
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,466
We don't only know that statistically.

769
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:22,656
That's what people say.

770
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:25,186
And that's let's say, a
logical conclusion of that.

771
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:29,186
Second of all, you get a
competitive edge in the job market.

772
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:33,226
According to the springboard report,
last year's springboard report,

773
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:36,326
it was and they said that about
70 percent of people working in

774
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:39,666
the STEM field, technicians, lack.

775
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:43,371
important business skills,
business soft skills and skills

776
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:45,401
beyond their expertise area.

777
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,336
75 percent is a lot.

778
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,856
So if you skill up in
that area, that's a cheat.

779
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:52,586
You can cut the line for job applications.

780
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:55,336
you, can stand out in job
interviews and stuff like that.

781
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:59,566
You're a special one compared
to the three others next to you.

782
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:03,166
So one in four, that's actually
a nice thing for yourself.

783
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,236
It's an efficiency boost.

784
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:07,966
I, for myself can say I had a
way better work life experience.

785
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:13,446
And, a very interesting one, the world
economic forum said that by 2027.

786
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:17,711
Jobs will have changed so much
that in pretty much every job

787
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:21,491
you have to focus more on human
skills because that's actually what

788
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:23,421
really differentiates us from AI.

789
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:28,131
AI is pretty strong in pretty much every
task but on a human interacting level

790
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:32,181
even if it sounds good for first it's
still a machine so there will still be

791
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:36,581
humans working together and this is a
thing where you really could stand out.

792
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,231
What you could definitely get rid
of and that I can prove is you.

793
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,906
Being overlooked and ignored,
if that is important for you.

794
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:47,516
Not being understood and, trust
me, lots of meeting drama.

795
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:52,206
For me, the most important thing would
have been, it's most easy to say it

796
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:56,426
with a quote of Benjamin Franklin, which
says, Lost time is never found again.

797
00:38:57,026 --> 00:39:02,121
So if I had a DeLorean time machine where
I could travel back in time, And teach

798
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:05,611
myself all that stuff, all the hacks
that Stephen had and all the stuff that

799
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,471
we found out later for the beginning.

800
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,561
Boy, that would have saved
me lots of gray hair.

801
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,111
Right now, in that light, I think,
and with my shorter hair, you don't

802
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,311
see it so much, and that is good.

803
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:19,801
But this is when my hair are longer, how
it looks like, and this is thanks to many

804
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,521
meeting situations, this I can tell you.

805
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:25,061
And so I ask you, like in every
presentation you will attend throughout

806
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:29,511
this conference and throughout many other
conferences, you always have two choices.

807
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:31,061
Blue pill and red pill.

808
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:32,721
First of all, do nothing.

809
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:33,751
And that's totally fine.

810
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:34,681
Without judgment.

811
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:35,841
You don't have to do anything.

812
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,541
You can just let it soak in.

813
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,121
Like more knowledge, okay?

814
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:41,321
And then continue with whatever you do.

815
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:42,431
And that's fine.

816
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,731
If you like to stay
invisible, again, no judgment.

817
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:45,741
Many people like that.

818
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,476
If you're more like an order taker,
If you, if you just basically want

819
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:54,736
to survive and have an okay time, and
if you like, if you prefer to keep

820
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,606
complaining, I'm allowed to say that.

821
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:59,856
I got Italian relatives and complaining
is a sport there that I can tell you.

822
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:02,266
So if that is the thing
for you, that's fine.

823
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:03,166
Take the blue pill.

824
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:08,266
But if you're more like somebody who says,
No, actually, I want to make a change.

825
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:09,156
I want to get active.

826
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,496
I want my career to grow.

827
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,216
I want my personality to grow.

828
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:15,746
And I want to start winning
things, especially at work.

829
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:20,401
Then take a leap of faith, get
active, do something about it.

830
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:21,851
This is really an advice
that I could give you.

831
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:25,231
There are many possibilities out
there to improve that skill set.

832
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:29,171
There's one that I can offer you and
I'd like to do that on my final, with

833
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:31,051
my final words here in that, conference.

834
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:37,381
So if I offered to take your skills
beyond code to an expert level to help

835
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:42,176
you boost your career in the next 30 days,
without you having to leave your home or

836
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:46,956
office and you can take the video course
whenever, wherever you want, on demand.

837
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:50,146
You don't have to sit through
long, boring lectures.

838
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:54,156
You only get concise and straight
to the point microlearning videos

839
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,576
and you probably don't even have to
pay for it because your boss has a

840
00:40:57,576 --> 00:41:01,756
training budget for you anyway that you
shouldn't let go to waste, my friends.

841
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:02,846
Here's my question.

842
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:04,056
Would you take me up on that offer?

843
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:05,666

844
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,406

845
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:10,596
