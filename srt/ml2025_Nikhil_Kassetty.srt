00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,630
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,979
I'm Hil Kati, a software engineer
focused on AI cloud and FinTech.

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,719
Today I'll be walking you through how
AI powered digital twin technology can

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,649
transform the way we manage financial
risk and optimize assets across

5
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:19,090
industries, especially in high stake
environments like finance and operations.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,940
Let's begin by understanding
the context behind the stock.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,540
In today's fast evolving financial
landscape, organizations are

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,750
under constant pressure to
manage risk, performance, and

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,000
efficiency all in real time.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,380
So traditional approaches that
rely on static models, periodic

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,370
reports, or siloed data are
increasingly insufficient day by day.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,180
So this is where our digital twin
technology becomes a game changer

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,190
for us in the financial world.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,960
A digital twin is a real.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,620
Time.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,349
Digital replica of financial
entity or a system.

17
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:55,980
It could represent a portfolio,
a payment network, risk model, or

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,900
even an end-to-end business process.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,330
Unlike static dashboards, these twins are.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,100
Dynamic con, continuously
updated and also simulate both

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,410
current and potential feature.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,270
Also like the states using live I
would say like live data streams here.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,200
So now when we integrate this
with artificial intelligence

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,280
and machine learning, we
unlock the ability to predict.

25
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:25,225
Financial anomalies and also risks
before they materialize and also simulate

26
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:28,164
complex market and also credit scenarios.

27
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:32,094
And another thing is to continuously
optimize asset management

28
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,774
and decision making at scale.

29
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,824
And now I would like to walk you through
a framework that combines digital twins,

30
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:46,884
real time financial data, and also a IP
work pre predictive models, including.

31
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:49,019
Random Forest classifier.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,800
A powerful I would say like it's more I
was saying like powerful because it's more

33
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,720
based on a learning method for classifying
risk patterns and financial events.

34
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,620
And another one is L Esteem,
which stands for long short-term

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,460
memory networks, which is like a
type of recurrent neural network.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,920
Particularly effective for
detecting patterns over time in

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,110
financial time series kind of data.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,550
So this fusion of technologies
empowers financial institutions to

39
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,340
detect irregularities early and also
allocate resources more efficiently

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,040
and also move faster and make more
informed decisions on a timely basis.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,220
So in essence, this is how we move from.

42
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,010
Data to decisions using AI and
digital twins to minimize risk

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,900
and also maximize the value.

44
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:45,635
And coming to the background, what we are
trying to do here is it's like a more of

45
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:51,575
a concept evolved and why it matters today
in regular finance is the most important.

46
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:57,065
So now getting there, digital twins
began in aerospace and manufacturing,

47
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:01,385
I would say as digital replicas of
physical assets that initially helped.

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,740
Simulate and monitor,
improve their behavior.

49
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,370
But over time, the concept has
evolved beyond the physical world.

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,950
Today we apply digital twin technology
to finance to create virtual real time

51
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,380
models of portfolios, customer segments,
credit flows, and operation pipelines.

52
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,820
These twins.

53
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,410
As living financial models
continuously update using transactional

54
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,360
behavior and also the market data.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,710
So now when we pair this artificial
intelligence and machine learning model,

56
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,410
we unlock next level capabilities.

57
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,180
That is more of like forecasting or risk
exposure before even they cause harm.

58
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,950
And another thing is to detecting
deviations in real time.

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,730
Like it can be like fraud or
even the default risk even that

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,230
can happen within a twin of.

61
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,805
Your actual financial system
that you have created.

62
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:59,345
So this shift reflects a broader
trend, part of Industry 4.0 and FinTech

63
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:03,605
2.0, where traditional systems are
giving away to automated, adaptive

64
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,060
and intelligent infrastructures here.

65
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:11,495
So I'd say instead of reacting
after risks or inefficient appear,

66
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:17,645
organizations can use digital twins to
anticipate and also act ahead of time.

67
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:22,025
So now there, obviously for every
thing that we work on, there's always

68
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,885
like problems that we come across.

69
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:27,775
So looking at the problem statement
and objectives that we would like

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,065
to identify as part of this talk
are presented in the next slide.

71
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:39,495
So before we explore the full architecture
and the process that's being done

72
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:44,085
as part of this overall digital twin
technology, let's define the core

73
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,215
problem that we are trying to solve here.

74
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:51,315
So most financial systems today
still rely on after the fact

75
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:55,245
analysis, whether it's like risk
scoring, asset performance tracking,

76
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,075
or operational reporting as well.

77
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,085
So these systems often.

78
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,745
Operate in silos like there's always
like a blind spot and also delayed

79
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,515
reactions in critical moments.

80
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:10,105
So even where digital twin models
exist, they're usually static

81
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:14,275
fragmented, and also like it can be
domain specific most of the time.

82
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:19,035
The most often things that they lack
here are like real time adaptability

83
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:22,995
and also like seamless integration
with live financial data streams, and

84
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:27,525
also the intelligence to learn, evolve,
and optimize themselves over time.

85
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:32,355
And also when these financial
activities are interconnected.

86
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,010
So they form credit risk to
liquidity management and also asset

87
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,050
performance of regulatory complaints.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,700
So to address this, our objective is to
build an AI power digital twin framework

89
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,310
that brings real time awareness across
financial systems and also a driven

90
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,200
insights through models like RFC and
LSTM that I have discussed earlier.

91
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:02,645
And the ability to simulate and respond to
scenarios proactively, whether it's fraud

92
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:08,375
detection, market shifts, or like asset
financing, everything can be more likely

93
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,665
processed with some good data collection
and how we pre-process the data.

94
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,275
So that is something we can
look into the next slide.

95
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,055
So coming to the data collection
and pre-processing, let me walk

96
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:25,015
you through how the data processing
or overall collection can help

97
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,055
data with our digital twin models.

98
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:32,465
I would say more of helping a
real time financial data streams.

99
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:36,335
So we begin by tapping into real
time financial data streams,

100
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:41,160
which include transactional data
from payments, loans, and trades.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,560
Portfolio level metrics, like if
you say the portfolio level metrics,

102
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,120
there are a lot more risk involved
in that, like exposure risk scores

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,710
and also a lot of fluctuations.

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,480
So coming to the indicators where we
can identify this, like there are always

105
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,840
like liquidity indicators, both internal
which I can say like reserve ratios

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,910
and external like funding availability.

107
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,380
These are like some of the.

108
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,085
Financial data that we
need to collect as well.

109
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:12,155
And coming to the market data such as
volatility, interest rates, or economic

110
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,905
sentiment indexes pulled from a lot
of different APIs are also collected

111
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,035
and which is very critical for us.

112
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:23,585
So as part of the data cleaning process
or like pre-processing, the first

113
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:25,175
step is to conduct data cleaning.

114
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:28,865
Handle missing records and
also detect anomalies like

115
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,575
spike in transaction volume.

116
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,615
That may be a system error or like it
can be also resolving or formatting

117
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:39,665
mismatches in general, like it can
be like a lot more anomalies too.

118
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:45,245
So then we perform normalization and
feature scaling so that all inputs

119
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,465
are aligned in a compatible range.

120
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:53,675
Which is crucial for most machine learning
models like random forests or L SDMs

121
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,985
to learn accurately and efficiently.

122
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,775
So coming to the proposed framework.

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,690
This is like a proposed framework,
which are like step by step done in a

124
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,190
defined way to, to get the overall data
cleaning and also the pre-processing.

125
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,200
As we see, this slide shows that
end-to-end architecture of the AI power

126
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
digital twin framework tailored for.

127
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,490
Financial risk management
and a sub optimization.

128
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,790
Here we see how the
data collection happens.

129
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,530
So the data collection begins by
collecting real-time financial data.

130
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,740
So we, that happened from core
systems, like as mentioned, like

131
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,790
payments, loans, credit platforms,
and also the market feeds, interest

132
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,055
rates, volatility indexes, and also.

133
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:42,065
APIs and third party providers, which
can provide complaints, updates,

134
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,535
and also the sentiment signals.

135
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:48,245
So this serve as the foundation
for understanding life, financial

136
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:52,865
behavior, and risk exposures or
outliers that we can always look for.

137
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:59,855
After this, we do the data cleaning to
correct or exclude all the flawed records.

138
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,105
So this is where the cleanup happens.

139
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:07,595
And now, and the next step is to normalize
to this like align different scales,

140
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:12,515
crucial for training relatable models that
we were discussing in the previous slides.

141
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:15,155
So the next step is the
feature engineering.

142
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,925
This is where the extract of
predictive indicators happen.

143
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:22,375
So rolling averages or
transactional patterns or like

144
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,995
liquidity shifts over time.

145
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:28,915
Anomalies in portfolio drift or credit
realization and also like synthetic

146
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:33,145
risk flags based on loan three sh also
happen in the future engineering step.

147
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:39,205
And then we do the digital twin
model development here, a real

148
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:44,245
time enhanced digital replica of
a financial system that has like.

149
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:49,135
Portfolio manager, credit underwriting
flow or fraud detection pipeline.

150
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,565
These kind of pipelines are built here.

151
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:57,265
So this twin evolves continuously as new
data arrives and it gets integrated with

152
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:02,065
the financial telemetry instead of the
physical systems and also simulations

153
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:06,745
of cash flow and also like market
turbulence can also be monitored and.

154
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:12,535
As said, these ML models are trained
on historical plus streaming data.

155
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:17,575
So now when we see this random forest are
used for rule-based risk classification

156
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:21,295
and like LS, TM is used for time
series predictions, example market

157
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:23,885
response which happens over the time.

158
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:28,055
And also like we use SVM model for
separating risk tires at different

159
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:32,825
levels, and we use auto encoders for
anomaly detection without label data.

160
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:35,945
So as we see the asset management happens.

161
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:41,215
More like into this insights feed
directly into capital allocation,

162
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:45,955
liquidity balancing, or fraud handling
strategies in a more dynamic manner.

163
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:50,920
So when we come to the reinforcement
learning here, so finally, I. When

164
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,370
we are applying the reinforcement
learning to continually improve the

165
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,510
system, it learns from our outcomes to
adjust thresholds, reallocate capital,

166
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,400
or also optimize strategies based on
the rewards feedback that like cost

167
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,900
savings or risk mitigation success,
anything that gets back to the system.

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,440
So in short.

169
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:15,885
I would say like this framework
connects data to models and models, get

170
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,535
connected to the financial intelligence,
and which in turn measures a lot of

171
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:26,975
business value in terms of different
aspects as part of overall process.

172
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:30,455
How does methodology and
overall this framework worked?

173
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,815
So there, there are like some
results that we got popped up once.

174
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:38,485
We are, once we are processed through
that system, so now when we look at the

175
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:43,165
results, how it performs, like looking
at the bar chart, we are comparing

176
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:44,515
four machine learning models here.

177
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:49,615
The random forest classifier, long short
term memory and support vector machine.

178
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,235
And also like the auto encoder.

179
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:56,825
So each was tested on a financial
data set to predict risk signals such

180
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:00,905
as anomalies in transaction flow,
portfolio stress, and also credit

181
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:03,395
utilization drifts that keeps happening.

182
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:07,775
So coming to the accuracy here,
so RFC is leading with 95.

183
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:13,075
0.5% followed close by lstm, which
is a bit shorter than that, which is

184
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:15,235
vital for realtime decisioning here.

185
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,375
And coming to the precision RFC
and LSTM models, again take the

186
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,515
lead indicating their ability
to reduce the false positives.

187
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,685
So this is very critical in finance
systems to reduce the false positives,

188
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:31,345
like I would say, like for example,
flagging fraud or credit risk only when

189
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,535
it truly matters is really important.

190
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,180
So coming to the recall part of it,
so again here, RFC and LSTM also excel

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,030
with a lot more higher percentage
compared to the respective other models.

192
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,040
So here, high recall means fewer false
negatives even, which is that which

193
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,730
is also more important in financial
risk analysis, which is important

194
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,440
also for catching all genuine risk
signals to understand if it is

195
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
really a false positive or a false
negative in coming to the F1 score.

196
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,450
Fund score is also indication for a solid
balance between precision and recall.

197
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,430
So if you see this even here, RFC in
L-S-D-M-R at a higher level indicating

198
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,260
a really good balance, as I was saying.

199
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,050
So auto and coder and SVM performed
reasonably well, but are a be ru

200
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,310
variable in balanced trade offs
when we are trying to make some

201
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,870
trade offs between different models.

202
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,130
So coming to the.

203
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:33,315
Overall results, the precision recall
and accuracy that is all important,

204
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:38,315
that when we are looking at the pre-call
recall precision recall and accuracy,

205
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:43,485
let's now break down like how the
performance of each model across four

206
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:48,165
evaluation metrics, precision recall,
fund score, and accuracy are monitored.

207
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:49,840
So these metrics.

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,170
We're calculated based on each model's
ability to predict financial anomalies,

209
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,790
like unusual transaction patterns,
risk threshold breaches, or also early

210
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,440
signs of asset under performance.

211
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,770
So when I say like random
forest classifier, so this was

212
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,570
achieved by highest across.

213
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:11,595
All categories, accuracy, precision,
recall, and also F1 score.

214
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:15,015
When we are looking at the balance
between these two, it helps

215
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:18,855
detecting true risk events and
minimizing the false positives here.

216
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:25,695
So long short term memory, LSTM model,
like each performs very close to RFC and

217
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:30,735
also like especially strong in recall
making it effective for capturing.

218
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,530
Time-based financial patterns such as
liquidity depths, and also like credit

219
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,300
defaults over time when we are coming to
the next model support vector machine.

220
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:48,280
So slow, moderate performance accuracy
is like 90% lower recall, such as it's

221
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,590
likely to mess risk signals over time.

222
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,820
So still valuable.

223
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:57,795
For binary classifications like fraud
detection and also with clear patterns.

224
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,905
So when it comes to the auto
encoder, we, it also performs well

225
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:06,675
considering it's unsupervised with
the more precision value, but also

226
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:08,685
compared to the anomal as it detects.

227
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:12,225
So when we are coming to the
final decision that we want

228
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:15,645
to make both RFC and LSTM.

229
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,460
Stand out best performing models for
real time financial monitoring and

230
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,310
also like risk prediction offering the
accuracy and balance required for high

231
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,470
stakes decision making in finance.

232
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,440
So looking at these models, there are lot.

233
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,850
There's another thing that we
need to focus on discussing like

234
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,630
overall like cost benefit coming
to how these models performed.

235
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,685
So when we're trying to
discuss the cost benefit.

236
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:48,095
So I'd say like the initial cost
would be like a little initial cost.

237
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:53,375
To make this overall digital twin perform
better would be like little lesser.

238
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,335
So ideally, like it would help, like
overall downtime reduction, like

239
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:02,495
traditional setups can't adopt in real
time, so they offer 0% downtime reduction.

240
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,015
But in DT enabled models.

241
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,470
We improve system resilience and
prediction accuracy leading to a 25%

242
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,920
reduction in downtime, like I would say,
especially during high risk events like

243
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,480
liquidate shortages or fraud spikes,
and however, the return on investment.

244
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
So traditional systems
ideally don't yield.

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
I. A meaningful return on investment
in dynamic financial environment.

246
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:31,800
But the DT Powered Systems by Contracts
show a one 45% return on investment,

247
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,750
validating not only their operational
value, but also their financial

248
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,405
justification for their I would say like
more of a decision making situation.

249
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:45,545
Coming to the final touch point,
what I wanted to say is digital twins

250
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:50,375
require great investment upfront, but
they generate substantial recurring

251
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:55,295
value over time, both in financial
returns and also operational silence.

252
00:16:56,295 --> 00:17:02,445
So to wrap up, the digital twin framework
clearly demonstrates how AI integrated

253
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,935
system with digital twins can elevate
financial systems by making them more

254
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:11,885
predictive response and also silent by
analyzing the approach we have achieved.

255
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,865
I would say like very much measurable
benefits, a 25% reduction in

256
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:20,155
unplanned operational downtime, an
18% decrease in overall maintenance

257
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:25,525
or overhead costs, and also like a 20%
improvement in asset utilization where.

258
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:30,015
That helps with the capital
efficiency, liquidity deployment, or

259
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,815
also risk-based resource allocation.

260
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:37,835
This is possible just that we are
not just monitoring system anymore.

261
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:40,295
We are modeling them
intelligently in real time.

262
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:45,725
So when I say the random forest and
long short term memory models, we

263
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:48,965
are able to generate high confidence
predictions and simulations.

264
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:53,765
These predictions directly support
strategic decisions from mitigation.

265
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,920
Also to portfolio rebalancing
or also liquidity allocation.

266
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,360
So as a result, I, we have seen like
one 45% return on investments, which

267
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,980
proves that it isn't just a technical
win, but also it's a financial one.

268
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,990
And also these intelligent systems
also enable real time visibility and

269
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,580
automated scenario planning, which helps
financial institutions take action a

270
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,980
bit early, avoiding crisis, and also
can definitely improve the performance.

271
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:28,205
However, as the challenges remain,
the scalability is still across large,

272
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,395
multi-layered financial systems, right?

273
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,740
And the real time synchronization,
especially when integrating diverse.

274
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,270
Data sources.

275
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,700
It gets a little difficult,
but it's still manageable.

276
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,200
System compatibility is also how
well the system is compatible

277
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
with the legacy infrastructure.

278
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,450
That is one thing to really consider
here as these are more of like a solvable

279
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,860
problems and they don't really point
to the need for continued innovation

280
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,030
in cross-functional collaboration
to unlock the full potential of AI

281
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,770
powered digital twins in finance.

282
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,510
The future of financial
Resa lies in more of moving.

283
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:08,415
From static reporting to living
learning systems and here the digital

284
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,185
twins powered by AI are really
the bridge that can get us there.

285
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,245
Thank you so much for the attention.

286
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:21,835
I'm all good and open to answer any
questions that you have here today.
