00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,400
Hello, my name is Abhinav Chuncho.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm a senior software engineer in Lowe's.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,910
Today I'll be presenting about the
adaptive interfaces, enhancing the user

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,259
experience through dynamic interactions.

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,929
In this presentation, we'll
be going through introduction

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,829
to adaptive interfaces.

7
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:21,939
It's also called AUIs and why AUIs
matter in today's digital landscape,

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,329
key techniques in AUI development,
impact of key techniques of user

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,159
engagement and efficiency and
adaptive interfaces in action.

10
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:37,284
benefits of implementing AUIs, challenges
in implementing AUIs, and the future of

11
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:39,704
adaptive user interfaces and conclusion.

12
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,664
So introduction to
adaptive user interfaces.

13
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:46,924
Adaptive interfaces, adaptive user
interfaces are the systems that

14
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:51,084
modify their behavior and appearance
in real time to accommodate the

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,594
individual user preferences.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:58,144
Unlike the traditional static user
interfaces, AUIs dynamically adjust

17
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:02,724
based on the user interactions, learned
patterns, and environmental factors.

18
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:09,084
And the key goals for these AUIs
are providing the personalized

19
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:14,054
experiences, reducing cognitive
load to enhance user efficiency,

20
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:18,024
and improving the accessibility
for users of varying abilities.

21
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:24,074
The evolution of these adaptive interfaces
are being conceptualized since 1990s.

22
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:28,344
Recent technologies advances like
machine learning, data analytics

23
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:31,594
have made them more practical
and efficiency in everyday use.

24
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,994
Why AUI's matter in
today's digital landscape?

25
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:39,714
the need of AI adaptive user interfaces
has increased in current time.

26
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:44,264
And this increasing user expectations
is one of the major reason.

27
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:48,794
So the modern users expect more
than just a functional interfaces.

28
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:52,474
They want personalized,
intuitive experiences.

29
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:56,824
As digital experiences grow more
complex, there is a need for

30
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:00,944
interfaces that can adapt in real
time to individual user requirements.

31
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:04,044
There are some challenges
with static interfaces.

32
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:10,244
The traditional interfaces often adapt
one size fits all design, which can fail

33
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,494
to implement the diverse needs of users.

34
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:17,394
AUIs overcome these limitations
by learning, adapting based on the

35
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:20,784
individual behavior, the potential impact.

36
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:26,684
By adapting these user, user preferences,
AUIs can provide a more personalized

37
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:32,644
and efficient experience, leading to
higher satisfaction, fewer errors,

38
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,894
and improved task completion rates.

39
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,914
The key techniques in AUI development.

40
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:41,614
The techniques for developing user
interfaces are personalization.

41
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:45,224
Interfaces adjust based
on detailed user profiles.

42
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:50,584
For example, e commerce platforms like
Amazon recommend products based on users

43
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:52,354
browsing history and purchase history.

44
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,724
The context awareness.

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,279
The interfaces adapt by considering
real time factors such as

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,459
location, time, device type.

47
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,489
For example, Google Maps which changes
its interface based upon whether the

48
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,589
user is walking, driving or in the
pub or using the public transport

49
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,109
or even it goes to a level like
if it's a morning or an evening.

50
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,299
Machine learning algorithms.

51
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,384
Predictive models Help
anticipate user needs.

52
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:25,744
For instance, Spotify playlists
are personalized using machine

53
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:29,504
learning to suggest the music
based on the listening habits.

54
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,624
User feedback loops.

55
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:37,944
Continuous adaption, adaptation is
achieved through the both implicit

56
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:42,784
example time spent on a feature and
explicit feedback that is ratings.

57
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:48,184
Platforms like Duolingo uses this approach
to customize these language exercises.

58
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:49,624
Modular design.

59
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:55,194
Interfaces can rearrange elements
based on usage patterns, allowing

60
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,104
for flexibility customization.

61
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:01,794
Tools like Tableau enables
users to tailor dashboard to

62
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,534
their data analysis requirement.

63
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:08,514
Impact of key techniques on
user engagement and efficiency.

64
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:15,035
DUIs drive engagement and efficiency
much more better and efficient

65
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,284
than the static user interfaces.

66
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,995
The use of adaptive techniques
can significantly boost user

67
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,805
engagement and task efficiency.

68
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:30,774
Here are the few techniques
that contributes to it.
