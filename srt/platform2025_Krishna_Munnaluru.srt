00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,219
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,199
This is Uluru.

3
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:09,010
Today's focus is on building a resilient,
automated monitoring platform for voice or

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,620
IT systems and how this approach reflects
a broader shift in platform engineering.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,525
Clear, reliable voice calls matter,
whether from business or personal chats.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,380
Keeping those systems humming
is no small fe, and this

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,150
presentation shows how it's done.

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,099
The platform predicts issues
before they disrupt calls.

9
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,620
Streamlining work for developers.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,019
Let's start with the big picture.

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:40,719
Platform engineering has evolved
from reactor maintenance to

12
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,609
intelligent predictive operations.

13
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,089
Modern infrastructure demands, monitoring
systems that detect and resolve

14
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,129
issues before end users are affected.

15
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,234
The resolution presented here.

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:57,800
The solution presented here
is a centralized platform that

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,789
emphasizes automation, scalability,
and seamless integration with

18
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:02,899
the development workflows.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,710
This is not just another dashboard
producing endless alerts.

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,869
It is an intelligent system capable
of rapidly identifying genuine

21
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,070
issues, minimizing operational
burden on reducing costs.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,199
The emphasis on secure
service interrupt disruptions.

23
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:21,850
Faster innovation.

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,580
Picture, a monitoring system that
doesn't just flag problems, it

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,440
stops them before they start.

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,820
First, let's explore the
challenges this platform tackles

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,920
monitoring distributed system often feels
like chaos, disconnected tools, also

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,860
alarms and time consuming manual fixes.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,270
IP Systems introduce complex heterogeneous
environments with fragmented visibility.

30
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,289
Traditional monitoring causes alert
fatigue due to false positives while

31
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,390
manual remediation, slow recovery.

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,140
The platform was designed to address all
these problems simultaneously providing

33
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,515
accuracy, speed, and self-op optimization.

34
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:12,025
This platform uses machine learning
to solve real issues, predict trends

35
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:16,885
and learns from past patterns, all
the while cutting through the marks.

36
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:18,465
How does this happen?

37
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,675
It starts with platform
engineering principles.

38
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:26,785
A strong platform should be
invisible, meaning, reliable,

39
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:29,005
stable, and low maintenance.

40
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,815
Platform engineering
builds infrastructure.

41
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:37,155
The developers' log monitoring
infrastructure must be treated as

42
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:42,255
a product with user experience,
reliability, and continuous improvement

43
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:46,745
as core priorities In real time
communications such as voice or ip,

44
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,355
there is no tolerance for delays.

45
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:51,815
Reliability must be absolute.

46
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,415
The platform hangs routine tasks.

47
00:02:54,805 --> 00:03:00,415
Screening developers to focus on
creating with clear insights when needed.

48
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,615
And let's look at
architecture that powers this.

49
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:08,045
Imagine a system built for
flexibility, speed, and handling

50
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,365
any challenging thrown at it.

51
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:13,465
Microservices provide modularity
and independent scaling.

52
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:18,465
Apache Kafka forms the backbone
enabling high throughput fault

53
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,145
tolerance telemetry streaming.

54
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:25,065
A plugin based ingestion layer
collects data from diverse

55
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,105
voiceover IT and environment.

56
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:33,365
Prometheus and Elastic Stack deliver
deeper metrics, logging and visualization.

57
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:39,410
These tools are selected because they
are proven and they're highly scalable.

58
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,110
They're open source.

59
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,600
The architecture ensures scalability
and fault tolerance without redesign.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,960
It is like a toolbox for voiceover.

61
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,080
IP monitoring works with
any setup, no hassle.

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,365
Let's zoom in on how these
pieces come together.

63
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,995
Data flows from call quality metrics.

64
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:01,695
Network indicators and system
performance that will diverse

65
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,575
data into realtime pipelines.

66
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:10,225
Machine learning, analyzes telemetry,
continuously dashboards, alerts,

67
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:14,665
and automated remediation are
produced from this unified flow.

68
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,975
This is not just data collection, it
is continuous learning and adaptation.

69
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:25,145
This diagram maps the journey from raw
wise or IP data to actionable insights.

70
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:31,775
Solve metrics, network stacks, flow
through Kafka, get processes instantly

71
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:37,895
with fine tuned machine learning
models, and appear as dashboards

72
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:41,195
or alerts or automatic fixes.

73
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:47,575
Developers access these insights, writing
their tools, APIs ID plugins, and so on.

74
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:50,354
Machine learning plays a huge role here.

75
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:51,825
Let's dive into that.

76
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,284
Machine learning algorithms, establish
baseline performance patterns and

77
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:58,260
detect subtle degradations early.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,540
False positives are reduced by
distinguishing normal variation

79
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,540
from real issues, quality prediction
models, forecast feature performance

80
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,860
trends, enabling proactive
intervention before users are affected.

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,325
This represents a shift from reactive
monitoring to intelligent production.

82
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,765
If call quality drops, the system knows.

83
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:24,925
If it's a blip or a problem,
avoiding pointless alert, your

84
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:30,475
false alarms and proactive fixes
keep users happy without the chaos.

85
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:35,615
This predicts, this predictive power
needs a fast processing system.

86
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:36,905
Let's check that out.

87
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,195
Using a Lambda architecture,
the system combines.

88
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:44,595
Millisecond level streaming
and it's alerts with batch

89
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,305
analytics for deeper insights.

90
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,955
This platform uses a dual approach,
instant alerts for argent tissue,

91
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:56,105
and deeper analysis for print builtin
back pressure mechanism prove prevent

92
00:05:56,405 --> 00:06:01,510
overload during the traffic spikes event
Correlation identifies root causes.

93
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,060
Minimizing cascading failures
and unnecessary alerts.

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,300
Features like circuit breakers
and event correlation keeps

95
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,510
things steady even during traffic
spikes and pinpoint root causes.

96
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,479
Parting issues is one thing.

97
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:21,450
Fixing them automatically
is where the magic happens.

98
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,280
Issue detection, trigger
automated response.

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,900
Validated remediation actions are selected
based on severity and historical success.

100
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,890
When a glitch appears, the platform
doesn't just send an alert.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,150
It takes the best fix checks
if it's safe, and replace it.

102
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,849
Procedures execute safely with
the drive canary deployments

103
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,380
and rollback mechanisms.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,400
Every action improves feature responses.

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,020
The system continuously learns from
outcomes, delivering self-healing

106
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,945
infrastructure with guardrails.

107
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:01,155
This automation lets teams focus on
building rather than firefighting.

108
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,235
Developers benefit big
time from this setup.

109
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:05,765
Let's see how.

110
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:09,775
Monitoring must enhance, not
hinder developer workflows.

111
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:13,015
The platform is designed
to make developers' lives

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,385
easier, not add complexity.

113
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:20,865
And API first designs offers programmatic
access to the configuration and data.

114
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:25,995
CICD integration deploys monitoring
upgrades alongside application code.

115
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:30,905
Issues can be caught locally
before code ever hits production.

116
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:38,585
Local monitoring and ID plugins provide
realtime insights without extra overhead,

117
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,095
and it's not just user-friendly.

118
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,415
It saves money too.

119
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:46,305
There's no point in developing
intelligent monitoring systems if the

120
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,975
benefits do not outweigh the costs.

121
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,905
It is important to keep the cost low.

122
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:57,755
Smart data management and streamlined
workflows deliver top tier

123
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,185
monitoring without a hefty price tag.

124
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:05,845
Intelligent data lifecycle management
reduces storage costs by 65%.

125
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:10,370
Stream processing optimization
delivers 40% higher efficiency.

126
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,080
Right sizing and workload elimination
achieve 30% reduce resource savings.

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,630
This makes the monitoring both
comprehensive and cost efficient.

128
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,510
This platform doesn't just save costs.

129
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,430
It's built to grow

130
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,570
the platform processes, massive telemetry
volumes with millisecond alerting latency.

131
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,580
Oriental Scaling supports future
growth while predictive scaling.

132
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,240
Anticipates.

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,130
Demand reliability is validated through
load testing, chaos engineering, and the

134
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,230
meta monitoring of the platform itself.

135
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,690
Sophisticated caching and
benchmarking maintain exceptional

136
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,100
performance under stress.

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,700
So how does this get rolled out?

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,770
Let's talk best practices.

139
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,160
Key success factors include
infrastructure as code for

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,070
repeatable, auditable deployments.

141
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,520

deliver quick wins and build confidence.

144
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:22,325
Start small, see quick wins, and
scale up as confidence works.

145
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:25,085
This platform is not standing stake.

146
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:27,295
Let's look at what's next.

friendly spliting infrastructure as a
product enables continuous improvement,

159
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:22,685
scalability, and reliability.

160
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:24,685
It's more than tech.

161
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,775
It's a way to build infrastructure
that teams love, balancing

162
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,364
