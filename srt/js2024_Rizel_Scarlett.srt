1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,710
My talk today is called
No Wallet, No Problem.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,950
How JSON Web Tokens Define the
Future of Mobile Driver's License.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,309
let's get into that.

5
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,499
first off, I want you to envision this.

6
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,309
And you might be familiar with
this if you're a technologist

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,389
or software engineer.

8
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:22,600
You just finished this really big
feature, the type of feature that, You

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,350
promised the sales team and product
managers and customers that this will

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,300
be done in two weeks, but you found
yourself working on it for two months,

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,320
and it went on forever and ever.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,450
And now you're just finally done.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,840
And so you're like, I want to just
unwind, maybe movie and some wine.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,650
I know we're not able to talk back
and forth since we're not in person,

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,490
but just from your perspective, if you
were going to go about this path, would

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,760
you decide you want to order the wine
online or pick it up from the store?

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,760
Feel free to think about that
for yourself or maybe write

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,370
your answer in the comments.

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,090
So in this situation, maybe
let's say you chose that you

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,930
want to order the wine online.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,570
and so when you did that, the app where
you ordered the wine said, Hey, don't

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,600
forget, you need to make sure you show
two items in exchange for the wine.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,500
So give me some of your answers.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,950
What items do you think the
app told you not to forget?

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,870
What two things do you think you
would need in order to get that wine?

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,610
So i'll give you all like the answer since
I can't hear you back but you would need

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,780
money, of course to be able to pay So
maybe you already paid that online or you

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,740
will be paying in person when the delivery
driver comes to you with a credit card

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:45,385
or debit card and then you will also need
Your id and of course you forgot your id,

30
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:50,005
which is super annoying delivery driver
is like man I don't have time for this.

31
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:53,645
I can only spend a certain
amount of time at each house.

32
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,195
So you need to hurry up
So you run up the stairs?

33
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,365
You're like, let me go get my
id before he leaves me and he

34
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,750
can leave but he's whatever I'll
risk getting fired and I'll stay.

35
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,850
I'm being nice person.

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,220
So curious from you all or
just reflect on your own.

37
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,110
Have you ever ordered any alcohol online?

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,330
And what was your experience like?

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,330
I'll dive in deeper to me and who I am.

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,690
My name is Rizal Scarlett.

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,300
I am a staff developer advocate
at a company called TBD.

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,290
Yes, that is the real name.

43
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,480
It's a company owned by block.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,210
So block owns square cash app
title after pay a couple of other

45
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,030
companies, including TVD, and I don't
necessarily drink alcohol, but I

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,910
know some tips on purchasing booze
with a Jason web token, and it'll

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,590
tie into mobile driver's license.

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,220
You'll see if you want it to connect
with me, my handle is at black girl

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,580
bites on most social media platforms.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,810
So we're going to talk about JSON
Web Tokens, we'll talk about a

51
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,840
specific kind of a JSON Web Token,
how it works, how they're being

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
used, the various challenges.

53
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,810
We'll build that special type of JSON Web
Token together, and because we're online,

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,040
we won't be able to do the interactive
fun and the swag, but that is okay.

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,100
You'll still come away
with learning something.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,640
in terms of JSON Web Tokens, the
acronym that people normally use is JWT.

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm not sure, you, from the
audience, if you've known about what

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,500
JWTs are, but I'll go into them a
little bit so you can understand.

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,270
And also, I wanted to let
you know, sometimes you might

60
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,950
hear someone say JWT or JWT.

61
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,680
It just depends on how they prefer.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
I will say JWT.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,630
JWT or JSON Web Token is a
secure way to share information

64
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,380
between two parties online.

65
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,090
So it will often look like
this alpha numeric string.

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,800
But you may notice it has two full
stops to separate different parts of it.

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,820
So the 1st part is the header.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,750
The 2nd part is the payload.

69
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,750
And then the 3rd part is the signature.

70
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,620
So as you can see, the header will
tell us like what type of token

71
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,910
and I'll go to the next slide.

72
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,900
slide here, the header will tell
us what type of token this is.

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,650
So in this case, it's a JSON web
token using the specific algorithm.

74
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,400
And then the payload, which is
the second part will basically be

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,150
the data that we're sending over.

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,480
So in this case, we're sending over
that name is John Doe and whatever IAT

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,400
and sub is we're sending over this.

78
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,645
this string of numbers as well.

79
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,035
And then the last part is also important.

80
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:29,025
This part is the signature and the
signature is verifying that the

81
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,425
data wasn't changed along the way.

82
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:38,535
Now you might have, you might be familiar
with a JSON web token if you've done any

83
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,465
like authorization or authentication.

84
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:45,195
when you're building web applications,
you might have seen like bearer token,

85
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:47,795
and that's oftentimes a json web token.

86
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:51,875
Not all the time, but sometimes now
people often get confused with this.

87
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,255
So I just want to give
people a quick tidbit.

88
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,955
People sometimes get confused
if a json web token is tamper

89
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,505
proof or tamper evident.

90
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,000
So let's figure it out together, right?

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,260
Tamper proof means that something
is designed to completely prevent

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
unauthorized access or changes.

93
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,410
So that means you can't make any
changes if you don't have authority to.

94
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,510
However, tamper evidence says, all
right, you can make some changes.

95
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,470
It shows clear signs of unauthorized
Any unauthorized access or changes

96
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,270
have occurred so you can make
changes, but it will tell on

97
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,910
you if you made those changes.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,870
So we're going to go
ahead and try this out.

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,060
See how this works.

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,120
So I'm going to copy this JSON web
token and we're going to go to JWT.

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,450
io.

102
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,680
And this is a website that I like.

103
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,650
It basically shows us the encoded and
decoded version of a JSON web token.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
and.

105
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,880
Let me zoom out just a bit
so we can see it better.

106
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,570
but this is a website that Auth0
crafted and I really like it.

107
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,840
if we paste this JSON Web Token in,
we can see here on the left side,

108
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,010
the encoded version, and then it
gets decoded on the right side.

109
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,600
Oh, cool.

110
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,580
It's a JSON Web Token using this
specific algorithm, which is cool, right?

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,200
The EDDSA.

112
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
and then it has some
information in it, right?

113
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,645
It tells us, oh, the name in
here, or the data we're sending

114
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,265
over the name's Alice Smith.

115
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:23,565
The completion date is, June, 2024,
June, 18, 2024 expertise level beginners.

116
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:26,635
So that's some of the data we're
sending over and then it shows us

117
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,270
the signature to verify that has.

118
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,890
Like it happened to change along the
way, but let's say I'm like, let me

119
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,650
see if I could try to change the data.

120
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,300
I don't know what some of
these letters are, but I'm

121
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,800
going to be hacking my way in.

122
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,860
And maybe I don't want
it to say Alice Smith.

123
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,210
Maybe I wanted to save result.

124
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,080
So I'm going to try to
delete some letters and type.

125
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,170
Result.

126
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,010
Oh, wow.

127
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,980
We see that the data, the payload
that was being sent over has now

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,670
is now looking a little weird.

129
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,700
We having different characters in
different languages and question marks.

130
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,740
It's giving wingdings from Microsoft Word.

131
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,940
So looking back at that
experience and how things change.

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,410
Do we think that Jason Web tokens
are tamper evident or And the answer

133
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,570
here is that they're tamper evident.

134
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,190
And the reason I say this is because I was
able to change and edit it, but it showed

135
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,790
clear signs that changes had occurred.

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay,

137
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,210
so now I want to talk to you
very quickly about the W3C.

138
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,110
what this stands for, if you aren't
familiar, that stands for W3C.

139
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,480
The World Wide Web Consortium.

140
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,430
So the creator of the World
Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners Lee,

141
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,740
he also helped to form the W3C.

142
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,900
And this is a group of or a
group of groups, a group of

143
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,425
working groups, That are deciding
different standards for the web.

144
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:58,245
So there's setting standards for
how we're going to write CSS on the

145
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:02,415
web, how we're going to approach
accessibility and so on and so forth.

146
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,085
That way, we're all on the same page.

147
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:09,715
There's also a working group for
folks focused on digital identity.

148
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:14,885
As we're moving to a more digital
state, and as things are getting

149
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:19,265
more and more, advanced in terms
of digital, we're also having this.

150
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:26,995
option or this reality where we don't just
prove our identity in physical format.

151
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:30,415
We'll have to also do it
in the digital format.

152
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,455
So there's people coming
together to think about that.

153
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:37,835
So they've come up with a specific
standard called verifiable credentials.

154
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:42,295
And I will describe this for folks
as A special Jason Web token.

155
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,805
so verifiable credentials
officially there.

156
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:49,985
These digital proofs used to confirm
specific facts about individuals,

157
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,565
organizations or entities.

158
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,195
And I like to expand on this a
little bit more just for people to

159
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,545
understand there are basically digital
representations of paper documents.

160
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,105
So like a digital version of your I.

161
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:02,485
D.

162
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,915
Degree driver's license,
health insurance card.

163
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,605
And so here's an example, right?

164
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:08,675
off zero.

165
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:13,895
They do a lot with verifiable credentials
as well as TBD and or they are

166
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:15,735
expanding experimenting a lot with it.

167
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,915
And here's like a little
prototype they made.

168
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,565
So like this could be a verifiable
credential, for an educational

169
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,795
one for a diploma, right?

170
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:29,895
Proving that Hannah Hurwitz got her
diploma, in electrical engineering.

171
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:39,530
She graduated with honors on June 15th,
2019, this will expire in 2025, March 1st.

172
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,580
and she got this in, United States
and it came from Socrates university.

173
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,660
So that's just a little example, right?

174
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,670
And the way it will work is it'll
be a verifiable credential that

175
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,430
gets stored in your phone's wallet.

176
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,050
Kind of like where you store like
your debit card or your, your gym

177
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,490
membership or A ticket to a basketball
game in your Apple pay wallet or your

178
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,180
Google pay wallet, your verifiable
credential could live there as well.

179
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,110
And at the end of the day, many
verifiable credentials, not

180
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,210
all, but many of them are just
cryptographically signed JSON web tokens.

181
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,700
Some of them are using CBOR, which stands
for concise binary object representation.

182
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,500
It really depends on the company and the
purpose of that verifiable credential.

183
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,370
So but We'll talk in terms of Jason web
tokens, because that's the focus today.

184
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,110
So I wanted to let you all know.

185
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,670
Remember that example where I was
talking about ordering alcohol online.

186
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,470
Angie Jones actually did this.

187
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,120
I don't drink.

188
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,460
Alcohol, but my boss, Angie Jones, she
actually told me about this and didn't

189
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,180
talk about this and my mind was blown.

190
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,280
She actually paid our, and got,
alcohol online by showing her mobile

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,960
driver's license on her phone.

192
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,330
So she didn't have her physical ID,
showed it on her phone and behind

193
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,250
the scenes, that technology behind
the scenes of a mobile driver's

194
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,860
license is a verifiable credential.

195
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,720
So I'm curious for anyone in the audience.

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,160
I wish I could see.

197
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:18,025
Your response, but I'm curious
who has a mobile driver's license

198
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:23,995
and who doesn't and we can take
a look at the states in the U.

199
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:24,325
S.

200
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:25,015
right now.

201
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:30,235
And, Canada that are working on mobile
driver's license or implementing them.

202
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,145
the ones in the purple are
the ones that are like.

203
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:37,165
We're we've, we have
mobile driver's license.

204
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:41,355
We like it, or they're like experimenting
with it and stuff like that.

205
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:46,275
The ones in the green are more
in this attempt to execute

206
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,835
legislative study or activities.

207
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:51,465
So they're like, maybe this will
be something that can work for us.

208
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,645
We're going to look into it
legally, with our governments.

209
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:58,895
And then the ones in the gray, like
my state here, womp, they're not

210
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,705
even thinking about it, which sucks.

211
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:01,615
but that's just.

212
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,675
I just like to look at, or there's no
information available, but I just like

213
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:10,465
to look at this just to see the progress
that's happening, in North America, for

214
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,645
adoption of mobile driver's license.

215
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:17,055
So we see that mobile driver's
license, or at least I hope we've

216
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:20,605
seen the mobile driver's license
are convenient in some way.

217
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,935
in addition to oh, they're just in
your phone's wallet and you can pay

218
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,745
for, And buy some alcohol with it, we
saw that educational diploma as well.

219
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:33,635
And I think 1 of another benefit there
in terms of convenience is, let's

220
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:39,925
say, your school shut down, maybe due
to natural disaster, or they just.

221
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,970
Didn't have enough money to go on.

222
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,610
Like these are all realistic
situations that do happen.

223
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,840
and your job wants to call and say,
ask for proof if you really want

224
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,960
there, but there's no one to call.

225
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,710
There's no one to ask proof of.

226
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,200
So you have this verifiable credential
that can withstand the test of time,

227
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,200
withstand that natural disaster
or whatever it's in your phone.

228
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,310
Easy to prove.

229
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,940
Makes your background
check process go easier.

230
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,880
So that's that convenience layer.

231
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,890
But there's also the option or the
idea that there's selective disclosure.

232
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,960
This feature of selective disclosure
with verifiable credentials and.

233
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,520
You don't know what it is,
but I'll explain it to you.

234
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,780
So I don't know how many people here
have watched you on Netflix, but it's

235
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,680
centered around this guy named Joe.

236
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,260
Who's essentially a stalker.

237
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,630
He's very in depth stalker.

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,500
And, I can just imagine if Joe was a.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,750
A bouncer at a club or just
checking your ID for a bar, he

240
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,000
would easily just memorize your
address on your ID and everything.

241
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,470
And so we end up going to bars
and clubs and giving away more

242
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,280
information than we need to.

243
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,750
We don't know how many joes are
out there that are just like,

244
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,410
consuming information about us and
potentially breaching our privacy.

245
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,110
but they really don't
need that information.

246
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,370
They don't need our address.

247
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,950
They don't need, even our full name.

248
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,750
They just need to know that we
are truly over the age of 21.

249
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,320
So there's this feature called
Selective Disclosure where you only

250
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,790
disclose the necessary information
that the verifier is looking for.

251
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,780
So here's an example here.

252
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,260
this is from a different company that
uses verifiable credentials, but this is

253
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,400
a verifiable credential passport, right?

254
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,010
Or a passport in the version in the
format of a verifiable credential.

255
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,960
And what this person is revealing is
their name, Preet Patel, their date

256
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,760
of birth, June 20th, 1989, and their
gender, their male, but they're not

257
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,300
revealing their birth country, how
long they've been a resident, their

258
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,470
identifier, how long this is valid until.

259
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,270
Because that information in whatever
situation they're in is not required.

260
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,550
So it says only the required information
from the credential is shared.

261
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,760
So that's one feature that's really cool
about verifiable credentials, where you

262
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,930
could say, I don't want to share anything
that they actually don't need to know.

263
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,030
We're on a need to know basis.

264
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,600
All right.

265
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,950
So the flow of verifiable credential.

266
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,980
Looks like this.

267
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,880
First off, you need to know the 3
roles that get played in the flow.

268
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,920
So you have an issue where that's
the legal organization or entity that

269
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,230
created and issued and signed the VC.

270
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,010
So not just anyone is just making
VCs up about you or verifiable

271
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,140
credentials up about you.

272
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:38,605
It's usually someone that is trusted
an organization that is trusted.

273
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,885
and then you might have, let's say,
the Department of motor vehicles,

274
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:48,305
a passport office, a college
stuff like that is what's trusted.

275
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,020
Then you'll have the holder or
the subject, which is who the

276
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,930
verifiable credential is about.

277
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,980
And then you have the verifier.

278
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,310
That's the person who, or the
organizations that's requesting proof.

279
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,800
Maybe it's your job requesting proof
that you did get that educational

280
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,740
degree, or maybe it's the bartender, the
delivery app driver that's saying, Hey,

281
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,730
we want to make sure you're over 21.

282
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,820
So we're not actually giving you
alcohol when you, it's not legally.

283
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,510
okay.

284
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,480
So here's like how it would go.

285
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,615
Let's say you go to the DMV.

286
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,875
This is your trusted issuer
that would be able to prove that

287
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,345
yes, you're over the age of 21.

288
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:31,415
then you would ask the DMV hey, or the
DMV would create a verifiable credential

289
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:33,955
for you stating you're over the age of 21.

290
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:38,595
The DMV will digitally sign the
verifiable credential, which

291
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:42,295
will convert the verifiable
credential into a JSON web token.

292
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,305
This way it's tamper evident.

293
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,675
People can't tamper with it.

294
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:50,145
No one can go in and edit it and
say, Oh, I'm changing it because

295
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,055
it'll have proof that it was tried.

296
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:52,925
It was changed.

297
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:55,695
And then you store that JSON
web token in your phone.

298
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:59,495
The show it to the, the verifiable
credential to the bartender.

299
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,935
The bartender scans the VC and
programmatic checks then occur so

300
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:08,665
that the bartender would be the
verifier and they have some checks

301
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:12,615
in the background checking, Is
this verifiable credential expired?

302
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,545
Does this come from a,
issue where we trust?

303
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,675
Is, does this have the information
that we're looking for?

304
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,005
Is this person actually
over the age of 21?

305
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,025
Things like that.

306
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:26,995
So there's those problematic checks in
the background, and maybe the bartender

307
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,345
sees as like a Boolean true or false.

308
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,770
check mark, depending on how the
system set up now, I did talk about

309
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,590
alcohol as a use case for this,
but there's so many additional use

310
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,270
cases that I found interesting.

311
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,100
So I'll just share a couple with you.

312
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,260
one is the pharmaceutical supply chain.

313
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,225
Now, if there's any pharmacists on
listening in, I am still listening.

314
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,355
dumbing this down.

315
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,385
I'm simplifying this.

316
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,845
I'm not in the pharmaceutical
industry, but from what I've learned,

317
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:59,575
from to stay stocked pharmacies,
exchange medicine with each other.

318
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:04,995
So let's say Walgreens says, Oh man, we
ran out of Xanax and they hit up CVS and

319
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,315
CVS is yeah, we can send that to you.

320
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:12,385
But there's a whole process involved
of Okay, first, we need to make sure

321
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:17,465
that the medicine they're sending over,
if it's legit, we need to make sure

322
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:22,005
the pharmacist is legit and we need to
make sure the pharmacy is legit, right?

323
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:27,265
So this process is pretty
long, tedious, annoying.

324
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:33,155
And I recently talked to a CEO of a
farm, of a company that's focused on

325
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,935
verifiable credentials called Sferity.

326
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:41,295
And what they've done is they've enabled,
Pharmacist to be able to use verifiable

327
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:47,205
credentials to prove that medicine is real
to prove that the pharmacist is real and

328
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:51,215
the pharmacy speeding up and streamlining
the process, which I thought was cool.

329
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:56,965
There's also the content
authenticity initiative, and this is.

330
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,920
This is a really cool thing as well.

331
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,950
right now we know in the world a
lot of things are AI generated.

332
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,210
It's really hard to prove.

333
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,370
is this image or video real?

334
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,930
Is this content real?

335
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,900
I don't know.

336
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,310
So with content credentials, you're able
to add this little watermark or have

337
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,040
this little watermark, this little eye on
your images, hover over it, and you'll be

338
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,300
able to get information about the image.

339
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,090
So you'll be able to see, Oh!

340
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,175
This was produced by Jane Smith.

341
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:31,025
and this exists and lives on her accounts
and some other information maybe.

342
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,865
And if it wasn't produced by her,
you'll say it'll give information

343
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,215
that, Oh, this is actually an AI
generated image, just bringing more

344
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:41,485
transparency to what we see online.

345
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,645
And the content authenticity
initiative is so cool.

346
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,355
A couple of companies are
working on this together.

347
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:51,655
Like Adobe, as we've seen Nikon, Sony.

348
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,540
Microsoft, even some news
stations like Fox and all that.

349
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,030
So I'm really excited to see,
how that continues to progress.

350
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,370
I also recently talked to, this to,
a native tribe that's basically using

351
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,790
verifiable credentials to basically
help people within that tribe, establish

352
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,600
their identity and their businesses
through, verifiable credentials, just

353
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,880
proving that, Oh yeah, this is who I am.

354
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,700
This is my.

355
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:24,875
this is my business and they're doing this
for what is called special economic zones.

356
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,435
And then, one of the, I think
this is the last but not least.

357
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:28,655
Yeah.

358
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:32,565
Last but not least is the
European digital identity wallet.

359
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:37,115
Europe is going all in on
embracing verifiable credentials.

360
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,255
And what they're doing is they're
coming out with a digital identity

361
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:44,430
wallet so that all citizens, residents,
businesses have the opportunity.

362
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,950
Option not required, but they have the
ability to store any documents that

363
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,040
they have digitally in their phone.

364
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,750
so this is really cool from their diplomas
to insurance to any travel documents,

365
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,990
just making their lives a little bit more
convenient and securing their privacy.

366
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,235
So I want you to think of
any ideas of what you might.

367
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:11,265
basically use a verifiable credential
for and all you do, I'm going

368
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:15,425
to go ahead and try to build a
verifiable credential with you.

369
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:17,395
If I can exit this.

370
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,285
All right.

371
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,085
what I'm going to do
is I'm going to speak.

372
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:24,205
Move over my, here we go.

373
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:29,075
So right now I'm going to use, and
I'll zoom in just a little bit more.

374
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,905
I'm going to use the web five SDK.

375
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,025
So they have TBD made a couple of SDKs.

376
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,835
This one's called web five credentials.

377
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,225
And what we're going to do is.

378
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:42,335
Build a verifiable credential of our own.

379
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,495
There's other SDKs you can use,
but this one is cool as well.

380
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:47,755
So first I'm going to
go ahead and run this.

381
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:50,505
And what this does is it's
setting up something called

382
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,055
a decentralized identifier.

383
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:56,055
First, this is our unique
identifier that proves who we are.

384
00:21:56,335 --> 00:22:00,525
the URI is simply just a string, but
there's other cryptographic methods

385
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:03,815
that are going on behind the scenes
here that I'm not going to take too

386
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:06,175
much time to explain, but just know.

387
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,360
That it's basically saying
hey, this is this decentralized

388
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,330
identifier is connected to resolve.

389
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,110
Okay.

390
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,330
Next thing we want to do is we want to
actually create our verifiable credential

391
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,750
so we can say something like constant
weight verifiable credential dot create.

392
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,280
And then we're going to put in.

393
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:27,495
The type and we can say this is
a workshop attendee credential.

394
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,185
We're going to say who issued it.

395
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:32,035
So this is a little weird and unorthodox.

396
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:36,065
Probably not a lot of people would do
this or there's not a lot of use cases

397
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,915
for this, but we're going to create
a self signed, verifiable credential.

398
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,845
So I'm going to be the issuer.

399
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,660
And the subject of the verifiable
credential, meaning I'm going to

400
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,650
create the verifiable credential
issue it and give it to myself.

401
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,140
again, so the subject, so this
is my identifier to the issuer

402
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,470
and the subject is me and this is
just for demonstration purposes.

403
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,970
Then we'll put an expiration date as well.

404
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,540
And maybe we want to
add in some data about.

405
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,410
Who this is about.

406
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,830
Oops.

407
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,140
If I could type, so we're
gonna say, let's say maybe name

408
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,210
and My name is Relle Scarlet.

409
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,170
We can say the location
I am in Massachusetts.

410
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,800
We can say conference comp 42, JavaScript.

411
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,940
Aha.

412
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,050
Nope.

413
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,255
JavaScript 2024.

414
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:40,090
And then event date today is
actually, the 10th or the October

415
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,080
25th and issuer name is Rizal.

416
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,030
So I received it and I got it, I sent it.

417
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,570
Okay, so when we see what gets printed
out, it's simply just going to be JSON.

418
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,440
So let's go ahead and console log this.

419
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,060
Console log VC.

420
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,560
So here we see verifiable
credential result.

421
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,190
All of this is just some Jason.

422
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,600
But what we want to do
here is the magic here.

423
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,580
We want to sign the verifiable
credential with our unique identifier.

424
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,700
And that's going to change
this into a Jason Web token.

425
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,530
So we're going to go ahead and run it.

426
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,550
There we go.

427
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,740
We have our signed verifiable credential.

428
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,040
That's a JSON web token.

429
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,440
We can go and evaluate this just to,
just so you know, I'm not lying to you.

430
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,890
Let's make this a little smaller and
I'm going to paste this in and see

431
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,740
if the data that I wrote is in here.

432
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,510
Let's make this.

433
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,690
There we go.

434
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,500
Here we go.

435
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,580
We have my name, Rizal
Scarlett, Massachusetts, the

436
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,140
conference that we're at.

437
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,150
Oops, I messed this up.

438
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,420
The conference that we're
at, the event date, etc.

439
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,900
Alright, we got to see that
this is a real JSON Web Token.

440
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
Let's go back to our code.

441
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,415
and we can present this.

442
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:59,195
So let's say we presented to a verifier
and we want to save it in our phone.

443
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:04,435
So I'm going to go ahead and drag this
over and this is like a demonstration.

444
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:05,545
So we'll paste this in.

445
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:10,965
We'll say present our credential
and we can check the console.

446
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,465
Whoa, super huge.

447
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,995
I made this big, so you
all will be able to see it.

448
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:15,475
Cool.

449
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:21,485
All right, and what we got back, I'll
zoom in a little bit more on this side

450
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:27,765
is our verifiable credential that I'm
storing in my phone where I'm like,

451
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:32,165
okay, this is Rizal, comp 42 event date.

452
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,655
I think I put the 24th
of October when I met.

453
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,430
25th or whatever.

454
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,330
That's cool.

455
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,950
And then, I can switch this verifiable
credential to prove that, yeah, I

456
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,040
attended a workshop and I want to get
swag back for it or whatever the case is.

457
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,270
this is the idea around verifiable
credentials, how they work,

458
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,380
how JSON Web tokens are, that
technology behind the scenes.

459
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,970
None of this is something new.

460
00:25:56,315 --> 00:26:02,695
Or it's not using new technology, but it's
creating a new experience for everyone.

461
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:07,795
so I would encourage you, if you
would like to dig deeper into stuff

462
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:09,725
like this, to go to developer.

463
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,885
tbd.

464
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:15,145
website and you can learn more about
how verifiable credentials work.

465
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:15,940
what are they?

466
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,760
We have this awesome video on it, how to
issue verifiable credentials and more.

467
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,770
it's really good documentation,
good reading to understand

468
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,910
and learn how this works.

469
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,010
I want to thank comp 42 for giving
me the platform to speak and I want

470
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,560
to thank you as well for listening.
