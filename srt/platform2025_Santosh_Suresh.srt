00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,569
Hello friends, this is Santos.

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:07,529
I'll be presenting on scaling medical
imaging infrastructure for life

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,509
critical healthcare applications.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,020
We describe how advanced flexible
endoscopy uses this architecture.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,640
The agenda platform
architecture, fundamentals.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,470
What is the core infrastructure?

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,920
Real time video processing pipelines.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,990
What are the storage?

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,900
Arctic architecture design principles.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,580
Then performance engineering
and availability.

11
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,230
What are the scaling strategies,
optimization techniques,

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,239
and how do you recover?

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,010
From disaster during a procedure.

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,550
What are the data management
and integration tools we use?

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,880
How are they connected to the cloud?

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,440
What is the security and
compliance we are following?

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,520
Then we end with case studies
and future directions.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,919
See when the medical platform fail,
patients are directly impacted.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,470
The momentary system.

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,850
Lag in bronchoscopy could mean
missing a critical airway lesion

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,120
that could be even cancerous.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,970
A storage failure might result
in lost or lost diagnostic

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,580
imagery that cannot be recreated.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,560
So more what are the technical challenges?

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,575
So the stream bandwidth, the
single procedure produces massive

26
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,695
amount of uncompressed data sets.

27
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:38,064
The latency, the end-to-end photon latency
should be less than 200 milliseconds

28
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:43,894
in best case scenarios, we have systems
with 90 to one 20 millisecond latency.
