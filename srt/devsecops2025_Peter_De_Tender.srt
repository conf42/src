00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,900
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome to the com 42
DevSecOps 2025 conference.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,550
Thank you for joining my session
on GitHub Advanced Security.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,770
A lap around GitHub depend upon code,
QL and other built-in security features.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,080
I'll start the session with a quick
introduction to DevSecOps, followed

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,550
by different GitHub security features,
starting from sharing several

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,620
repositories, security best practices.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,009
You'll learn about secret
scanning, vulnerability scanning,

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,870
and advanced code scanning.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,850
All available within GitHub today.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,860
Each topic, we'll have several live
demos to illustrate how this all works.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,900
So my name is Peter Deten, originally
from Belgium, but managed to move

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,990
to the red area, close to the
Microsoft campus almost four years

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,324
ago to continue my role as a lead
technical trainer in the West US team.

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,710
What we're doing out of the role is
helping our top larger customers across

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,720
the globe in virtual workshops learning
about Azure and in meantime, a lot

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,479
of DevOps as well as AI and co-pilot.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,340
You got my contact details here on the
slide, and I would say don't hesitate

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,630
reaching out if you have any questions
related to the session or maybe

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,090
broader GitHub DevOps or psych DevOps.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,440
So I think with that, let's get
started with the first section,

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,660
the what and Why of DevSecOps.

23
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:32,169
While DevOps is primarily focusing on the
collaborative culture between developers

24
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,549
and operations teams, the ultimate
goal is really automating everything.

25
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,840
Automating yourself.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,419
Now the flow looks a bit like this.

27
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,009
Developers write code.

28
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,764
Where the code gets validated and
from there gets packaged during

29
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:48,264
what we call the build stage.

30
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:52,104
And if you automate this a bit more,
it's what we call the ci continuous

31
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:54,565
integration part of the pipelines.

32
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,985
From there, the application
code gets moved into what I

33
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,875
describe as a running state.

34
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,565
This could be across different
environments, dev and tests, staging,

35
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:08,755
production to ultimately get taken
over, managed by the operations team.

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,040
And again, trying to automate as much
as possible now if we follow this

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,040
stream, but now integrating security,
that's DevSecOps now where it means

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,530
that we will try and integrate as many
security capabilities as possible in

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,420
each and every stage of the cycle.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,829
The list is getting pretty long and
obviously I'm gonna talk about some of

41
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,570
these features throughout my session.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,030
Now talking about security features,
let's have a look at GitHub

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,430
repositories, security best practices.

44
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:49,045
Building applications usually starts
with source control or version control,

45
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,745
using, in this case, GitHub repositories.

46
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:55,315
Even on repo level, there's
already quite some security

47
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,325
best practices that I can share.

48
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:02,605
For example, use security policies
to guide collaborators on maintaining

49
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:07,495
code set security policies on branches,
protecting Maine as we call it.

50
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:12,295
And you can add security features on
organization and enterprise level.

51
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:16,555
Another recommendation is
using secret variables instead

52
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,385
of storing secrets in code.

53
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,800
But if you do, I got a
solution for that later on.

54
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,950
While not immediately security related
from a secure your code perspective,

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,140
it is recommended to provide security
documentation inside your repos.

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,640
Now, what this means is that you're
gonna add details, for example, in

57
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,160
the Read me Markdown, adding a code of
contact markdown, and overall adding

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,600
the contributing markdown files,
especially for open source projects.

59
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,040
But I could also recommend this.

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,740
For private repos if you are using
that inner sourcing concept as well.

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,940
And maybe another recommendation
here is creating that security

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,710
markdown file containing how your
project handles security overall.

63
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,900
It'll also show up in that navigator
menu to the right of each and every repo.

64
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,250
That's pretty much it for best practices.

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,170
I hope I teased your interest.

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,010
From here, I'm gonna jump into
my demo environment and walk you

67
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,600
through a couple of those features.

68
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,030
So for this first demo, I'm gonna
walk you through some of those

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,880
repository security best practices.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,340
Now I created a sample repo that is
publicly available, so you can go in

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,600
and maybe validate some settings or copy
the code and then maybe replicating it.

72
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,465
In your own environment.

73
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:46,435
So I call this super original,
the com 42 DevSecOps demo repo.

74
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:52,165
Now, one of the first things that we
talked about in, in like security best

75
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,925
practices is probably permissions.

76
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,620
Now the first level is
a public people pre.

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,600
A public repo or a private repo.

78
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,410
So from there, I assume
that's pretty clear, but then

79
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,660
next we go in our settings.

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:15,220
And over here, since this is a public
repo, we might define who can collaborate,

81
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,810
who we're gonna invite, and what are
some of the other moderation options.

82
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,249
So if we move to collaborators,
you can see over here that it

83
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,960
expects like direct access.

84
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,510
It's a public repo, as
you can see over here.

85
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,820
And down here, I could explicitly
invite people who could now collaborate.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
Now you could think wait a
minute, Peter, it's a public repo.

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,570
Doesn't it mean that
everyone can just contribute?

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,240
Contributing is not exactly
the same as collaborating.

89
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,725
So this means, for example,
they can manage repost, they can

90
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:51,440
manage permissions depending what
permissions you're gonna give them.

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
And then underneath
the moderation options.

92
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:01,115
I think another interesting one is
defining who can perform some code

93
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:06,905
reviews, where maybe limiting users to
read or higher access could be a good one.

94
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:11,375
So that's just mainly
the user permissions.

95
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:16,745
Another interesting one is, if I
go back to my code level, is that

96
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,485
as mentioned in the presentation.

97
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:23,405
GitHub is now detecting that
the branch is not protected.

98
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:27,485
So what that means is that basically
anyone with the correct permissions

99
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:33,515
obviously could now move in and not
taking security into consideration

100
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:37,065
and maybe forcing a push overriding
code, which I don't want.

101
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,485
Maybe deleting the repo or
changing anything else that,

102
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:44,745
again, we are not really seeing
as a good security, best practice.

103
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:51,525
So what we can do is go into
protecting the branch, and then from

104
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:56,565
there we're bumping into that rule
sets or what I call branch policies.

105
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:01,935
I got an extensive multi-year Azure DevOps
platform background, still using it.

106
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:06,135
Mainly training now on the two
platforms and somehow I still

107
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,815
call this branch policies.

108
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:14,115
So what we can do here is obviously,
for example, what I would recommend

109
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:18,615
is protect main, and that means
we're gonna protect the main branch.

110
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:24,435
We're not allowing any bypass, and
we're gonna identify the target branch.

111
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:29,655
Now, just a little piece
of advice here is, whoops.

112
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:36,495
You would typically do protect the
default branch, but there might

113
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:40,455
be scenarios where if you have
multiple branches, that although

114
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:44,415
the main branch should be considered
default, that's not always the case.

115
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:49,635
So that's where I would recommend
using both default branch and

116
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,675
including by pattern where then I
would add the main branch into it.

117
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,380
So from here, just adding like main
into it would be good enough if

118
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,650
you're wondering what the difference
is with the default branch.

119
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,240
Since I do have a few
here, if I go into branches

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,660
and actually from here, I go into my
branch view, this is what we need.

121
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:22,925
For any of my branches, you can
see that we can change the default.

122
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:28,805
So right now my default is up here and
it's the main branch, but nothing would

123
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:31,565
stop me to go in any of my other branches.

124
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:35,915
And then from here flagging it
and defining it as the default.

125
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:41,915
So that's where in the rule set, I
actually like the two options to not only

126
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:47,195
protect the default, but also protect,
any other branch based on the naming.

127
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:53,075
Now let me go back to those
rules and show you a few of, I

128
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,455
would say the common settings.

129
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,405
So we create a new branch rule set.

130
00:08:56,795 --> 00:09:00,785
You could add tagging as well, where the
difference is that not every tag is linked

131
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:02,405
to a branch or the other way around.

132
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:07,385
So once we define the setting.

133
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:14,495
As you can see here, by default, we
have restrict deletions and block force

134
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,605
push, but obviously there are a whole
bunch of other options and it's not

135
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,505
up to me to tell you which ones you
should enable or not, because I think.

136
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:28,975
It's pretty specific, but for example
a few ones that I usually enable is

137
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:33,175
restricting creations, which means
that not just everyone can create a

138
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:37,855
new branch, which might not be exactly
following the open source mindset,

139
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,235
but there might be valid scenario.

140
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:44,435
And then the other one I like that
I'll talk about a little bit later

141
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:48,605
on is requiring code scanning
results and code quality results.

142
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,720
And another pretty cool one.

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,790
If you are already using GitHub,
copilot generative FAI is automatically

144
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,140
requesting a code review, and I'll
show you some outcome of that later on.

145
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,000
Which, by the way, if you do not use
GitHub copilot yet, it's one of those

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,160
magical tools I call them in meantime.

147
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,790
So I could definitely recommend
you to start looking into it.

148
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,420
If you have a personal GitHub account,
you can enable copilot for free.

149
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,950
If you have an enterprise account,
you need to talk to your business

150
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,060
and trying to convince them
to invest in GitHub copilot.

151
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,600
I would say

152
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,500
another option that could be pretty
useful is back in the settings,

153
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:40,370
moving into the security section
over here and selecting actions.

154
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:48,245
Inside actions, you can now create secret.

155
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,035
You can now create secret
environment variables.

156
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:58,475
So pretty cool.

157
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:03,755
Again, we try to avoid having any secrets
or any other strings if you want, inside

158
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:08,075
our code where you could use traditional
variables, which means they're not

159
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
protected, they're not encrypted.

160
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:14,075
But if you move them into the secret
tab here, they will be encrypted.

161
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,605
We're almost there with secret
recommendations, but the last one I

162
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:24,635
would recommend is creating any of
those additional files where one of the

163
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:32,645
files we would add here is the security,
and the way it works is you define it,

164
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:40,475
security MD. In here you provide best
practices for security, which probably

165
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,515
should be a little bit more extensive.

166
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,645
You commit your changes

167
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:53,855
and from here, the nice thing is that now
everyone moving just to the repo gets this

168
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,435
little link here to your security policy.

169
00:11:56,435 --> 00:12:00,725
It's the same for the code of the conduct
and some of the other system files.

170
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,875
And then down here you also, whoops.

171
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:04,955
You also have the,

172
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,075
sorry for that.

173
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:16,295
You also have the security placeholder
over here, and again, in open source,

174
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:19,825
but inner source projects I think
it's pretty useful to have those.

175
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,255
So that's I would say hopefully a
pretty cool demo for over all of you.

176
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,130
Quick introduction to some
security best practices.

177
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,670
Permissions using collaborators, the
rule sets or branch policies, secret

178
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,060
variables, and security markdown file.

179
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,195
With that, I'm gonna move
on with the presentation.

180
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:42,495
Now, as mentioned earlier, a
pretty, pretty powerful feature

181
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:45,135
GitHub provides is secret scanning.

182
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,645
So I would say, let's have
a look what that actually is

183
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,355
about in this next section.

184
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,635
Now, as you can imagine from the title,
this feature allows you to scan your

185
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:58,125
repositories for secret strengths.

186
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:01,035
There's a pretty long list
in the GitHub documentation,

187
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,405
listing up all the supported.

188
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,590
Partners and platforms of which
secret strings are getting detected.

189
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,980
So you can think of AWS S3 storage
keys, Azure Access Keys, API, keys

190
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,530
Connection Strings, but also Broader
Secrets using SSH Keys and the like.

191
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,250
The GitHub documentation,
again, has a pretty long list.

192
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,220
I don't memorize any of them,
but I typically check them out.

193
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:30,085
And they're partly embedded
in the setup as well.

194
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,985
So by default, the secret
protection scans the repo.

195
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:39,235
So basically when your secret's already
in the repo, now there is an additional

196
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,375
setting, and I'll show you in the demo
that we call push protection, which

197
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:48,635
can be prevented uploading secrets as
part of your synchronization tasks.

198
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,405
And obviously avoiding that any secrets
arrive in the repo, which means you don't

199
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:55,325
really have to scan for them anymore.

200
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,115
And I've talked about it.

201
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:03,355
Let's say, I'm gonna jump to my next
demo here and it just because I wanna

202
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:04,945
show you actually how this works.

203
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,620
So for the secret scanning here,
were backend, the repo, still

204
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,390
in the same repo as before.

205
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,760
MyCom 42 DevSecOps demo.

206
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,980
And we're gonna enable secret scanning.

207
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,420
So how does it work?

208
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,040
We move to the security tab and down here.

209
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,450
Although it's the last one in the list,
I always like to start with this one,

210
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,570
where now we have secret scanning enabled.

211
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
You could go into

212
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,290
secrets and then from
here you would enable it.

213
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,390
Now, when you enable it, it's
gonna offer you the setting to

214
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,060
use the push protection as well.

215
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,550
And I'll show you in another
part what that means.

216
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,330
Now.

217
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,985
If I move into my code

218
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:21,095
and let me add something, little web app,
I go in my index and all the way down.

219
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:24,665
I already have a little string, but
it's not a hundred percent secret.

220
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,210
This is GitHub token, where if
you do anything with GitHub tokens

221
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,940
they have the GitHub Pat Personal
Access Token as the syntax.

222
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,260
Where now, if I

223
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,550
commit my changes.

224
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,790
As you can see, I'm using
copilot pretty frequently.

225
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,060
It's pretty convenient here
because it's already helping

226
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,470
me with my commit messages.

227
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,380
I tried to commit and now here you
can see that my secret scanning

228
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,020
found is GitHub personal access
token on line 35 in my code.

229
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,920
Now from here, we could move on with
a couple of different settings, which

230
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,660
I guess are pretty straightforward.

231
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,660
You can flag like it's a false positive.

232
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,839
I'm using it in a test or why
not in a demo, or it's fine.

233
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,189
I know that I shouldn't do this, but I'll
fix it later, which is an interesting one

234
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,040
to me because it's bypassing the baseline.

235
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,500
Of having security protection
in the first place.

236
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:31,540
So I wouldn't recommend that one, but
I can still see like maybe some of you

237
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,250
might look into it and even then, if you
do this, I'll fix it later, which means

238
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,860
the secret string will go into the repo.

239
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,640
I'll talk about some other
scanning mechanism later on that

240
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,199
allows you to still detect it.

241
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,310
I'm not gonna save it for now,
but I hope that makes sense.

242
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Now you might think, okay, Peter,
you are editing files from within.

243
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:53,760
GitHub directly.

244
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,200
Who's actually developing
code from this view?

245
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,639
Maybe you might use code spaces.

246
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,680
Maybe you do vs code.

247
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Maybe you do something
else on your local machine.

248
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,560
So what we can do, and
that's the push protection.

249
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,050
If I shift to my exact same view, this
is the same code, nothing's changing.

250
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,429
I could now try and inject.

251
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,145
Again, that secret string.

252
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,254
So I'm gonna grab it.

253
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:21,754
I have it here on the site.

254
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,935
I move into my index file.

255
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:30,605
I add it in my code somewhere in
any possible file, doesn't matter.

256
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,544
And then go in my source control.

257
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,064
I'm gonna sync my changes.

258
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:41,375
And as you can see here, it tells me
like, whoops, something is not working.

259
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:46,115
But now if we check the comment
output, it's telling me here whoops.

260
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,845
The push feature cannot contain secrets.

261
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:55,955
So instead of trying to update your
code from the repo perspective, this is

262
00:17:55,955 --> 00:18:00,875
now happening before you try to push,
which I think is definitely convenient.

263
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:04,565
So that's, I would say, pretty
much it on secret scanning.

264
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:07,290
So showed you the secret
scanning, how to enable it.

265
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:13,340
Showed you the impact from the GitHub
view, little popup message, warning

266
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,610
you with a couple of options, and
then showing you the same from the

267
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,340
code view in my VS code as well.

268
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,220
So with that, let's move
on with the presentation.

269
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,040
So with that, let me move to the
next section, covering dependency and

270
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,840
vulnerability scanning using GitHub.

271
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,100
Depend Bott.

272
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,960
So GitHub Depend.

273
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,880
Bot is a built-in service for any
repost public private, which allows

274
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,350
for scanning repo package dependencies
and corresponding vulnerabilities.

275
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,680
Now, by default, it's using the cve.org
public database of already publicly known

276
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,360
vulnerabilities, together with obviously
GitHub advanced security patterns itself.

277
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,730
You can enable Pena Bot from the security
settings, and I'll show you in a demo

278
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,410
of that repo in basically just a couple
of seconds and after a few minutes it

279
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,560
starts running GitHub actions pipeline,
providing you detailed overview of any

280
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,750
detected vulnerabilities, listing up
the criticality, and even including a

281
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,090
possible fix to mitigate the problem.

282
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,070
And as obviously another
demo is coming up for it.

283
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:27,235
So this next one is the
depend bot code scanning.

284
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:33,415
So we move again once more to
the security tab over here and

285
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,855
we move to depend bot.

286
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,995
As you can see, once we move
into the security options, I

287
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,975
would enable depend about here.

288
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,640
And then maybe some other options
if you want to use them, is the

289
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,440
private vulnerability reporting.

290
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,530
It's not the scanning, it's
pretty obvious out of the naming,

291
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,540
it's the reporting itself.

292
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,420
So we would move in, enable,
depend bot, and from here again,

293
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,850
we have a whole bunch of options.

294
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,270
The ones that I recommend most,
and I'll show you a little bit

295
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,520
of that, is the dependency graph.

296
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,650
Then obviously within depend bot.

297
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:14,395
It's not just enabling all or nothing.

298
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:17,064
You have a lot of flexibility here.

299
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:22,195
So we would enable the depend
bot alerts, and then it tells

300
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,245
me like, oh, pretty cool.

301
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:26,965
We also need to enable the dependency
graphs so I don't have to worry about it.

302
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:32,155
We can define specific depend bot
rules, meaning if you don't like to

303
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,875
use just the ones you get from the
built in GitHub, advanced security.

304
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,080
You could now add your own rules.

305
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:43,570
You could focus on specific security
updates, like as part of pull requests,

306
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,860
you can do version updates, and then
it's gonna integrate some little

307
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,980
task that's called depend Bot inside
your github.com system folder.

308
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,199
So again, pretty flexible.

309
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,840
I'm not gonna walk you through
all options because we don't

310
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,460
really have the time for that.

311
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,679
But what happens from here if.

312
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:13,050
You enable, it's gonna trigger a
scanning where for now we don't see

313
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,730
the outcome yet, but that's where
I can switch to another demo repo.

314
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,200
And again, it's a public one, so
feel free to have a look into it.

315
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,470
It's called the bot demo.

316
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,110
I enabled just the exact same settings
couple of days ago, as you can see.

317
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,640
Where now if I move back to
security, I select the pan bot.

318
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,570
This task was already completed where
now it's telling me like, whoops,

319
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,580
Peter, in your sample code here,
you have a few security issues.

320
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,650
The security issue, I'm just gonna
grab one of these, is again, based

321
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,090
on those public CVEs together with
GitHub advisory database as well.

322
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,400
It usually looks into
your development package.

323
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,560
It is aware about any versioning
challenges or versioning issues, and in

324
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,870
this case, it also tells me that there
is a potential solution to move up my

325
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,330
package version to a later one, and that
should fix the problem here on the site.

326
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,220
Pretty relevant information.

327
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,410
What is the attack vector?

328
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,850
What is the complexity?

329
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,230
What is the severity?

330
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,050
And if we move down a little bit
more, we can see the C-V-E-I-D.

331
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,580
I'll talk about that in a second.

332
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:35,100
And down here we could also pick up the
GitHub advisory database information.

333
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,990
So this specific example, and
again, it's just a demo, right?

334
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:46,110
But it's related to comment, injection
in low dash, which is like a specific

335
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,880
package that we used for the demo.

336
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:53,565
And we can list up all the references
from different security and non-security

337
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,955
vendors I talked about@cve.org.

338
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:01,545
And if you've never seen that
before, let me grab this CVE number.

339
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,845
You can do c v.org.

340
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,805
In this example, which I used in
another demo couple of days ago to test.

341
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,199
Was searching for SQL injection,
and as you can see, it's listing

342
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:19,469
up all the 2025 security problems.

343
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:27,390
And obviously it goes all the way back
since my previous example was 2021 and

344
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,340
a specific number here in the sequence.

345
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,910
You can also find all details here,
so it's partly coming from that public

346
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,460
CVE database, and then maybe additional
information from the GitHub advisory.

347
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:51,090
Last part, if I switch back to my
code view and I go into insights and I

348
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,170
navigate to the pendency graph over here.

349
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,010
Since we enabled the pan bot,
remember, it tells me it'll

350
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,170
also enable dependency graph.

351
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,440
It's now not only showing me the
individual problematic package, but

352
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,900
it's also showing any other dependencies
where for some of you it might also

353
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,840
be relevant to export the sbo, and
that's gonna give you a JSO file with

354
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,450
all details from all your packages.

355
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,220
Looks a little bit weird here, but.

356
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,710
You can say that it's a pretty
extensive, detailed JSO file.

357
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,560
So pretty useful, pretty cool I would say.

358
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,900
And that's in short what Pena Bot was
about, at least the part that I wanted

359
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,420
to show you in just a couple of minutes.

360
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,940
So with that, let's move on
with the last part of the

361
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,400
presentation, talking about code ql.

362
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,380
Awesome.

363
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,850
This brings me to the last section
for this presentation detailing GitHub

364
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,070
code QL proprietary code security
scanning tool from GitHub itself.

365
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,450
Code QL tries to treat your repository
code like data, starting from creating a

366
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,030
database and using what I call queryable
data that you extract from your code base.

367
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,400
You can create your own custom queries
or rely on a set of standard queries

368
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,710
provided by GitHub research teams, as
well as community contributions for any

369
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,870
common possible development language.

370
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,360
Using Code ql, you can detect security
issues, coding errors, and overall

371
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,645
using custom que. Another cool feature
is using code QL comment line on your

372
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:40,845
development workstation, or what I'll
show you in the demo is integrating

373
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:45,495
code QL as a visual studio code
extension, which means that now your

374
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:50,565
developers, or maybe you, yourself as
a developer, can perform scanning tasks

375
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:53,145
before even merging code into the repo.

376
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,580
Which brings me to my last demo for
the presentation, showing you how to

377
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,400
set up code QL in GitHub, first of all.

378
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,690
And then from there I'm gonna
jump into some vs code extension

379
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,250
configuration settings.

380
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,670
And what I did here is once more
go into security, selecting code

381
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,230
scanning, and then here also
obviously enabling code scanning.

382
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:24,135
Now what that's doing is
actually building an actions

383
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,945
pipeline so we can go into code.

384
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:33,525
If you know a bit about GitHub actions
pipelines, you should know that they're

385
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:38,715
stored in the dot GitHub workflows
folder, and inside we have a code ql.

386
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:44,205
You can modify this because it's
following obviously a lot of

387
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,545
the traditional common pipeline.

388
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,870
Syntax and use cases.

389
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,890
So we have the on keyword, which means
it's a trigger, automatic trigger

390
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,860
whenever we have any of these operations.

391
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,350
And you can make this a lot more filtered,
not just the main branch, but any branch.

392
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,110
Or you could also use a schedule
task or use the workflow dispatch.

393
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,480
And that means it's a manual trigger.

394
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:13,995
Now in this case, again, it's
based on the built-in capability.

395
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:19,385
So it means whenever we have some PR
push-pull operations against the main

396
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,605
branch, we gonna run the code scanning.

397
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,275
Then the code scanning itself.

398
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:28,895
If it's the first time you use
it, I would heavily recommend you

399
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:34,235
to look into those details where
it's becoming part of a pipeline.

400
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,705
This is a separate pipeline, but in a
real world scenario, I could imagine.

401
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:44,075
That you're integrating the
syntax into your build pipeline.

402
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:48,605
When someone is committing code
out of a pr, out of the PR review,

403
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:51,425
you would run a CI built pipeline.

404
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:55,565
And part of that is obviously
validating code, like a dotnet

405
00:27:55,565 --> 00:28:00,115
run.net dotnet restore.net
publish to create the artifact.

406
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:04,555
And then maybe from there, integrating
the code scanning or like in this

407
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:07,795
example, running it as a scheduled
task would also be beneficial.

408
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,790
Since we talked about some security
best practices, one of the things

409
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:17,110
I didn't mention, but inside your
pipeline you could actually also

410
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,879
define permission limitations.

411
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,230
So in this case, the read action
items here means that the pipeline

412
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,690
runs cannot change anything in code.

413
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:33,905
The actual scanning is happening a
little bit more below where Over here

414
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:36,365
we identify what is the language.

415
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:40,025
And again, code QL supports
most common languages.

416
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:46,745
So you can read through the, read me here
to identify which language you wanna scan.

417
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,250
And then a little bit more down,
we have the actual code actions.

418
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,270
So it starts with code, ql,
action, initializing it.

419
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,820
So that's basically recognizing the
language, the build mode, and then

420
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,800
a little bit further, it's running.

421
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,430
I'm challenged a bit with my view.

422
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,500
I'm gonna try and zoom in again.

423
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:16,055
Where then after the initialization,
it's running the actual code

424
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,365
scanning, so that's the analysis.

425
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:23,665
So nothing really different from any
other pipeline syntax, I would say.

426
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:30,504
Where then if we look into the actions
view itself, we have code QL advanced,

427
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:35,544
and then here you can see based on my
operations, like adding my security

428
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:38,215
file, it's triggering and scanning code.

429
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:44,169
If you look inside the code
itself, then there's two tasks.

430
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,409
Why?

431
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:50,139
Because this sample has two different
code frameworks, one for net C sharp,

432
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:53,139
another one for JavaScript, and
it's obviously looping through them.

433
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:59,320
And then inside we can see the code QL
initialized, and then performing the

434
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,870
analysis and then basically wrapping up.

435
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:07,810
If we look inside the code analysis,
it's gonna show you the details.

436
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:15,025
And that brings us back into
the security tab, code scanning.

437
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:19,405
And then here you can see for the
different languages what got detected.

438
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:24,715
And I just like a, I would say a clean
or a green view, which means there are

439
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:30,835
no security issues detected, but I was
assuming that it's pretty straightforward.

440
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,705
So you can look into the scanning results.

441
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,105
You can open up the.

442
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:40,615
More detailed view for any
of these running the queries.

443
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:45,865
And this is where you can see like
what code is actually getting scanned.

444
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:49,465
Now what you see here is those QLX files.

445
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:54,925
So those are the query language,
code, query code, QL query language.

446
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:58,615
And the nice thing is that although
this is all running from within the

447
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:02,965
GitHub backend, what if we wanna
move this a little bit more to

448
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:05,340
the left in the DevSecOps story.

449
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,760
What I'm leaning into is what
if we can move code QL to

450
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,440
our development workstation?

451
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,570
And that's exactly what we can do.

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,230
Where if I switch back to my code
application here, this is still from our

453
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,930
secrets, so not gonna use that anymore.

454
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,580
But now I can go into VS code and
installing the code QL extension.

455
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,430
There's also code QL command line if.

456
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:38,165
You don't have yes code or you
don't use the extensions that much.

457
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:41,285
You could do similar
tasks using command line.

458
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:46,295
So after installing the extension
and navigating to it, it's

459
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:47,855
gonna give you a few options.

460
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:50,585
Like what development
language you already know.

461
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:52,415
I'm using T net C sharp.

462
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:58,145
I'm gonna download a cloud-based, GitHub
based database, which is called the

463
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,605
Rest Sharp, at least for C Sharp code.

464
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:05,975
And it comes with a sample query
and I can pull up some other top 10

465
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,535
repositories if I would like to use that.

466
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:13,725
What I did is navigating to my
example query, and then, as you can

467
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,785
see here, I'm searching for a secret.

468
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:20,460
Not really, I would say
necessary, but just an example.

469
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,210
Where we already know
that we have that secret.

470
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,810
But if you don't have that secret
scanning enabled or you don't have the

471
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,580
push enabled, or you flag it as, I'll
fix it later, which I did in one of my

472
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,800
demos, you could now go I'm gonna rely
on code QL to actually detect it for me.

473
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,149
So from here, we're gonna run the query.

474
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,850
It's probably not gonna
take all that long,

475
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,080
and I could actually navigate to.

476
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,360
My previous scan in prep for the
demo, and you can see that out

477
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,970
of the code QL database, it's not
finding that text string 115 times.

478
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:06,360
It's detected by 115 different
prebuilt C sharp queries where all

479
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,400
of them recognize the secret string.

480
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,390
That's the main thing.

481
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:14,594
Where the cool thing is that it's
not just scanning for secrets, it's

482
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:16,425
scanning for pretty much anything.

483
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:21,014
So you could obviously do a lot
more with the code QL language.

484
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:24,824
Just wanted to bring an easy
example that's probably relatable

485
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:26,625
to any kind of scenario.

486
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:30,405
But with that, I think I'm gonna
wrap it up to make sure I'm not

487
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:31,905
running out of time too much.

488
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:33,835
But let's switch back to the presentation.

489
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:35,275
Whew.

490
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:40,045
I'm quite happy with all this, especially
because all my demos worked as expected.

491
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:44,125
Now we're close to the end of my
session where I shared information about

492
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:49,585
DevSecOps give you a set of repository
security best practices, followed by

493
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:51,595
more detailed insights on GitHub's.

494
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:56,755
Security features like secret scanning
depend about vulnerability scanning and

495
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,425
advanced code scanning using code ql.

496
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,810
All those features are part of GitHub
Advanced Security capabilities.

497
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,980
I hope you enjoyed learning
about GitHub security features.
