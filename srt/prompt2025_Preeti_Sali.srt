00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,690
Hello everyone and thank you for joining.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,640
I Am pri, and today we'll explore how
cloud-based telematics is reshaping

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,620
the way we manage commercial fleets,
driving efficiency, sustainability,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,660
and deep operational insights.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,550
Fleet management used to be about
keeping vehicles on the road.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,020
Now it's about connecting every
vehicle driver and route into

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,850
a single intelligent ecosystem.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,470
I'll walk you through the technologies
real world resolve and where the

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,330
future of connected fleets is heading.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,060
And I'm pleased to talk about it in the
com 42 Prompt Engineering 2025 conference.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,820
But before that, let me introduce myself.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,670
I am a senior technical program
manager at Ford Motor Company at Ford.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,870
I lead initiatives that combine
cloud infrastructure, IOT,

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,850
and analytics to transform.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,720
How we manage mobility systems, my focus
is mostly to build scalable, secure,

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,160
and intelligent telematics platforms
that enables proactive decision making

17
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,110
and measurable return on interest.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,869
This work touches everything from
predictive maintenance to sustainability

19
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:15,339
tracking, bringing together data
technology and human behavior

20
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,500
to create more efficient fleets.

21
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,985
And it's clear that the
commercial telematics market

22
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,235
is becoming a cornerstone.

23
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:29,215
Of transportation innovation, you can see
that the global fleet telematics market is

24
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:33,535
projected to reach $214 billion by 2030.

25
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:36,384
That's a massive
transformation opportunity.

26
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,325
Telematics enables measurable value.

27
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:44,275
Predictive maintenance can reduce
maintenance cost by 25%, and

28
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:48,640
intelligent route optimization
can save around 20% in fuel.

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,140
These savings will compound
across thousands of vehicles,

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,590
improving profitability while
also lowering emissions.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,630
In short, cloud telematics isn't just
a technical upgrade, it's a strategic

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,830
business decision that drives both
sustainability and competitiveness.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,639
To understand why this shift
matters, we need to look at how

34
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,175
fleet management has evolved.

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,390
In traditional fleets, everything
was reactive, scheduled maintenance,

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,490
manual inspections, and paper reports.

37
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,215
This meant issues were often discovered
only after breakdowns occurred,

38
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,525
which was costly and inefficient.

39
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,704
Now, cloud-based telematics
flips that model.

40
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,845
Vehicles now transmit real-time
data about performance,

41
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:33,644
location, and driver behavior.

42
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,855
Fleet managers can now monitor
everything remotely, and they

43
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:39,505
can also automate insights.

44
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:43,885
We have gone from reactive management
to predictive intelligence by

45
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:47,965
creating a safer, leaner, and
a more sustainable operation.

46
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:52,085
Now let's look at the technical foundation
that makes all of this possible.

47
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,065
The cloud telematics architecture.

48
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:58,505
Each vehicle becomes a data source
through iot modules that track

49
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,025
performance GPS and environmental data.

50
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,705
This data is protected.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,219
By through multiple
multiple layer security.

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,119
Which is encrypted, authenticated,
and verified from end-to-end.

53
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:16,249
Now, hybrid connectivity, as you can
see, is combining cellular and satellite.

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,259
This ensures that data is transmitted
reliably from anywhere, whether it's

55
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,719
a density or a remote mining site.

56
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,674
Once in the cloud, this data is
processed by scalable analytics.

57
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,889
Engines that apply machine learning
to detect anomalies optimize

58
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,989
operations, and even generate insights.

59
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:38,789
In short, this architecture connects
vehicles, drivers and managers through

60
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,979
a secure, intelligent digital backbone.

61
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,954
Of course, none of this would be effective
without reliable, always on connectivity.

62
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:49,574
Now fleet operations are only as
effective as their connectivity.

63
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:54,014
So in urban environments, cellular
networks provide fast, low

64
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:58,154
latency data transmission for
real time tracking and updates.

65
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:03,644
But fleets, they can operate beyond
coverage zones, rural highways,

66
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:05,294
deserts, or construction sites.

67
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:10,324
That's where the satellite backup
step steps in it's seamless switching

68
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,854
ensures that no vehicle ever goes dark.

69
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:17,324
Intelligent algorithms select the
best network automatically based

70
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,094
on signal, strength and cost.

71
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:23,714
The result is a hybrid communication
layer that guarantees uninterrupted

72
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:28,484
data flow, operational safety, and full
fleet visibility anywhere on the planet.

73
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:33,554
Continuous connectivity enables one of the
biggest breakthroughs in fleet management.

74
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,025
Predictive maintenance.

75
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,095
In a connected fleet, every
component from engines to break

76
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:40,745
becomes a monitored asset.

77
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:45,665
Sensors collect this real-time
performance data while cloud-based AI

78
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:50,645
models learn what normal operation looks
like and flag deviations very early.

79
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,815
Instead of waiting for breakdowns,
we can predict and prevent them.

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,370
This approach reduces emergency payers.

81
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:04,635
Cut maintenance cost by 25%, up to 25%,
let's say, and extends vehicle lifespan.

82
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:10,534
Downtime drops, reliability increases, and
fleet utilization improves dramatically.

83
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:16,145
Predictive maintenance represents a
cultural shift from fixing to foreseen.

84
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:20,435
Once the vehicles are healthy
and connected, the next challenge

85
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,054
is optimizing how they move.

86
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,359
That's where intelligent routing comes.

87
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:28,789
Every route a fleet takes impacts,
cost time, and carbon footprint.

88
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,120
Cloud-based telematics
uses real-time traffic.

89
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:36,629
They look at the weather data and
the load parameters to compute

90
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,099
the most efficient routes.

91
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,369
Automatically, the system adapts to the.

92
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:47,939
Rerouting vehicles around congestion or
storms, balancing loads for efficiency and

93
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:50,489
reducing fuel consumption by up to 20%.

94
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:54,899
This not only saves money, but
also reduces emissions supporting

95
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,539
sustainability, coal, it's dynamic.

96
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:01,189
Data-driven navigation that
thinks ahead, not just reacts.

97
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,839
Driver behavior is another critical
factor in achieving these gains.

98
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,609
It influences safety,
fuel use, and asset life.

99
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:16,729
Telematics tracks driving patterns,
speeding, braking, idling, and uses

100
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,679
this data to provide real time feedback.

101
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,419
The results are striking.

102
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,769
30% fewer harsh driving incidents,
40% improvement in safety scores

103
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,499
and 15% longer vehicle life.

104
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,639
Gamification and coaching
makes it engaging Drivers

105
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,879
get performance dashboards,
recognition, and even incentives.

106
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:41,974
For safe and efficient behavior, it
creates a positive feedback loop between

107
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,984
technology and human performance.

108
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:48,694
Now imagine seeing all of these
insights, vehicle drivers and

109
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,524
performance metrics in one place.

110
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:54,694
The operations dashboard is the
command center for the entire fleet.

111
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:58,864
Managers can see every vehicle's
live location, health status,

112
00:06:58,864 --> 00:06:59,764
and estimated arrival time.

113
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:04,794
Alerts notify teams instantly if
maintenance is due, or if a vehicle

114
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,715
deviates from expected performance.

115
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:11,275
Performance metrics like fuel
consumption, utilization rates, idle

116
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,074
time, they're all tracked automatically.

117
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,155
Automated reporting saves hours
of manual work and provides

118
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:20,994
executives with a clear data-driven
insight for strategic planning.

119
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:23,965
And when organizations
implement this technology.

120
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:29,684
The results are transformative companies
using cloud telematics see measurable

121
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:36,584
results, 15% total cost savings, 20%
better utilization, and significantly

122
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:41,774
reduced emissions, optimized routing,
predictive maintenance, and safer driving.

123
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,979
Directly improve return on investment
while advancing sustainability goals.

124
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:50,179
This is in theory, it's happening
today across logistics, delivery

125
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,349
and public sector fleets.

126
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,849
The more data we collect, the smarter and
cleaner our transportation systems become,

127
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,599
and the next generation of connected
fleets will take this even further.

128
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:04,889
Let's say the future will be defined
by ai, edge computing V two X

129
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:10,009
and digital twins edge computing
processes, data directly in vehicle.

130
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,799
Cutting latency and
improving response times.

131
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:18,169
AI will autonomously make decision
making, continuously learning from

132
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,919
millions of data points V two X,
which is vehicle to everything.

133
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,569
Communication enables safer, more
coordinated traffic flow, and digital

134
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,954
twins will create replicas of entire
fleets, letting us simulate routes.

135
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,174
Maintenance strategies and even energy
usage before implementing them in reality.

136
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,804
So let's recap the key
lessons from this evolution.

137
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,969
Cloud telematics transforms operations.

138
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:47,384
Shifting from reactive management
to predictive intelligence.

139
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:53,114
Hybrid connectivity ensures reliability
fleets stay visible anywhere in the world.

140
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:58,424
Data drives sustainability, route
optimization, and driver insights

141
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:00,344
reduce both costs and emission.

142
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,034
And the future is
intelligent and connected.

143
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:05,134
AI and vehicle to everything.

144
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:08,194
Communication will define the
next chapter in fleet management.

145
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:12,889
These are the four key takeaways
from what we have learned today.

146
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,239
With that, I would like to say thank
you all for joining this session.

147
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,489
Cloud telematics is more than a tool.

148
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:24,424
It's an enabler for smarter, safer,
and more sustainable transportation.

149
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:29,404
By connecting data, people and
technology altogether, we can

150
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:33,244
unlock new levels of efficiency
and environmental responsibility.

151
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:37,084
I look forward to continuing this
conversation and exploring how

152
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,754
we can bring this innovations
to our own fleet operations.

153
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,674
And I'm thoroughly honored to be
speaking at the Comp 42 Prompt

154
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,834
Engineering 2025 conference.

155
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,214
Thank you very much.
