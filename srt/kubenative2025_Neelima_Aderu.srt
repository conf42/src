1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,479
Hey everyone, my name is Jeru.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm currently serving as ASAP
integration Arctic Manager at PWC.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,930
So over past 14 plus years of
experience, I have specialized in AI

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,600
driven integration middleware solutions
and enterprise IT transformations.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,290
Working with global enterprises on
some of the most complex digital

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,850
inter integration challenges.

7
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:30,595
My career journey spans leading AI
power, SAP integration strategies

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:37,745
enabling multi-cloud transformations,
ensuring regulatory CO across GGPR and

9
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,524
H-I-P-A-A and driving cent acquisitions
technology integration for Fortune.

10
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,654
500. Firms.

11
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:50,295
So today I'm excited to share
with you all a case study that

12
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:54,915
demonstrates how Kubernetes need
to AI integration is transforming

13
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:57,085
SAP mergers and, acquisitions.

14
00:00:57,415 --> 00:01:00,655
So if we go to the agenda,
this is what we cover.

15
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:05,565
What we will cover today is the
challenge landscape, the revolutionary

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:10,965
approach, the technical architecture
business impact strategic implications.

17
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:15,745
So by the end, I hope you will
see how AI and Cloud Native Tech.

18
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:19,625
Technologies are fundamentally
reshaping enterprise integration.

19
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:24,885
So the traditional mergers and acquisition
or integration challenge, so mergers

20
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,585
and acquisitions are among the toughest.

21
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:28,645
It challenges.

22
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:36,055
So when two, a large organizations
match their SAP landscapes spanning

23
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:41,185
multiple regions customizations
and data volumes must integrate.

24
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,499
Seamlessly, the traditional approach
brings long timelines, sometimes

25
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:53,899
years massive consulting cost business
disruptions that risk customer experience.

26
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:57,770
So add to that regulatory
complexity, GGPR.

27
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,474
So H-I-P-A-A and, need for
zero downtime and it creates.

28
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:05,415
The perfect strom of complexity.

29
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:07,425
So these are all the, challenges.

30
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:12,725
And if we go into the complex
the integration landscape, let's

31
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,315
break this down further, right?

32
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:17,445
So the technicality complex so multiple.

33
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:23,424
Multi different layers of systems
like legacy, SCP, some databases,

34
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:27,864
and then legacy migrations and
the data volumes in terabyte.

35
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,484
So these are all the technical complex.

36
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:34,525
Cities we face on daily basis and
regulatory complex, requirements like

37
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:39,005
global compliance frameworks and then
business continuity, like keeping

38
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,255
the lights on with no disruption.

39
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:47,825
So this is why traditional integration
models often fail to deliver efficiently.

40
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:53,714
So if we take about the revolutionary
approach Kubernetes native ai.

41
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:55,554
Integration.

42
00:02:55,954 --> 00:03:01,354
Instead of treating integration as a
slow manual process, we reimagined it as

43
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,084
a cloud native workload powered by ai.

44
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,814
We used Kubernetes
orchestration for scalability.

45
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:13,059
Containerized AI modules like the
flexibility in deployment, mission

46
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,039
learning automation for mapping
analysis and migration continuous

47
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,199
learning models that improve over time.

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,089
So this distributor intelligence
means AI could handle multiple

49
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:31,519
integration tasks in parallel
cutting time and effort dramatically.

50
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,989
So how it works, right?

51
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,999
So in, in theory, we know I have
explained like these many things

52
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:45,119
like ation the modules, mission
learning, continuous learning modules,

53
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,799
and the distribution intelligence.

54
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,209
But in this is the theory, but in
practice, you know how it works, right?

55
00:03:53,209 --> 00:04:00,059
So AI models deployed as a micro, if
you see the picture here it act, it

56
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:06,239
deploys as a microservices in congen,
each specializing in mapping data

57
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,864
validation a code analysis, and then
transformer networks identified a

58
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:15,994
complex master data patterns and CNNs.

59
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,544
Analyzed AAP code for business logic.

60
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:25,839
Graph neural networks optimized
SAP dependencies, also Kubernetes

61
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,279
orchestration, ensure fault, autoscaling,
and high performance because the system

62
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,589
process for 500, a hundred thousand
records per second across 10 terabyte

63
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,319
data sets a scale traditional approach.

64
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:40,794
Couldn't match it all.

65
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:46,314
So that is the, technical architecture
we have in in, in, in a practice.

66
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,014
And then what is the timeline?

67
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:52,734
The accelerated timeline, if
we follow this, the impact was

68
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:57,539
like transformational, like the
timelines reduced by 50 to 70%.

69
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:00,939
What once took like 12 to 18 months.

70
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,599
Now we took four to six per six months.

71
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:09,419
Also the processing speed if
half a million record per second.

72
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,189
Also, the automation eliminated
manual mapping, like reducing

73
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,959
human errors and cost.

74
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:20,914
Parallel processing ensure
rapid rapid conflict resolution

75
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:22,594
and continuous operations.

76
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:26,934
He some of the live examples of,
the recent examples, what we have

77
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:32,745
had here, we have had like terabytes
of data migration, so master data.

78
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:40,344
When it comes to master data, many of we
migrate materials, vendors, customers.

79
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:46,605
Vendor banks, profit center, cost
center, the PTM related, like

80
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,735
the batch traceability metrics.

81
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:52,975
Bill of ma, bill of mapping and
the routing, the employee id.

82
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:58,045
So many master data objects we have
to migrate during the master data load

83
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,770
period where, it has it terabytes of data.

84
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,490
So I know or we all know business
usually provides the data to the

85
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:14,140
consultants, but what if the data
quality is not up to the mark?

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,180
So we it's very simple to say, Hey,
that is the data you have given.

87
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,950
So that is how we load it.

88
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,750
But instead out of the box, we.

89
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:29,325
Utilize these AI modules, these
mission learn, learning tools that

90
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,424
will check the data quality as well.

91
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:37,484
So from each functional consultant,
we have taken the prerequisites

92
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,145
of, the checks, what we need to do.

93
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:41,495
For example, vendor master.

94
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:43,595
These columns are mandatory.

95
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:47,615
Or maybe the delivery date should
be, between these time zones.

96
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,905
It shouldn't be the past two.

97
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,290
It's a very minor example, but.

98
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:55,905
It would make a lot of sense if you
get all the world data, if you work,

99
00:06:55,905 --> 00:07:02,235
if you go through this workflow, you
would get the errors on spot in instead

100
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,925
of waiting for longer period after
go live and impact the operations.

101
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:10,115
So that is how we have created a
workflow based on the inputs that we have

102
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:12,455
received from functional and business.

103
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,005
So we will cover that in future also.

104
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,465
So here the key is business.

105
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:20,195
IT collaboration is a key for any.

106
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,085
Successful project.

107
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:25,235
So with all the inputs we
have created a workflow.

108
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,005
We have checked the data quality.

109
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,834
So it's called like preload sign off.

110
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:35,745
So before loading the data, we got
the preload sign off from these

111
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:40,289
AI tools and using the mission
linear technologies and then.

112
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:46,015
We started loading the data, which
resulted, a hundred percent data quality.

113
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:50,765
Also when it comes to critical operational
transactional data, yes, you need

114
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,960
open sales order, open patch order.

115
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,725
When you are dealing with the ERP
customers you need the customer number.

116
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:02,875
Shipped tools, all those details
we load as part of the critical

117
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,825
operational transactional data with these
checks, again, using the AI modules.

118
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:11,455
And when it comes to financial
transactional data loads, of

119
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:16,164
course you have to load AP, ar,
fixed assets, gl, non GL balances.

120
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,860
Stuff and you had to
match the trial balance.

121
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,100
So that is a key in any of
the digital transformation.

122
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,450
So we have used these a, AI tools
the, using the SAP integration and

123
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:35,100
Kubernetes, to help functional and
business it people, to speed up and, to

124
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,309
have a smooth digital transformation.

125
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,350
So he, this is his like, smallest
example, like how we accelerated the

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,190
integration timeline and then how it
impacted the cost and efficiency, right?

127
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:58,599
So beyond speed, the AI automation, it it
up, it deliver like massive cost benefits.

128
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,010
For example, 78% reduction
in integration cost.

129
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,699
85% reduction in manual effort
replacing armies of consultants,

130
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,319
and 92% reduction in rework cycles.

131
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,949
Thanks to AI driven quality
validations, like I mentioned,

132
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:17,324
the tools that we have used.

133
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,244
So this was not just faster, it was
smarter, linear, and more reliable.

134
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:29,180
So this is how we have optimized the
cost and also increased the efficiency.

135
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,949
And then AI driven data
mapping and transformation.

136
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:33,454
So the AI.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,189
Could recognize data patterns and
automatically suggest mapping and generate

138
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:45,319
transformation logic for conversions,
integrity checks and business rules.

139
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,360
It provides continuous validation,
correcting errors in real time.

140
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,775
Also it predicts potential risk and even
resolve certain issues automatically.

141
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:04,555
So in fact, 93% of potential issues were
caught before impacting the operations.

142
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:08,215
A huge leap from traditional
reactive approaches.

143
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:12,355
So what are all the strategic
implications, of these?

144
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:16,495
Using these ai kuber net SAP
integration tools, right?

145
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:20,035
So this is not just about one project.

146
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:26,065
It's about rethinking mergers and
acquisition integrations entirely.

147
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,490
So integration becomes innovation,
a source of competitive advantage.

148
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,830
A company's gain reusable AI
framework for ongoing transformations.

149
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,600
Also, employees can move faster with
greater acquisition flexibility.

150
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,930
So in essence, AI transforms integration
from a cost center into a growth

151
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:55,900
enabler, so as we look forward,
companies must invest in data quality

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,230
and governance build internal,
enterprise in ai, especially in,

153
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,850
we have, we all know that there are
so many cloud native technologies.

154
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,790
So they, there should be
a dedicated in general.

155
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,635
Ize in AI and cloud native technology.

156
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:22,125
We are, the technologies keep on changing,
likewise, we have to brush up our, coming,

157
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:26,105
these new technologies and get up to this.

158
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,160
Speed with the as, as we are growing,
as we are changing and make sure

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,550
we have we usually, build internal
expertise in ai, cloud Native Tech.

160
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,040
So not just by tools, right?

161
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,945
So the team should be up.

162
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,080
Speed to match with the technology
that is rapidly changing.

163
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,970
Also, like I mentioned before we
encourage business IT collaboration

164
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,960
since AI needs real business.

165
00:11:55,485 --> 00:12:00,795
Context as a it yes, you know
about your tool, how the technology

166
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:09,245
is changing how the ai, is can
definitely helpful to to succeed.

167
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:09,735
Yeah.

168
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,260
Or to avoid certain issues, right?

169
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:16,825
So as a it, but what issues
you need to concentrate.

170
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:20,025
Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4 out of four.

171
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:23,355
What is P one out of four P ones, right?

172
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:29,325
So those important details and all the
knowledge has to come from business.

173
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,980
Hey, this is what we have.

174
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,400
During this digital transformation, these
are the complex requirements I have where

175
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:47,220
I need these as a first phase, and maybe
out of these three, these two are very

176
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:54,345
business critical where we need to see
how ai, this Cuban and SAP integration.

177
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,305
Can be useful.

178
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:59,975
So it's all business IT collaboration.

179
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:06,625
Since AI needs a real business context and
then approach integration as a long-term

180
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,845
capability, not a one-off project.

181
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:14,755
So when you as a integration consultant
or as integration architect, when

182
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:18,805
you develop any of the logic for
one of the requirements, so you

183
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:21,325
need to think big out of the box.

184
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,115
Okay.

185
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:26,050
For simple example,
okay, so this is a EDI.

186
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:31,655
PO mapping where we need to
map one field to another field.

187
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,425
And this is the logic I have.

188
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,355
What if.

189
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,195
Another customer comes, is
this mapping sufficient?

190
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,855
Or maybe I need to, develop the mapping
a new way that it would be accommodate

191
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,985
or easily maintainable when new customer
comes in, utilize the similar mapping.

192
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:57,685
So that is how the approach integration
as a long term capability, not just

193
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,515
for one of the project, so those.

194
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,230
Who do this will be a best
position to lead the next wave

195
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,150
of this digital transformation.

196
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,730
So thank you for your time.

197
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,370
I hope this session showed you how AI
forward Cunet native SAP integration

198
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,265
is changing the game for enterprises
during mergers and acquisitions.

199
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,385
Then I would be very happy
to take your questions.

200
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,075
Thank you.
