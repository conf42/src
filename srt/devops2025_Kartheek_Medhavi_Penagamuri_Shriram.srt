00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,040
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:01,940
Happy New Year.

3
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Karthik Medhavi,
Penangamuri, Sri Ram.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,850
In this presentation, we will explore
how artificial intelligence has become a

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,179
powerful force in software development,
helping developers complete their

6
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,769
tasks more quickly with fewer errors.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,350
Tools like AI coding assistants can
automatically suggest code snippets, spot

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,850
potential mistakes, and provide insights
that reduce the amount of time spent

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,970
on repetitive or mundane activities.

10
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:34,625
This allows developers to focus
on creative problem solving,

11
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:38,485
designing better architectures,
and innovating new features.

12
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:42,985
What's exciting is that these AI
driven tools don't replace developers.

13
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:45,645
Instead, they serve as
collaborative partners.

14
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:50,095
By handling tedious tasks, AI
frees up human talent to spend

15
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,794
more time thinking about overall
project goals and the user needs.

16
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:55,575
Throughout this presentation.

17
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:59,705
We will discuss how AI is currently
used to improve software development

18
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:03,565
and how these tools might shape up
the roles of developers in the future.

19
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:09,325
Our main message AI can supercharge
productivity and creativity, but

20
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:13,775
human expertise remains at the heart
of any successful software project.

21
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:19,520
Today, AI coding assistants like GitHub
co pilot have already become part of many.

22
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,605
Software Development Teams Toolkits.

23
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:26,765
These assistants can analyze code as you
type and offer suggestions in real time,

24
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:29,335
which helps developers write better code.

25
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:34,295
For instance, they can propose
function outlines, variable names,

26
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,584
or entire algorithms, all based
on the context of the project.

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,860
Many enterprises find this incredibly
useful because it can help cut

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,170
down on coding errors and make it
easier to maintain large codebases.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,310
Another significant benefit is reduced
cognitive load on developers, meaning

30
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,620
they don't have to consistently
keep every detail in mind.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,120
AI coding assistants can help with
documentation and testing, reducing

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,405
technical debt, automatically
suggesting improvements, or

33
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,315
clarifying tricky areas of the code.

34
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:14,335
By giving teams a reliable second opinion,
AI can lower the chances of bugs slipping

35
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:18,964
through and encourage developers to focus
on higher level architectural decisions.

36
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:24,935
Overall, AI driven tools are taking over
many repetitive tasks and increasing

37
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:28,855
efficiency across various stages
of software development lifecycle.

38
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:35,515
Package management systems such as NPM,
Yarn, Maven, or NuGet are the backbone

39
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:39,795
of modern software development projects,
helping developers quickly add external

40
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,935
libraries and manage code dependencies.

41
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:46,865
Integrating AI with these systems can
make resolving complex version conflicts

42
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:49,505
or dependency chains far easier.

43
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:52,605
And AI can also suggest
code snippets based upon the

44
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,975
current package dependencies.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,850
Instead of combining through conflicting
library requirements or worrying about

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,810
which versions work best together, AI can
automatically handle much of this work,

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,720
suggesting compatible combinations and
alerting teams to any potential issues.

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,930
Security is another big advantage.

49
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,830
Malicious packages or
vulnerabilities can sneak into a

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,380
project if teams are not careful.

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,710
AI assisted package managers can
perform automatic vulnerability

52
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,570
scans, track signed packages, and
even warn developers if they are

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,210
about to import a risky library.

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,820
This ensures that the project
stays secure while also reducing

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,020
the burden on developers.

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,800
Best of all, AI understands.

57
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:43,175
Your exact project setup, the current
package dependencies, and it can provide

58
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:48,045
highly relevant suggestions for future
dependency updates and how to, and how

59
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:53,405
to use the existing packages efficiently,
thereby saving time and minimizing errors.

60
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:58,095
Looking ahead, AI's role in
quality assurance and testing

61
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,735
is set to expand dramatically.

62
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,835
Tools are emerging that can generate
test cases automatically, especially

63
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,805
for edge, edge case scenarios.

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,970
that developers might
not think of right away.

65
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,620
This speeds up bug detection and
helps create more robust applications.

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,380
Additionally, AI is becoming smarter
about analyzing historical build data,

67
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,730
making it possible to pinpoint the
best times for deploying new features

68
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,800
or rolling back potentially harmful
changes before they affect users.

69
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,970
On the predictive analytics side,
AI can provide project managers

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,644
with more accurate estimates of how
long tasks might take to complete.

71
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:39,235
where bottlenecks may occur
and even recommend ways to

72
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,545
resolve these bottlenecks.

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,590
Over time, this continuous learning
process can dramatically reduce surprises

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,140
and allow for more efficient planning.

75
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:56,100
As these AI driven testing and analytics
and analysis tools become more refined,

76
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,380
expect to see a robust boost in developer
confidence and the speed at which the

77
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,150
features are delivered to the end users.

78
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,190
Modern software development often
embraces a DevOps culture, which brings

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,030
Development and operations together to
simplify processes and speed up releases.

80
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,690
AI tools can align naturally with
this approach by taking over routine

81
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,030
or repetitive tasks, automating code
deployments, and continuously monitoring

82
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,820
applications for any signs of trouble.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,790
This monitoring can include tracking
server performance, watching for unusual

84
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,670
user behaviors, or spotting suspicious
logs that might indicate a security risk.

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,240
Moreover, AI supports infrastructure as
code by helping general or generating

86
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,550
configuration files and scripts.

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,110
In many cases, developers can simply
specify their requirements and AI will

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,490
handle much of the configuration details.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,805
This reduces the chance of human error and
encourages faster more reliable updates.

90
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:07,945
By letting AI handle these behind
the scenes tasks, developers gain

91
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:12,655
more time to innovate, collaborate,
and ensure their applications are

92
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,365
truly meeting the user's needs.

93
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:19,935
To get most out of the AI
tools, developers need a basic

94
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,685
understanding of how AI models work.

95
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,825
This does not mean every developer
must be a data scientist, but a

96
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:32,735
grasp of neural networks, model
training, and data requirements.

97
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,190
can make it easier to choose
and fine tune AI tools.

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,940
With a bit of knowledge, teams can
configure AI suggestions to suit

99
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,240
their coding style, handle specialized
use cases, and maintain higher

100
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
accuracy in production environments.

101
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,110
Many companies have found success by
running workshops or short training

102
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,360
sessions that show developers how to
use AI tools in their day to day tasks.

103
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,780
These sessions can help people feel
comfortable experimenting with AI

104
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,680
driven features, identifying the
best scenarios for using them,

105
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,000
and avoiding common pitfalls.

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,950
With the right foundation, developers
can become more confident in prompting,

107
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,630
evaluating, and iterating on AI outputs,
leading to faster development cycles

108
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,340
and higher quality applications.

109
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,270
One reason AI can understand code is
through a concept called embeddings.

110
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,030
Essentially, an embedding
translates line of code into numeric

111
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,790
representations that capture the
meaning and structure of the code.

112
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,505
By using these representations,
AI tools can compare snippets

113
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:51,895
of code more effectively than
traditional keyword based searches.

114
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:57,184
For large code bases, this means
being able to quickly locate

115
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:01,274
relevant sections or discover
similar functions that can be reused.

116
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:07,609
In practice, This can help developers
navigate a maze of files without having

117
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,749
to remember every detail in the project.

118
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:16,399
Instead of searching manually or trying
to recall where a certain function lives,

119
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:22,239
an embedding based tool can show you
all the places where similar patterns

120
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,999
were implemented in the code base.

121
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,239
This makes knowledge sharing
within the teams more seamless.

122
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:36,429
promotes code consistency and reduces
the chance of duplicate or inconsistent

123
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,359
implementations lurking in your project.

124
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:45,529
Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG,
takes AI code generation to a higher

125
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,759
level by giving the model or the large
language model access to your team

126
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,579
specific data like documentation.

127
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,719
codebase history and style guidelines.

128
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,929
This means that the AI can adapt
its suggestions to fit your

129
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:06,669
project's unique naming conventions,
coding patterns, architecture

130
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,639
patterns, or even coding standards.

131
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:13,694
Essentially, it is no longer
just generic AI advice.

132
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:17,274
It is personalized for your team's needs.

133
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:21,574
From scaffolding new modules
to refactoring legacy systems,

134
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:28,194
Rackpower tools offer end to end
support across projects lifespan.

135
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:32,654
They can automatically
recommend test cases or propose

136
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,724
architectural improvements.

137
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,449
All informed by previously approved
coding patterns in your code base.

138
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:46,379
This not only speeds up development,
but also ensures long term

139
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:53,099
maintainability because the AI respects
and reinforces consistent coding

140
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,409
practices in the entire code base.

141
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:00,309
Getting top results from AI tools
often comes down to the prompt

142
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,489
engineering, which involves learning
how to ask the AI the right questions

143
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,574
Or give it the right instructions.

144
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:14,284
If your prompts are too broad, you
might get vague or irrelevant coding

145
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,374
suggestions in another, in another words.

146
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:19,714
Model might hallucinate the responses.

147
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:25,384
However, if you are specific by
detailing your project context, desired

148
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:31,694
outcomes or coding style, AI can often
provide near production ready code.

149
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:38,204
Developers who refine prompts and
actively iterate on them can drastically

150
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,984
improve the usefulness of AI outputs.

151
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:48,124
Beyond prompt engineering, fully using
advanced features in AI tools is crucial.

152
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:55,165
For instance, some coding assistants
can audit your code base for performance

153
00:10:55,195 --> 00:11:00,264
bottlenecks, or look at how different
modules interact to spot potential errors.

154
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:06,040
By combining these features with
continuous feedback loops, Teams

155
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,940
often find they can reduce technical
debt, detect performance issues

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,010
early, and maintain a healthier
code base over the long run.

157
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,189
When approached strategically, AI tools
become a growth engine for a project

158
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,849
boosting both speed and quality.

159
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:29,559
As AI continues to refine and optimize
software development, teams can

160
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,079
deliver features to market much faster.

161
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,639
Some see up to 60 percent gains in speed.

162
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,769
This does not just benefit tech companies.

163
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,239
It can also drive advances in
healthcare, education, transportation,

164
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:50,819
and, and many industries by allowing
quicker experimentation and faster

165
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,119
iteration on crucial solutions.

166
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,499
The ripple effects of these
advancements can shape our daily lives.

167
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,709
And open doors to
cutting edge innovations.

168
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,119
Still, the societal impact of
widespread AI use cannot be ignored.

169
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:13,189
Questions about job displacement, data
privacy, and the potential for bias in

170
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,909
AI systems are more pressing than ever.

171
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:23,514
That's why it's essential to balance
rapid innovation with ethical safeguards

172
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:29,154
like ensuring AI recommendations are
transparent, tested for fairness, and

173
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:31,344
regularly audited for potential harm.

174
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,934
The future is bright, but it's
up to the developers and the

175
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:41,574
organizations to use AI responsibly
for the greatest collective benefit.

176
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:46,044
Ethics in AI is not just
about following rules.

177
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:49,604
It's about being proactive in
preventing harmful outcomes.

178
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,834
One key concern is bias.

179
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:57,874
which can creep into AI when the training
data is not diverse or representative.

180
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:04,724
For coding assistants, bias might
manifest as excluding certain

181
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:08,774
coding patterns or favoring specific
frameworks without a reason.

182
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:15,244
Teams should run periodic audits
or tests that check how AI behaves

183
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:19,834
with various input styles to
ensure fairness and inclusivity.

184
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,524
Transparency is equally vital.

185
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:28,844
By keeping clear documentation of model
training data, version history, and

186
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:34,744
any decisions AI tools make, you make
it easier to trace and explain how

187
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:36,744
certain features end up in your code.

188
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:44,265
Having AI ethics communities or dedicated
review boards can help teams spot

189
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:46,315
and address ethical challenges early.

190
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:51,955
With these structures in place, AI
assisted development can stay aligned

191
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:56,295
with company values, community
guidelines, and broader societal needs.

192
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:01,675
As AI reshapes coding workflows,
Developers need to evolve

193
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,245
their skill sets to keep up.

194
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:08,075
Traditionally programmers
might spend hours debugging

195
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,985
or writing boilerplate code.

196
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:17,445
Now AI can handle many of these tasks,
which means developers can focus more

197
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:22,925
on architectural decision Creating
solutions and interdisciplinary community

198
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:28,455
collaboration with other product teams,
data scientists, or even other AI systems.

199
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:33,675
This shift emphasizes critical
thinking over road coding.

200
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:40,615
However, learning to use AI effectively
is not just about adopting new

201
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,305
tools, it's about the mindset.

202
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:48,315
Developers who understand the
limitations of AI, how it is trained,

203
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:54,135
and when to trust or question its
suggestions tend to harness the

204
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,415
new coding tools more successfully.

205
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:01,115
They become more agile, quickly
testing new ideas, and refining

206
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:02,815
them based on the AI feedback.

207
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,305
Continuous learning is the key.

208
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:10,775
Staying updated on the latest AI
features and best practices ensures

209
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:16,210
developers Maintain an edge in the
fast moving industry to wrap up.

210
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:22,820
We have seen how AI is transforming every
phase of software development from coding

211
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,460
and testing to deployment and maintenance
by automating repetitive tasks.

212
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,620
And providing data driven insights,
AI helps developers deliver

213
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,990
faster and more robust solutions.

214
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,600
However, the human factor remains
essential for creativity, ethical

215
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,700
oversight, and high level decision making.

216
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,050
Embracing this new paradigm means
partnering with AI rather than

217
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,220
treating it as a magical solution.

218
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,270
Teams that invest in understanding
how AI tools work, keep their data,

219
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,450
Pipelines or CICD pipelines clean and
maintain strong ethical standards will

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,180
be well positioned to try to thrive.

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,340
In the end, a balanced human AI
collaboration fosters innovation,

222
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,109
