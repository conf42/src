00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,580
Harnessing AI for Algorithmic Trading.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,609
Hi everyone, I'm Sunny Guntuka,
Senior Data Analyst at Guideline.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,320
ai and today we are diving into
something truly game changing,

4
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:16,330
the impact of Artificial
Intelligence on Algorithmic Trading.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,500
Now, let me ask you, what if an AI
model could analyze thousands of

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,350
data points, predict market trends,
and execute trades faster and more

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,369
accurately than any human trader?

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,220
Sounds futuristic.

9
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:36,179
it's already happening, and today
we will explore exactly how AI

10
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,729
is reshaping financial markets.

11
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,809
AI in trading is not just a buzzword.

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,269
It's a revolution.

13
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:51,259
Processes, it processes massive amounts
of market data, detects trading patterns,

14
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:58,829
human currency, executes high speed, high
precision trades, and it's proven to work.

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:05,524
AI driven strategies improve risk
adjusted returns by up to 25%.

16
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:10,094
That's a massive competitive
edge in today's volatile markets.

17
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:11,954
Reinforcement learning.

18
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:16,884
One of the most powerful AI techniques
in trading is reinforcement learning.

19
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:21,274
So what actually is
reinforcement learning?

20
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:27,144
It's a type of AI that learns through
experience and it tests different

21
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,894
trading strategies, learns from
mistakes, and continuously improves.

22
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:33,574
Why does this matter?

23
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:37,804
Traditional models struggle
when market conditions shift.

24
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:43,644
Reinforcement learning adapts in
real time, constantly adjusting

25
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,804
its strategy to maximize returns.

26
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:52,925
For example, imagine an AI trading bot
that learns from past trades, adapts

27
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:59,674
to market shifts, And optimizes risk
management all without human intervention.

28
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:02,764
That's the power of
reinforcement learning.

29
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:05,254
And next coming to the deep learning.

30
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:10,494
Now let's talk about, deep
learning, especially long term,

31
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,425
long short term memory networks.

32
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,275
Why are LSTMs powerful?

33
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:21,885
They detect hidden market
trends in historical price data.

34
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:27,105
They capture long term dependencies
that traditional models miss.

35
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:32,865
They improve predictive accuracy by
15 percent over standard techniques.

36
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:38,035
LSTMs help traders anticipate
market movements with greater

37
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:42,245
precision, which can make a big
difference in high frequency trade.

38
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,325
I'm coming to the sentiment analysis.

39
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,935
Markets don't just run on
numbers, they run on emotion.

40
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:58,115
AI driven sentiment analysis scans news,
earnings, reports, and social media to

41
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,975
gauge market sentiment in real time.

42
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,834
So why does this matter?

43
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:07,404
Because investor psychology
drives stocks prices.

44
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,295
Traders who incorporate sentiment
analysis have seen a 10 percent

45
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:17,354
increase in intraday performance,
especially in small cap stocks

46
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:20,494
where news can move prices quickly.

47
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,264
And

48
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:29,294
coming to the challenges, but of course,
AI trading isn't without challenges

49
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:32,184
and there are some major hurdles.

50
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,454
First one is data overload.

51
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:40,564
Too much data can overwhelm the models
and which lead to hallucination.

52
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,474
Bias in AI models.

53
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:50,264
If historical data is biased,
AI decisions can be and the next

54
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,054
one is regulatory compliance.

55
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:58,904
So government, implement several
financial AIs must meet strict legal

56
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:02,114
standards and transparency issues.

57
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:08,204
Many AI models are black boxes, which
traders can't always explain why

58
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,964
these particular decisions were made.

59
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:16,444
These challenges highlight why
AI in trading must be implemented

60
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,884
ethically and responsibly.

61
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:22,214
Coming to emerging technologies
and the future of AI trading.

62
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,754
The first one is quantum computing.

63
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:30,184
Quantum AI can process financial
models 100 million times faster

64
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,534
than today's supercomputers.

65
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:35,544
It will revolutionize
portfolio optimization, fraud

66
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,944
detection, and risk assessment.

67
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,214
And the next one is federated learning.

68
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:46,414
AI models will train without data
ever leaving financial institutions.

69
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:51,514
This means Better privacy,
stronger security, and collective

70
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,924
intelligence in trading.

71
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:58,834
These technologies will push AI
trading into an entirely new frontier.

72
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:04,794
For AI driven trading to be effective,
we need the right infrastructure.

73
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:10,094
High performance computing, AI
models need ultra fast servers.

74
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:13,434
And the next one is low latency execution.

75
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:16,844
Trades must be executed in milliseconds.

76
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:23,014
Nowadays, there are like, I'll go
algorithms that execute trades by

77
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:27,764
tick by analyzing, order by order.

78
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:30,574
And the next one is regulatory complaints.

79
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:34,694
Financial AI must follow legal frameworks.

80
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:38,564
The phones that invest in
this infrastructure will lead

81
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,744
the AI trading revolution.

82
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:44,494
I'm coming to the future
of a developers in finance.

83
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:49,194
So what does this mean for a developers
in the financial industry coming

84
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:54,534
to financial acumen, understanding
market dynamics, risk management

85
00:05:54,874 --> 00:06:01,634
and regulations is just as important
as coding and AI and ML expertise.

86
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:06,089
Developers need deep knowledge
of reinforcement learning, deep

87
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,379
learning, and model optimization.

88
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,109
Coming to ethical AI development, ensuring
transparency, fairness, and security in

89
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,219
AI driven trading solutions is critical.

90
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:24,227
The future belongs to those who can merge
AI expertise with financial strategy.

91
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:24,669
AI

92
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,429
is not just the future of trading.

93
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,059
it's happening right now.

94
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:34,894
Traders, investors, developers,
this is your moment.

95
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,784
AI is transforming financial markets.

96
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:42,234
Will you embrace it or be left behind?

97
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,424
And thank you for your time.

98
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:48,034
And let's embrace the future
of AI trading together.

99
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,238
Thanks.
