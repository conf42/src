00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,070
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,360
Thanks for tuning into Con
42 Machine Learning 2025.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,189
My name is Mohan.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,270
I'm a data and AI expert with over
12 years of experience in this field.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,490
Today I'm super excited to talk
about from insights to Impact, how

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,650
can companies revolutionize customer
experience using AI and data analytics.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,010
So without any further
ado, let's get started.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,470
Here is a quick agenda for today.

9
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:32,805
First, we'll start off with
understanding what is the current

10
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,335
state of customer experience.

11
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:38,205
Then we'll spend some time
understanding what are some of

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,405
the key challenges in current CX
strategies employed by companies.

13
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,394
Then we'll touch upon what is
the role of data and AI driven

14
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,225
strategies in customer experience.

15
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:53,955
Then we'll explore how companies can drive
customer experience transformation using

16
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:56,955
ai, and at the end, we'll conclude with.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,920
How can companies prepare for
customer experience transformation

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,660
using artificial intelligence?

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,620
Before we dive into the specifics,
let's first understand why

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,480
transform customer experience.

21
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:18,840
If we think about it, we are living
in a world where customer expectations

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,000
have evolved dramatically over
time, and now they expect more

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,220
personalized experiences across.

24
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:31,315
All the touch points they have with
a given product or s service and

25
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:36,744
companies that deliver on this promise
of hyper personalized experience, they

26
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:41,725
tend to outperform its competitors,
both in terms of customer growth

27
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:43,645
as well as customer retention.

28
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:49,104
In addition to that, there is a
massive data opportunity as well.

29
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,764
In the last decade or so, companies.

30
00:01:53,435 --> 00:02:01,535
Started to amass huge amounts of customer
data, but lot of companies struggle to

31
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:06,305
tap into this data to generate value
and better experience for its customers.

32
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:12,995
And now with recent advancements in AI
and machine learning companies have even

33
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:18,345
better ways to take advantage of this data
and ultimately deliver superior customer

34
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,775
experience to, to their customers.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Now let's understand what is the
current state of customer experience?

36
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,859
As I said in the earlier slide in the
last decade or so, there is this huge

37
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:38,720
data explosion wherein companies started
to collect huge amounts of data about

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,310
its customers, about be it, be there.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,970
Product usage, their transactions,
their behaviors within the website

40
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,950
or app, or their engagement with
the social media channels or the

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,570
customer service interactions.

42
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:59,140
The problem is a lot of companies
struggle to turn this data into meaningful

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,080
insights that ultimately improve customer
experience and lead to improvements in

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,450
customer engagement and satisfaction.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,840
There are a lot of reasons for that.

46
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,010
And few challenges that I have noticed
in my experience are oftentimes the

47
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,770
data is fragmented, meaning they live
in siloed systems, which limits the

48
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,320
ability to comp for companies to have
a single unified view of a customer.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,480
Also, companies tend to employ more
reactive strategies than proactive.

50
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:42,705
In terms of figuring out customer issues
or anticipating customer needs because

51
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:48,665
of this pro like these disconnected
systems, data systems, it limits the

52
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:54,310
ability to, for companies to personalize
a customer experience and that ultimately

53
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,670
lead to dissatisfaction among customers.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,965
Also, certain few companies are very
hesitant to adapt to new technologies.

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,580
And that causes serious damage in the
long run in for the, for those companies.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,580
So if we were to take a more deeper
look into what are some of the key

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,399
challenges in currency CX strategies?

58
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,570
As I said in the previous slide,
the bigger challenge that I have

59
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,770
noticed is siloed data systems.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,960
Yes, companies collect huge
amounts of data that can be used

61
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,610
to improve customer experience.

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,075
But because the data is not so connected
well and live in live in a siloed,

63
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:44,844
disconnected manner, it becomes very
difficult for companies to take advantage

64
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:49,764
of this data and translate this into
meaningful and actionable insights.

65
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:53,614
So what happens is because of this.

66
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:58,644
It leads to it leads to a, it leads
to a place where companies cannot

67
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:02,434
truly understand like what is the
360 degree view of a customer?

68
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:05,584
What are the transactions or
behaviors exhibited by customers?

69
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:10,024
And that limits their ability
to personalize their experience.

70
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,364
So the root of all ultimately it leads
to poor personalization, but the main

71
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:17,494
thing that companies needs to solve.

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,580
Is solving for these siloed systems
and integrating all this data in

73
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,169
a manner that generates meaningful
insights to improve customer experience.

74
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,140
And that is what now we
are going to explore.

75
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:35,510
So how can companies solve for these
challenges and drive improvements

76
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,010
to their customer experience?

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,150
This is where the data driven
CX strategy comes into play.

78
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,689
So the very first step that
companies needs to do is.

79
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,869
They need to start off with data
integration, meaning rather than having

80
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:56,210
siloed, disconnected systems, they
need to think about a, think about

81
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,619
integrating all this data, consolidating
all this data from different touch

82
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:04,789
points, different systems into one
single place so that they can have

83
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,699
the true, that true holistic, unified
view of a customer so that it leads to

84
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,099
better understanding of their customers.

85
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:19,509
And once the data is in data is integrated
and they have and they have access to

86
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,509
this data, then companies needs to think
about how to translate this data into

87
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,819
actionable and meaningful insights.

88
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,059
Because without any insights coming out
of data, it becomes really tricky and

89
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:38,659
challenging for companies to act on or
act on it and improve customer experience.

90
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,889
So the second step is.

91
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:44,224
How companies needs to understand
how to translate this data

92
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,755
into actionable insights.

93
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:50,505
So it involves, looking at what are the
different patterns or like different

94
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:55,414
behaviors exhibited by customers like
using this for more advanced predict

95
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,964
to analytics and all that stuff,
which we'll get into in later slides.

96
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:03,034
But they need to figure out a way to
translate this wealth of data into more

97
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,374
meaningful and actionable insights and.

98
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:10,819
Once they have a good understanding
in terms of their customer, the next

99
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,949
step is how can they incorporate AI
and machine learning to basically

100
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,339
automate the experience the customer
experience for its customers.

101
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,699
So this is where, adopting technologies
like ai, machine learning comes into

102
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,469
picture, which will lead to, not only
personalizing customer experience, but

103
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,960
improvements in engagement, improvements
in customer satisfaction, and.

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,409
The most important thing is this
has to be a continuous loop.

105
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,680
It's not like companies do it
once and just be done with it.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,229
They have to continuously refine
this process, figure out if there

107
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,559
are any gaps or issues, and figure
out ways to solve for these things.

108
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,929
And that is only possible, like once
they start measuring what are the

109
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:56,639
outcomes from this, like from this
system, from this framework where data is

110
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,249
integrated, insights are being generated.

111
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,259
Machine learning, ai, ML
solutions are deployed.

112
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,334
And what are the outcomes of it?

113
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:07,724
What are like, what are the areas
where they're still falling short of

114
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:11,684
customer expectations and go there
and start to improve those process.

115
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:17,025
So I think employing this data driven
framework really helps companies to

116
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:21,914
not just personalize experiences,
but also do achieve much more things

117
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,924
rather than just personalization.

118
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,919
Now let's try to understand these
things in a more detailed manner.

119
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,219
So let's start off with data integration.

120
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:39,250
So when I say data integration,
what I mean by that is, as I said

121
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,439
earlier, companies collect data about
customers through various systems.

122
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,319
In my experience, I have seen
companies tracking behavioral data.

123
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,010
Like what?

124
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,120
Clicks or like what, I mean what
buttons or like what features

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,910
have been used by customers within
the website or within the app?

126
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,510
So they do capture this data
through systems like Adobe

127
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,160
Analytics or like Google Analytics.

128
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
They do track this information.

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,160
They also collect customer
feedback and sentiment data.

130
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,250
This is where they talk about,
reviews or support interactions

131
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,080
or social media mentions.

132
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,550
They also collect profile
data that is with.

133
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,955
It, they have information on
demographics of a customer, their

134
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:23,545
preferences, their segment, whatnot,
and they also collect like contextual

135
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:25,375
data, such as like location, device.

136
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:29,735
But overall, most importantly,
they track the transactional data.

137
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,955
That is very important because the
end of the day customers are coming to

138
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:37,095
your website or your app and ultimately
buying something from you, tracking

139
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:41,025
the transaction data is also important
because that tells you what are, like,

140
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:44,464
what do customers like, doing with your
website or with your app so that gives

141
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,295
you a lot of, lot more information.

142
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:52,805
So once we have all this data
collected, this data needs to be

143
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,089
integrated at a customer grain level.

144
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,089
Meaning for every customer
company like once integration is

145
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,589
completed for every customer's.

146
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:05,654
For every customer company should be able
to help understand, okay, like how many

147
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:10,465
transactions this customer had made in the
last 30 days or in the last 30, 60 days.

148
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:14,475
What are the frequently bought
products or services by this customer?

149
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:17,335
What do they do when they
come to a website or like when

150
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,595
they come, when they use app?

151
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:23,725
So by having this single unified
360 degree view of a customer, it

152
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,705
becomes very easy to truly understand.

153
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,905
Who what is that individual
customer do and like what their

154
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,225
preferences and needs are.

155
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,335
And that leads to better
outcomes, better experience for

156
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,625
customers at the end of the day.

157
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:42,505
So that the very first step is how do
they integrate all these data sources

158
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:49,435
together so that it gives the foundation
to do the next things in this framework.

159
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:54,165
So moving on to the
next one once a robust.

160
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:58,905
In data, like robust data
integration is completed.

161
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:02,895
The next step is extracting
actionable and meaningful insights.

162
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,475
Sort of it, and it's typically
a four step process where it

163
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,695
starts with data refinement.

164
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:14,905
Typically raw data, is will, may
not give you better insights.

165
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:18,205
So there needs to be sometimes
spent on cleaning that data,

166
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,095
structuring that data in a way that.

167
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,840
It can be used for insights generation.

168
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,250
So once the data refinement step is
completed, the next step is doing

169
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,310
some data analytics on top of that
to understand and do some pattern

170
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,940
recognition to see what do customers
love to do, like what sort of patterns

171
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,480
or behaviors they exhibit when it comes
to a specific product or a service.

172
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,080
And from there, the next
step is insight generation.

173
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,530
This is where all these raw
patterns are translated into.

174
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,160
Business relevant customer
specific insights.

175
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,090
And once these insights are
produced, the very important step is

176
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,040
actually acting on these insights.

177
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,210
Generating insights is one thing,
but acting on these insights

178
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,640
is where we actually see better
improvements to customer experience.

179
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,230
We see improvements to metrics like csat,
NPS, so I think acting on these insights.

180
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,695
Is far more important than
just producing insights.

181
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,785
So that insights to action
is a very important step that

182
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,165
companies needs to act on.

183
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:25,825
So once you have a robust data foundation
built, and once you have these insights

184
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,095
started to come in, like that's
when you start to see the benefits.

185
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:36,195
Of like improvements in your CX metrics
or benefits in terms of better retention

186
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:39,735
or like better engagement with products
and services that a company offers?

187
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:45,105
The next step in this
process is incorporating ai.

188
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:50,055
So using AI or machine learning
can be done in numerous ways.

189
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,425
I'm just highlighting few examples here.

190
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,485
Through ai, ml, companies can have.

191
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,880
More intelligent virtual assistants,
like nowadays, chatbots have become

192
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,190
a huge trend in terms of using
incorporating genea and everything to

193
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,360
build chatbots so that they can help
assist customers to solve their issues.

194
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,320
Rather than driving all these all
these customers to a customer service

195
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,720
center or a contact center these
chart boards can actually help to

196
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,520
solve a lot of problems upfront.

197
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,420
So that.

198
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:24,395
You can companies can reduce the
traffic or they reduce the cost to

199
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,555
in terms of customer service as well.

200
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,350
And then the other thing is personalized
recommendations as we discussed in the

201
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,350
earlier slides, companies, customers
want more personalized interactions,

202
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,840
more personalized experiences, and AI is
enabler of these personalized experiences.

203
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,675
Using ai ML companies can take advantage
of, the data that they have and understand

204
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:50,935
like what are the historical behaviors
that were exhibited by these customers.

205
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,725
And use that data to predict what
I mean what can be done for these

206
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:59,775
customers based on their past past
behaviors, past transactions, everything.

207
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,575
And then practice service alerts.

208
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:04,885
I mean by, by, by integrating ai.

209
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,660
Companies can try to predict, what could
be the potential issues or customer

210
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,400
issues that may arise in future so that
we are having the proactive strategy

211
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,480
to mitigate these issues rather
than being very reactive in nature.

212
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,870
And also, through an lp through machine
learning, through NLP companies can

213
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,680
actually take advantage of all the
feedback data that they have received

214
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,615
from customers and try to understand
what is the sentiment expressed.

215
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:33,085
By these customers?

216
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,615
Is it positive, is it negative?

217
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:39,655
And if it is negative, like what is the
best way to route that particular customer

218
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:44,725
to his appropriate agent or appropriate
our team so that it helps to resolve

219
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:49,985
those problems early on rather than
just leaving customers out in the dust.

220
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:55,265
At the end of the day, the whole
purpose of incorporating AI

221
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,425
into translating into like a.

222
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,600
Making improvements for customer
experience is we want to see

223
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,970
better outcomes because of this.

224
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,640
We want to see higher
customer satisfaction scores.

225
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,060
We want to see improved loyalty from
customers for brand, and we want

226
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,780
to see improved retention rates for
these customers because those will

227
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,925
really translate into meaningful
bottom improvements in bottom

228
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,335
line metrics for a given company.

229
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:26,235
So let's spend some time
understanding how can companies

230
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:28,845
drive CX transformation using ai.

231
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:35,375
If we were to think about it AI is
completely reshaping the way that that a

232
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,265
lot of con industries operate nowadays.

233
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:41,455
And see a customer experience is
also is also a no stranger to this

234
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:45,545
transformation by incorporating
AI into customer experience.

235
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:52,185
Companies can completely reshape the
customer interactions by blending advanced

236
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,345
technology with human-centric design.

237
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:58,255
These are like few examples as
in how companies can leverage

238
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,205
AI to drive CX transformation.

239
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,975
Like one is predictive
and cognitive experiences.

240
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,550
These AI systems can anticipate
customer needs before they

241
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,250
even before they even arise.

242
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,390
So by having systems in place that
can actually understand what customer

243
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,160
wants, the companies are being very
proactive in figuring out the needs

244
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,195
of the customer and deliver those
to customers beforehand itself.

245
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:27,230
So that will lead to better customer
experience as a whole for customers.

246
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,010
And then the second one is
omnichannel journey orchestration.

247
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,940
We talked about how personalization is
becoming very critical for customers,

248
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,950
and having this personal personalization
embedded into every aspect of a

249
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,130
customer journey is going to be a truly
game changer for a lot of companies.

250
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,530
So companies can take advantage
of integrating AI in that whole.

251
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:53,285
Customer journey lifecycle so that
delivers more superior and more

252
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:57,275
personalized experience for customers,
which will ultimately lead to better

253
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:01,025
enhancements in terms of customer
metrics, customer satisfaction

254
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,945
metrics or other CX metrics.

255
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,585
Last but not least is
augmented human service.

256
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:12,305
This is where I mean by having EA
systems in place, customer service

257
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:18,110
representatives or associates can have,
better insights about a customer for more

258
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,400
effective interaction with the customer.

259
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,680
Like by having systems in place that can
tell what meaning, like who that customer

260
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,620
is, what are their preferences and needs
and having these insights, making it

261
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,610
available to service representatives
can make it easy for them to deliver.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,160
That, that superior experience to
these customers as part of their

263
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,220
interactions when they reach out to
a customer service representative.

264
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,130
So these are some of the ways in
which AI is going to reshape the

265
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,450
customer experience as a whole.

266
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,550
The end goal is, again, as I
discussed in the previous slide,

267
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,740
the end goal is the same like it is
to deliver that more personalized.

268
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,130
Experienced experiences to
customers so that will ultimately

269
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,020
improve all the metrics related to
customers, related to the company.

270
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,530
And if we were to understand like
what is the role of AI and ML and CX

271
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,940
transformation here, we are going much
more deeper into what are some of the

272
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,440
ways companies can actually employ AI
ML in their transformation journey.

273
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,355
Like predictive analytics
still is one good example.

274
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:27,105
This is where like machine learning
models can actually look at the data

275
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:31,845
that you have, that companies have about
customers and use the data to predict

276
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:37,485
or forecast customer behaviors so that
companies can proactively plan and

277
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,645
meet the evolving needs of customers.

278
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:43,820
And there is the, there is this
real time decision aspect also

279
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,800
now with AI powered systems.

280
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,770
They can actually process
data in real time.

281
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,760
Pro data related to customer
interactions in related real

282
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,860
time across different channels.

283
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,090
And that will lead to
personalized responses.

284
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,020
Personalized experiences ultimately drives
improvement in customer satisfaction.

285
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,170
And a IB is being employed heavily
when it comes to automation.

286
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,150
Or by auto, by using AI for automation.

287
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,900
A lot of rapid two tasks,
particularly in the context of

288
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,520
customer service, can be automated.

289
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,850
So that way it gives it frees up
the time for human agents and they

290
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,660
can focus on complex issues and
providing more empathetic support

291
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,230
and solving bigger problems or
like bigger issues for customers.

292
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,400
So automation is gonna play a
very key role in terms of driving

293
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,050
CX transformation in future.

294
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,970
And last, but not least,
is personalization.

295
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,300
This is the, this is a theme that
we've been touching from the beginning,

296
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,310
that personalization is very crucial
nowadays to elevate customer experience.

297
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,830
So by having more advanced AI platforms
and systems that can analyze customer data

298
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,770
to deeply understand what customer wants.

299
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,360
And delivering those personalized
experiences is a real game changer for the

300
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,860
company when it comes to differentiating,
like when it comes to differentiating

301
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,480
itself from its competitors.

302
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,100
Now let's spend some time to
understand how can companies prepare

303
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,580
for this transformation, because this
is not just a one night or a one.

304
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:23,855
Like one month thing.

305
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,235
It is a continuous process.

306
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:26,825
It takes time, it takes effort.

307
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:31,625
More importantly, it
means changing things.

308
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,610
Cha changing things or systems
that were done certain way.

309
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,780
So the very first thing that I
would, that I want to touch upon

310
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,290
is it requires mindset shift.

311
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,425
Which means like, it requires that culture
shift in within the company because.

312
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,010
Unless, until there is the true
change in culture, it becomes really

313
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,560
tricky for companies to adapt onto
like to get onto this journey.

314
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,420
So having that customer centric, data
driven mindset is really crucial for

315
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,240
companies to have the CX transformation.

316
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,110
Also, companies need to invest in
developing their employees to work

317
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,460
with these new tools, new AI tools,
new AI systems, because otherwise.

318
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,180
They'll be left behind and become it,
and it becomes really tricky for them

319
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,920
to take advantage of these tools.

320
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,570
Also, there needs to be a
strong data governance strategy.

321
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,400
There are teams at various companies
like for the, for the companies that

322
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,780
have done really well in this space.

323
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,300
They have strong data governance teams
that look at what, like what is the data

324
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,980
that they're collecting from customers?

325
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:40,835
What sort of data quality they're
maintaining and they have a very strong,

326
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,285
robust framework when it comes to
maintaining privacy of the data also.

327
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:48,395
So it is very important for
companies to have this strong

328
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:52,475
data governance frameworks in
place to take care of this data.

329
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:56,225
And ultimately companies
need to measure this, right?

330
00:21:56,225 --> 00:22:01,890
You can't simply go on a. Go on and then
say, I'm gonna do CX transformation.

331
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,700
You need to quantitatively measure
like how, what is the success criteria

332
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,160
to say we achieved CX transformation.

333
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,240
So companies need to establish
certain KPAs and metrics to

334
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,260
measure this whole process.

335
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,500
It can be a. Taking a look at
customer experience metrics like

336
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,020
csat, NPS, effort score, whatnot.

337
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,010
Or it can be looking at
like revenue led metric.

338
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,335
Like what's the gross sales,
like what's the do sale volume?

339
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:31,340
Or like what look what is, what are the
bottom line metrics, top line metrics, how

340
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,390
are they trending after CX transformation,
prior to CX transformation?

341
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,640
So by having that robust
framework to measure this is

342
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,480
going to be really crucial.

343
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,680
For leaders to invest in this whole thing.

344
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,130
In addition to that as
I was saying, right?

345
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,630
In addition to that, it requires cultural
and organizational change because

346
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,840
that mindset, mind mindsets shift are
like the change is very important.

347
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,140
It is very important for
executors to really believe in

348
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,840
this data driven cx otherwise.

349
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,295
If there is no leadership support or
executive support, it becomes really

350
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:12,755
tricky and challenging for companies to
act on this like to execute on this thing.

351
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,055
Also, it's not a one team effort.

352
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:22,265
It is a cross-functional teams
collaboration where like teams from IT,

353
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:24,735
marketing, customer support or product.

354
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:28,485
They all need to come together and then
they all need to collectively think

355
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:31,395
about customer experience as an end goal.

356
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:36,925
And form teams accordingly, set set
objectives and strategies accordingly and

357
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:39,955
try to deliver on the CX transformation.

358
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:46,255
Last but not least is companies need
to empower the frontline employees.

359
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:52,015
I. Meaning they need to educate them,
give access to these customer insights

360
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:55,255
because they're the ones, at the end
of the day, they are the ones who

361
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:59,455
talk to a customer who interact with
customers face-to-face at times, if

362
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,165
it is a physical store or something.

363
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:07,505
So these frontline staff staff also need
to have access to these insights so that

364
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:09,695
they can serve customers in a better way.

365
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:14,395
Give that the, give them that sense
of, having a better experience when

366
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:17,245
they visit the store or when they
interact with this frontline staff.

367
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:22,195
So I think encouraging the frontline
staff to actually look into these

368
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:27,685
insights and figure out a way to have
an empathetic view towards the towards

369
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:32,125
these customers and like delivering
better experience at the end of the day

370
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:37,475
becomes really important for a company to
succeed in the CX transformation journey.

371
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:42,425
So that's why like it starts with that
cultural and organizational change.

372
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:45,655
And it needs to have that
strong support from leadership.

373
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:49,835
It needs to have that collaboration with
cross-functional teams and ultimately

374
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:54,485
everyone in the company should be
empowered to enhance customer experience.

375
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,810
So with that, I would like
to conclude the presentation.

376
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,040
I hope this presentation helps you
to gain some insights into how can

377
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,230
companies drive CX transformation.

378
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,915
What are the like what's the, what
are the frameworks they can employ to,

379
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:15,655
to get on this journey and ultimately
achieve the CX transformation journey?

380
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:18,725
I hope you enjoyed the talk
and it's a great pleasure to.

381
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:22,115
Speak at this con 40 to
machine learning 2025.

382
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:23,555
So thanks for the opportunity.
