1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,590
I wanna talk about hybrid quantum,
classical neural networks and

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,030
their application to the field
of Cy Hybrid Engineering.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,010
As you'll know, like the quantum
computing field is picking up,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,410
Google has launched a new chip
Willow and so has Amazon recently,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,145
and they have passed the benchmarks.

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:31,835
But to make use of them practically
now for especially the emergence of AI

7
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:37,405
and machine learning, we are looking
into the hybrid approach of hybrid

8
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,865
quantum and classical neural networks.

9
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:46,444
I have briefly split the agenda into
hybrid quantum classical neural networks.

10
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,365
I'll say HQC and Ns.

11
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:52,474
Very long to pronounce the
challenges that are in this

12
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,134
approach, the practical applications.

13
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:57,344
And the SRA aspect of it.

14
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,164
Okay, so

15
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:02,324
the left column talks about
the quantum advantages.

16
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:06,814
So quantum computing takes advantage
of the quantum principles of physics.

17
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,094
Which is super position.

18
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:18,784
Super position has the ability of
data to be in all the possible states

19
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,624
at once before it's being observed.

20
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:29,994
If you take in binary, we call it a zero
or one, it could be a zero or one, or.

21
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:33,224
Both zero and one before
it is being observed.

22
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:39,044
So this arises to the concept of parallel
invoices and the ability to solve the

23
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:42,194
problem parallel, in parallel invoices.

24
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:46,704
And quantum ment is the
ability of one qubit.

25
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:51,425
Qubit is the basic unit of like
a bit of quantum computers.

26
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:55,765
Ability of one qubit to to
affect the other, to the same

27
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,164
state respect of their distance.

28
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,895
This adds tremendous power
to quantum computing.

29
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:07,924
And the modeling, the modeling of quantum
states using hilbert spaces, provides

30
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:10,299
unprecedented power to solve problems.

31
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:15,259
And as the classical strengths, it's
well established like what charge

32
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:20,819
GPD is using or, any other tropic
or any other your network is using.

33
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,599
They're using regular binary com,
or not regular, but established

34
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,959
high GPU classical computers
when you fuse both of them.

35
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:34,929
So basically, you are using
the accommodation of classical.

36
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,279
You basically provide the
problem in classical, which

37
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,719
is encoded into quantum state.

38
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,219
And you return the result back
in classical after validation

39
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,629
that provides unprecedented
problem solving capabilities.

40
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:47,459
Okay.

41
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,099
Now enters the.

42
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,510
Parameterized quantum circuits, but they
are quantum algorithms that incorporate

43
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:01,549
tunable parameters within quantum
gates, enabling optimization of tasks.

44
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,930
As you can see in this dis, in this
graphic, the presentation, so there is a

45
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,680
feature mapping part below which basically
maps the classical part features to the,

46
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,229
classical features to the quantum states
and the quantum parameters are tunable

47
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,599
elements with within the quantum circuits
that enable optimization for specific

48
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,789
tasks such as quantum machine learning,
classical gradient based techniques.

49
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:33,929
The one that is used in the last piece
classical optimization, are tuneable

50
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:38,189
elements within quantum circuits
that enable optimization for specific

51
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,079
tasks and techniques like gradient
doesn't are foundational, which

52
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,869
it iteratively are just parameters
to minimize the cost function.

53
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:47,549
Okay.

54
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,139
I think the slide is slightly.

55
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,199
Your slide is slightly bigger.

56
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,670
So this one, it this slide compares
the HQ CNNs with the traditional

57
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,380
classical neural networks.

58
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,670
And you can see that HQ CNNs
consistently outperform the.

59
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,260
The classical computers and their,
the Neur network approach, despite

60
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,040
having noisy data, and we still have
stability issues with qubits, which

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,070
just had to be resolved, especially in
a complex, high dimensional tasks like

62
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,260
medical diagnostics or drug discovery.

63
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,380
So it's got a huge implication on
basically us think of it like this,

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,450
if you can find the vaccine for Q
Covid within hours rather than months.

65
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:38,039
See the impact can have on the
number of lives that we could save.

66
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,590
So there is a potential of this approach.

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,470
Okay, I'm going to reshare.

68
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:43,255
Okay,

69
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:46,245
so now comes how do we train

70
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,755
quantum circuit, steep quantum circuits.

71
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,635
First is the circuit initialization.

72
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,220
Where you structure quantum layers
with appropriate gate operations

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,570
and parameter optimization, applying
grade dissent based methods.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,430
Next is error mitigation.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,920
And finally, you evaluate the model.

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,280
Basically, you take a known known
benchmark and you, you run it both

77
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,690
in the classical as well as on the
hybrid quantum computer, and then

78
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,850
confirm that the quantum works.

79
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,590
Or it is within the benchmark of the
classical, computers for accuracy.

80
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,329
Okay?

81
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:23,219
Yeah.

82
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:28,089
So the advantages of high dimensional
computation, as in the sa in the slide.

83
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:31,679
It speeds up like qu the
things that we talked about.

84
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:36,269
It's made up of qubits and it
has got the the typical quantum

85
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:42,319
advantages of superposition and
entanglement and quantum parallelism.

86
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,599
So basically it is almost like having
parallel invoices to solve a problem.

87
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:51,649
You can think about the consequence
of that thought and, especially

88
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,549
on high dimensional data.

89
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:56,289
High dimensional data which
requires basically a lot of possible

90
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,929
ways to look into the solution.

91
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,949
They offer, they're very greatly
efficient, especially compared

92
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,579
to the classical representation,
efficient optimization, quantum

93
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,354
gardens boss solution landscapes,
like assume you have you want to come

94
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,724
up with a financial modeling and.

95
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:18,224
You want to say what happens
when I do it on this day?

96
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:22,794
If you want to take the 365 days of a
year and calculate the interest and the

97
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:27,474
subsequent pension that you'll receive
after six 60 years, the classical computer

98
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:31,854
will struggle, but whereas the quantum
can easily model that in just a fee.

99
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:32,904
Yeah.

100
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:37,854
The dimensionality advantage hybrid
architectures seamlessly integrate

101
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,864
both quantum and classical data sets.

102
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:44,514
Basically it maintains the regular
computing advantages, the practical use

103
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:48,984
of it, and also the quantum advantages,
which is the ability of IT to solve

104
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,324
problems with high emission spaces.

105
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:52,094
Yeah.

106
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,854
Now let's look at some
of the applications.

107
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:55,694
It's very exciting.

108
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:59,204
Like we, whatever we talk till
now, it's more like a theory,

109
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:01,004
but this is practical, right?

110
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:06,604
Especially in medical diagnostics,
like if to read an MRI scan or a or

111
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:11,584
combining multiple data, multiple
scans together and deriving conclusions

112
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:16,754
out of it, or, which can be critical
for the patient's diagnosis.

113
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:22,130
So this offers unparalleled potential
drug discovery, as I mentioned.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,840
Like we.

115
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,480
Already we are doing a little bit like
Covid was done pretty fast, but quantum

116
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,535
can do it within no time, almost like
minutes or day or hours, which basically

117
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:40,585
gives us the ability to think about
novel drugs, which can completely change

118
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,249
the life of people and cure diseases.

119
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:45,479
Yeah.

120
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,164
The other frontier is the
personalized medicine.

121
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,014
You have multiple data sets, right?

122
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:55,294
You have the clinical data where you go
to a GP or have your medical test and

123
00:07:55,864 --> 00:08:00,544
the environment that you live in your
pre predisposition, your genomic data.

124
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:06,624
The HQ n they can combine all of
these and produce very personalized.

125
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,869
Medicine, like the one that
perfectly works for you, depending

126
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:14,799
on all the parameters, which may
not be so easy to do right now.

127
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:19,789
As I talked the model the potential
applications are in financial modeling.

128
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:20,889
Gimme one second.

129
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,374
Trying to move this.

130
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:23,114
Okay.

131
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:24,344
Financial modeling.

132
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,704
Then again the supply chain logistics
it's like an operational such problem.

133
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:34,494
You have limited resources and what
is the best way to, for the cost being

134
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:36,319
optimized or the faster delivery.

135
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,019
For critical medical emergencies
or it's a very good area to

136
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,549
work on supply chain logistics.

137
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,709
And it can help itself.

138
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:48,799
It can design efficient quantum and
classical circuit layouts, which

139
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,999
can make it even more efficient.

140
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:50,389
Efficient.

141
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,260
And also one benchmarks like they
have demonstrated that for 200.

142
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,470
Plus training iterations.

143
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,280
The variance is only between 2%,
which is pretty high for accuracy.

144
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,240
Stability,

145
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,070
okay.

146
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,990
The way we train a quantum
hq, hybrid QU hq, CNNs is.

147
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,270
We have to first have the dataset
create a classical dataset, and then

148
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,200
we have to prepare it into a format
that's digestible by the quantum

149
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,240
computers, like amplitude amplitude.

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,130
So basically you convert that into
a voltage or a, or direction, like

151
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,150
a phase sample, and then encoding
the feature ma maps to preserve

152
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,500
the critical relationships.

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,890
Okay.

154
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,470
And next, like executed forward pass
is, they do one iteration, move forward

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,090
to perform complex transformations on
the encoded data, and then the data is

156
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,980
sent back to classical back propagation.

157
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,080
Propagate propagation is enabling
efficient organization across the quantum

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,250
and class, so quantum has computed the
data is available in the quantum format.

159
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:58,275
You need to pass it on to the classical
format and hybrid optimization.

160
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:02,375
Systematically refined parameters to
iterative quantum classical feedback log.

161
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,925
So basically the earlier ones that we
created, indecent, we saw that, right?

162
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:10,285
So you keep on doing iteratively
to optimize the hybrid system.

163
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:11,895
It's not very straightforward.

164
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,275
There are a lot of challenges.

165
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:18,795
It's in the much, still in the state of
infancy, but it's quite an interesting

166
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,535
problem and eventually we'll get there.

167
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:25,745
So one is quantum de coherence, like
the challenges I mean despite we say

168
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:29,235
that the qubits have we have made
it much better than what it was, but

169
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,975
still they suffer from instability.

170
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:35,855
And the error mitigation techniques
are still work in progress.

171
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:36,695
And

172
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,595
scalability is one issue.

173
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:41,705
And barren plat like when the.

174
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:47,275
Is a critical training problem in quantum
machine learning, QML, specifically in

175
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:51,625
training p QCs, parameterize quantum
circuits using gradient based methods.

176
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:57,155
So basically when the when the quantum
circuit becomes deeper and deeper the.

177
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,835
The gradient vanishes.

178
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,865
So that is a problem, that's
a common problem or a problem

179
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,005
that's studied deeply.

180
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:07,415
Barr plats and the classical quantum
interface, the data transfer between

181
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,125
our classical systems and quantum.

182
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,575
They create bottlenecks and hybrid
algorithms must minimize the server.

183
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,495
Okay, so the future outlook, as Google.

184
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:21,525
Amazon, Microsoft, everyone is working
towards, even in media, they're working

185
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:27,245
towards more quantum computing chips with
more qubits, coherence and gate fidelity.

186
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,065
And on the software side, the
algorithms are also improving.

187
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:32,445
No hybrid architectures are created.

188
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:37,335
And the other thing is know we are
talking this is now happening in

189
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:42,915
labs in some universities or in some,
like top top companies, labs, or

190
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,715
RD divisions, but it has to become
a widespread industry adoption.

191
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:52,555
And the quantum and machine learning
has to become a standard, HQs,

192
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,915
but they will surely revolutionize
the computational approach.

193
00:11:56,185 --> 00:12:00,205
And when this matures solving the
problems that we could not solve earlier

194
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,825
or could not even think about earlier.

195
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:07,245
Now the relevance of, now we, we discussed
about quantum, we discussed about

196
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:13,395
classical and how HQ c, hybrid quantum
quantum computing neural network model

197
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:19,395
like computers how how they work and how
they can help us in drug discovery and

198
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,305
personalized medicine, financial modeling.

199
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,505
We talked about all that.

200
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:23,165
Now.

201
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,850
What are the problems from Ari?

202
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,450
Perspective?

203
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,320
One is the handoffs is a point of
failure and because the movement

204
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,530
of data from classical to quantum,
so that's a point of failure.

205
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,570
So we from ARI perspective systems
have to be Ari, have to design robust

206
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,220
interfaces and ensure that, that there
is no data loss or data transformation.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,020
The other, one other important piece I
want to talk about is the observability.

208
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,500
Okay?

209
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,490
Now, if you have a cloud computing
system, you have a way to observe it.

210
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,680
So how do you observe a quantum state?

211
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,150
How do you observe quantum noise?

212
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,980
How do you observe quantum decoherence?

213
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,590
And how do you observe latency?

214
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,390
How do you know the
models performing well?

215
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,770
Is it not drifting away?

216
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,120
How do you know all those things?

217
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
So observability is a many important part.

218
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,235
Part of it.

219
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,565
And error mitigation strategies, right?

220
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:17,765
If there is an error during a handoff or
initial data encoding, how do you come

221
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:20,535
up with ways to, mitigate the errors?

222
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:21,465
Okay.

223
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,875
And scalability is another problem.

224
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:24,985
And deploying.

225
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:25,375
Okay.

226
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,665
There suppose be there is a new model
that's getting deployed, so how do

227
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,585
you deploy it into the quantum space?

228
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:36,865
Do we need any special orchestration
techniques, ization strategies

229
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:41,170
where the have to come up with
new models and something that they

230
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,430
have not thought about till now.

231
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,480
And

232
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,220
SREs were supporting that they have to.

233
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,920
They have to ensure that they can deliver
a level of repeatability, load drift.

234
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,440
And even when the system is loaded
with a heavy model or load tested

235
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,960
parallelly, it should not drift.

236
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,360
And it, it produces the same
consistent, pro consistent

237
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,710
performance even during load.

238
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,150
Okay SRE must manage the handoffs,
error mitigation as we talked

239
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,140
about earlier, and monitoring and
observability and scalability, right?

240
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,285
Like how do you suppose you want more
clusters, how do you scale on demand?

241
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:22,875
Can you do it within few milliseconds so
that there is no loss in the performance.

242
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:27,285
Those kind of things are very critical
for for an SRE and I put together, put

243
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:33,175
put together a set of references for you,
the one from IPM and the parameterized

244
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:39,845
quantum circuits, and, or how to build
reliability by IBM and practical use.

245
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:45,615
Recently U Austin, they came up with
a way to test whether the numbers that

246
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:50,445
are generated by a quantum computer is
really random using a classical computer.

247
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:54,340
I put across some references
or you like it and it's, you

248
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,300
learn something out of it.

249
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,090
Yeah, that's all I have.

250
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,080
Hope you like it.

251
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,770
Thank you very much.
