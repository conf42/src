00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,530
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,670
Myself, Ji.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,050
I have more than 14 years of
experience in CRM systems.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,450
Today we are going to discuss about the
A power CM policy and how it is impacting

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,830
between the innovation and surveillance.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,810
This presentation explains how a
driven CRM system transform community

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,560
policy while raising important
questions about the server lines and

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,970
similarities raise of a port policy.

9
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:32,369
There are three main key impacted areas,
widespread adoption, miserable impact,

10
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:35,129
community focus in widespread adoption.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,480
A CRM system now manage millions
subsidies, interactions annually

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,760
across major metropol areas.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,050
Miserable impact departments
report significance, improvement in

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,310
response, coordination and feedback
Collection and community focus.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,900
Neutral C enable more targeted community
engagement and resource allocation.

16
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:57,975
Benefits of a driven system.

17
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:00,795
There are main benefits
of the A driven system.

18
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:06,255
Sentiment analysis, faster response,
performance tracking, sentiment

19
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:11,115
analysis, algorithm flag, community
detections with high accuracy,

20
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:12,375
allowing prevention accents.

21
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:16,245
This means it collects the data
from the different sources like

22
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:20,745
9 1 1 calls, case management,
citizen compliance, and retracts.

23
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:21,285
Ignore them.

24
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,085
Faster response.

25
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:28,365
Predictive alert systems have reduced
response time in high risk areas for

26
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,794
performance tracking officer engagement.

27
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:34,365
Screen courts correlated with
improved community satisfaction.

28
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:42,615
There are success cases, 24% response
time, average reduction in emergency

29
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:47,925
response times across implementation
departments, and 37% satisfaction

30
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,785
increase in the community satisfactory
scores where systems are transparent.

31
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:59,445
42% engagement, more citizen police
and positive interaction reported

32
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:00,915
in participating communities.

33
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:08,085
The shadow side of the algorithm bias
unfair targeting of certain communities.

34
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:13,395
Documented case shows greater algorithm
flagging in minority communities

35
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,735
despite similar incident rates.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,640
The enforcement cycles are
systems that learn from historical

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,410
data, often perpetuate existing
bias in policy patterns, and

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,450
as well as limited warfare too.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,270
Public trust concerns the data
collections, use policies and

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,090
surveillance spheres when it
comes to the data collections.

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,590
Citizens often unaware of how the personal
data is being gathered when citizens

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,690
don't understand how decisions are made.

43
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:45,765
The database collected and
how it is going to be used.

44
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:52,755
So in this case, the trash can be broken
down, uses policies, unclear boundaries

45
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:59,775
on how information affects polishing
decisions, subline fears, especially in

46
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:04,185
communities that have already exposed
reward policy, the lack of transparency

47
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,015
make it even harder to build trust

48
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:10,515
community, a transparency framework.

49
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:14,625
There are four core principles of
community transparency framework.

50
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:21,495
One is visibility documentation,
participation review visibility.

51
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:25,605
Public facing dashboard shows how
algorithm make recommendations,

52
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:31,995
the documentation, citizen
accessible engagement logs, track

53
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,855
all system guidance, interactions.

54
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:37,995
That means they should be able to
track their cases, how it was routed.

55
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,025
Who was resolved on what basis?

56
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:45,225
They resolved participation,
community involvement in system

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,855
design and implementation, like
hosting public workshops at town

58
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:54,225
halls, reviewing mandated third party
algorithm audit conductor quarterly.

59
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:59,865
Just like companies have independent
financial audit, a system that how affect

60
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,144
public should regularly fairness audits

61
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,005
the framework results in pilot cities.

62
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,059
Boston implementation Ocland
Pilot Denver Adoption.

63
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,620
Boston implementation Trust in
policy technology increased 40 some

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,269
percent after dashboard launches.

65
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,769
Citizen complaints about
technology misses dropped by 62%.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,979
The Ocland Pilot community or site
committee review all algorithms changes

67
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:34,180
public trust metrics improve 31% first
year of the implementation, then adaption.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,219
Quarterly town hall discussion, CM
Insights with distance due to this

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,450
engagement with the police portal
increased 83% after transparency measure

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,520
key framework conference, public
dashboards, technical documentation,

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,210
citizen review boards impact as these
are the four key components of framework.

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,919
So when it comes to public dashboard,
real time display of algorithm activity.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,780
And impact accessible to the all
citizens technical documentation.

74
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,500
Simplified explanation of how
a systems make recommendation.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,289
Citizen review board community members
participating in the quarterly algorithm

76
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,940
reviews, impact assessment, regular
evaluation of these system effects

77
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,620
and different demo group groups.

78
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,789
There are four ways of implementation
pathways assessment, adaption, community

79
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,440
engagement, continuous improvements.

80
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:37,344
When it come to the assessment, conduct
comprehensive audit of existing AI

81
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,945
systems and gather technical community
feedback on specific concepts.

82
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,544
Adaption when it comes to the adaption.

83
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:48,715
Implement technical modification to
enhance algorithm transparency and

84
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,784
establish clear accountability protocols.

85
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:52,525
Community engagement.

86
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,695
Create formal channels for
citizens Prep citizens.

87
00:05:56,695 --> 00:06:01,284
Participants in the system review with the
documented feedback integration process.

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,720
Continuous implement, established
quarterly independent audit

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,940
and systematic implementation
of evidence based on defense.

90
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,040
There are proven stakeholders,
benefits, law enforcement,

91
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,270
community member, government
officials in the law enforcement.

92
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,190
Increasing community trust leads to
better information sharing and cooperation

93
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,740
officers report less stress from
community tensions, community members.

94
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:34,044
Greater understanding of how the
data is used, reduced, and it

95
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,455
reduces the fear of the serve lines.

96
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,325
Visible feedback loops show
input creates the real changes.

97
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,984
Government officials reduce the
tension between the police and

98
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,664
community measure communities.

99
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:48,414
Measurable improvement in public
satisfaction with governance,

100
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:54,354
technical recommendations, open source
components, data minimization, bias

101
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:58,469
testing, citizen control, so when it
come to the open source components.

102
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,890
Critical algorithms should be
open for the public review while

103
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,210
protecting security elements.

104
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,369
The data minimization collect only
necessary information with clear

105
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:14,739
retention and detention policies,
bias testing, regular testing,

106
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,080
edged diverse dataset to identify
that correct and algorithm biases.

107
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:25,599
Citizen control allow individual
to view and manage their data with

108
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,950
reasonable security constraints.

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,549
Balancing innovation rights.

110
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,030
A CM system offers powerful
tools for improving policy.

111
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,780
Their benefits must be balanced with
transparency and accountability.

112
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,039
The community algorithm transparency
framework provides a proven path forward.

113
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,705
Thank you everyone.
