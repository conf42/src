00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,099
transparent, interpretable insights.

175
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:55,839
This cutting edge system leverages
sophisticated visualization tools and

176
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,994
natural language processing to break
down the AI decisions into clear.

177
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:05,814
Step by step reasoning path
with an outstanding 95 percent

178
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,804
regulatory adherence rate.

179
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:11,554
These frameworks generate the
comprehensive audit trials

180
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:17,144
that document every factor
influencing automated decision.

181
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:22,374
From risk assessment variables to
climb the processing parameters.

182
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:27,844
The implementation of explainable
AI has proven transformative

183
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,464
for the customer relationships.

184
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:35,244
Driving an 85 percent reduction in
disputes through the detailed, jargon free

185
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:39,984
explanations of underwriting decisions
and claim assessments by bridging the

186
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:45,224
gap between advanced AI capabilities and
human understanding, these frameworks

187
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:52,434
have become indispensable tools for the
insurers committed to build trust while

188
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:55,194
maintaining technological innovations.

189
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:56,634
Thank you so much.
