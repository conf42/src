1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,860
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,510
My name is Navin Carri.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,850
I'm truly excited to be speaking
today at Con 42 Machine Learning 2025.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,030
Today I'll be discussing a mission
critical topic, optimizing high

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,340
availability and disaster recovery
strategies for cloud SAP systems.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
In today's digital world, downtime
isn't just inconvenient, it's

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,930
expensive, disruptive, and can
cause major operational risks.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,210
To give you a sense of just how
important SAP systems are, SAP forms the

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,100
backbones of critical business operations
for organizations around the world.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,040
In fact, about 84% of
Fortune 500 companies.

11
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:56,955
Relay on SAP to manage their enterprise
resource planning functions, covering

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:04,845
everything from finance and supply chain
to human resources and customer services.

13
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,445
And it's not just about big enterprises.

14
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:13,875
Over 92 million users interact
with SAP platforms every single

15
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,055
day across more than 180 countries.

16
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,065
This is incredible scale.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,880
A key point to highlight here is when
SAP systems face downtime, it's not

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,730
just a technical issue, it's a major
business risk with a global ripple effect.

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,759
So building a resilience in SAP
environment is in just optional.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,670
It is absolutely essential.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,820
Let's dive into the key strategies that
ensures SAP systems to be available.

22
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,360
Resilient and ready for anything.

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,520
First, let's take a moment
to understand the real world

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,320
impact of SAP system downtime.

25
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,080
Every minute a core SAP system is offline
costs an average of $8,750, and without

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,570
proper high availability strategies,
incidents can stretch beyond four hours.

27
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,000
This adds up quickly.

28
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:24,690
Uh, leading to over $2.2 million law,
potential losses per incident beyond

29
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,480
the financial implications, um, the
operational impact is more alarming.

30
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:38,730
84. 87% of organizations experience a
significant supply chain disruptions

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,615
within just eight hours of SAP downtime.

32
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,090
And 64% report customer facing
impacts like service delay and

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,679
transaction failures within first
two hours of system unavailability.

34
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,179
These cascading effects
underlines a vital truth.

35
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,480
Downtime is in just a
technical inconvenience.

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,220
It's a major business threat.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,135
It disrupts not only the
internal processes, but also

38
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,375
damages the customer trust.

39
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:13,095
Brand loyalty and revenue streams.

40
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:19,125
This clearly shows us building
res resilience isn't optional.

41
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,075
It's a mission critical.

42
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:30,080
So the now the key question is how do
we build resilience now that we have

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,845
seen the real impact of downtime?

44
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,525
Let's dive deep into the two
key strategies that organization

45
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,385
use to build resilience.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,040
High availability and disaster recovery.

47
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,690
Although they sound similar,
they serve very distinct,

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,030
but equally important roles.

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
First, let's see, with high availability.

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,150
High availability focuses on maintaining
continuous system operations, and even

51
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,580
during component failure, it eliminates
single point of failure within a

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,080
primary production environment using
redundancy and automated failover.

53
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,820
Typically it OP operates
within the same region.

54
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:20,190
Leveraging availability, availability
zones, it usually adds up 15 to 22% of

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,940
the base infrastructure cost, which is a
smart investment to avoid costly times.

56
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:33,599
Um, let's discuss the examples
of, uh, high availability if, um.

57
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:40,995
A single SAP server fails ha ensures that
system continuous functions seamlessly.

58
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,445
User does not even realize
anything went wrong.

59
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:52,065
Um, for an example, if a storage,
uh, device fails, fails over, um, the

60
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:58,245
secondary storage component will take
over and then users see, uh, users

61
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,855
sees seamlessly these transactions.

62
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:01,695
Um.

63
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:06,705
Uh, with the component failover
will be very seamless, um,

64
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,835
in the case of an HR ha.

65
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:13,335
Now let's discuss about
the Dr. Disaster recovery.

66
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:19,125
Disaster recovery addresses large scale
disruptions, things that can be bring

67
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:25,090
down entire environment such as data
center, wide outages or natural disasters.

68
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,610
Dr enables.

69
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,070
Business continuity By recovering
SAP operations in alternative

70
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,280
geographic locations, it usually
spans multiple regions to ensure

71
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,950
true geographic isolations.

72
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:49,140
However, implementing DR can increase
total cost by 28 to 47% depending on the,

73
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,844
uh, organization's recovery objectives.

74
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,675
Uh, let's consider an example
of Dr. If a hurricane wipes

75
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,805
out a data center in Florida.

76
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:06,465
Um, DR allows, um, recovery from secondary
data center, let's say in Texas or, uh,

77
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,110
wherever it is, quickly and reliability.

78
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,045
And, um, here is the important
insight to observe here organizations

79
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:19,545
that implement both HA and d,
DR. Strategies, experience, or.

80
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,710
An average of 35% fewer operational
disruptions compared to, to those

81
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,860
with only partial implementations.

82
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,210
Such as like if, if company operates
only he ha then they don't, um, exper

83
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,490
they don't have the benefits, uh, of
um, 35% fewer operational disruptions.

84
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:48,240
So they need to implement both of these
things to ensure, like achieve 35% of.

85
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:54,375
Um, 35% of fewer operational dis
uh, disruptions, um, disruptions.

86
00:06:54,885 --> 00:07:00,435
When SAP's landscapes are properly
configured, companies can achieve up to

87
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:06,615
99.595 percentage system availability
even in the phase of failures.

88
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:12,195
Now that we understand the differences
between HA and DR, let's move forward.

89
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:15,735
Um, how organizations
are actually putting.

90
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,260
High availability into a practice
by looking at the graph stats.

91
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,350
87% of our production SAP environments
today have some form of a basic

92
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,480
high availability measure in
place, which is a great progress.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,165
But, um, here is where
the gap becomes clear.

94
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,370
Only 53% of these organizations
have fully documented and properly

95
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,860
tested disaster recovery plans.

96
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,300
And this is concerning because
ev, even though 76% of respondents

97
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,120
classify that SAP systems as business
critical, many still operate without

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,150
full disaster recovery protections.

99
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,490
This tells us something important.

100
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,010
High availability isn't alone enough.

101
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,070
Without disaster recovery, organizations
still expose it to significant risk,

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,190
especially during large scale disruptions.

103
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:25,070
High availability and disaster recovery
must go on hand in hand and to truly

104
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,575
protect the business operations.

105
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,390
Now let's take it deeper
into, um, exactly how we build

106
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,039
effectively high availability.

107
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,150
Starting from very foundation
layer infrastructure.

108
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,589
Layer building.

109
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,240
True high availability starts with a
strong foundation, and that foundation

110
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
is infrastructure redundancy.

111
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,400
We start with computer redundancy.

112
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,319
By deploying SAP applications
across multiple availability zones.

113
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,859
This way, if one zone or hardware
component fails, the application continues

114
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,099
running seamlessly, seamlessly in another.

115
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,815
Then we have a network redundancy,
which means setting up redundant

116
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:18,319
network parts, load balancers,
and multiple virtual interfaces.

117
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,015
This eliminates single
point of network failure.

118
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,220
Which are often silent risks, and
of course, storage redundancy.

119
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,569
Leveraging a cloud storage platforms
that automatically replicate

120
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:38,810
data, achieving extremely highly
durable levels, even up to 99.99%.

121
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,410
Each of these compute network
storage acts as a safety net.

122
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,119
Individually.

123
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,109
They are powerful.

124
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:57,365
But together they form a solid and
resilient high availability foundation.

125
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:03,485
And it's not just about a hardware
infrastructure application.

126
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:09,575
Uh, level redundancy is just as important
to maintain the true resilience.

127
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:15,615
Before moving on with the application
resilience, um, Ebo Infrastructure

128
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,445
Foundation, we have one more layer.

129
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,270
Um, database resilience.

130
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,850
Let's, uh, which is the one of the
most critical parts of SAP environment.

131
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,590
Let's discuss about the database
resilience Across leading, uh,

132
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,820
database platforms, there are proven
high availability solutions designed

133
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,730
specifically for minimizing downtime.

134
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:46,230
Let's discuss in this, um, presentation
Hana, SAP Hana, Oracle database card.

135
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:51,225
SQL server, um, SQL server always on.

136
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:56,925
For SAP Hana, uh, system replication
maintains a real time standby

137
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:01,965
instance, enables recovery times
as fast as two to five minutes.

138
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,125
It is extremely popular.

139
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:12,135
About 84% of SAP Hana deployments
rely on it, and 65% of, uh,

140
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:14,085
has fully automated failover.

141
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,140
When it comes to the Oracle data
card, provides synchronous or near

142
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,550
synchronous replications for SAP
systems using Oracle databases.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,150
Typically, um, it achieves, um,
it achieves recovery time within

144
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,060
three to seven minutes after
primary database failovers.

145
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,200
Let's move on to the SQL server.

146
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,575
Always on is used, uh, for SAP.

147
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,870
On SQL server platforms,
implements availability groups.

148
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,840
It achieves average recovery times of
around four minutes after a failover,

149
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,870
after a failover, or sorry, after
a failure, and is adopted roughly

150
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,680
71% of SQL based SAP enrollments.

151
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,810
So across, all across databases,
whether it's an SAP, HANA.

152
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,105
Oracle, Oracle or SQL server.

153
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:10,635
The message is consistent.

154
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:13,995
Replication and failover are not optional.

155
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:22,695
They must tightly integrated and uh, into
any serious high availability strategies.

156
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:30,645
And now that we have covered the,
um, database redundancy, let's move

157
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:36,160
forward and explore the how we build
the resilience for application layer.

158
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:41,895
Now moving up the stack, let's
talk about application level

159
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,235
redundancy at this level.

160
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,865
At this layer, we create a
resilience by load balance load

161
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,725
balancing multiple SAP servers.

162
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:57,820
This ensures that if one server fails
other instantly take over and maintains

163
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:04,785
about 95% normal transaction throughputs
with without the users even noticing.

164
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:16,425
For SAP Central Services, that
a SCS and SCS instance, we

165
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,285
deploy clustering solutions.

166
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:24,930
These allow us to avoid single
point of failure, enabling recovery

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,690
time averaging just 2.5 minutes.

168
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,150
And, uh.

169
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:30,755
It doesn't stop there.

170
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,505
NQ replications ensures that critical
in-flight transactions are protected

171
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,595
even if the primary NQ servers goes down.

172
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:47,610
All of these are backed up by automated
failure mechanisms, which can detect

173
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,850
component fail, uh, failure and instance
recovery within 12 to 30 seconds.

174
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,400
But what hap but what should we, you,
you, what should we know here is,

175
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:10,010
um, the infrastructure components,
what we have, the components

176
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,480
we have, uh, discussed here.

177
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,040
But what happens if the entire
region or data center goes down?

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,340
That's where the disaster
recovery comes into play.

179
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,550
Building a resilience isn't just about
preventing small failures, it's also about

180
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,920
readying for larger regional disruptions.

181
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,500
That's where disaster recovery strategies
add a critical second layer of protection.

182
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:42,510
At the foundation, we start the regular
backups ensuring we always have recent

183
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,819
reliable copies of our SAP data.

184
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,110
Next.

185
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:51,255
We implement cross-regional
replication, which ensures that even

186
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:56,775
it, if an entire region suffers an
outage, our data is still protected

187
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:58,845
and ready in another location.

188
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:06,525
And finally, we bring it all together,
a recovery orchestration, automating

189
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,685
the entire recovery workflow.

190
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:13,155
So when a disaster strikes,
a recovery is fast, smooth,

191
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,195
and minimize the human errors.

192
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:20,235
When all the three layers backup,
replication, and orchestrations

193
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:24,705
are executed properly, mature
disaster recovery strategies can

194
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:28,155
shrink recovery times by 72%.

195
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:36,045
That means a cutting, downtime and
average of, uh, 18.7 hours to 5.2

196
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:43,845
hours, making a huge difference in a.
Making a huge difference in how fast

197
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:49,605
an orchestration can bo uh, can bounce
back By looking at this, uh, normally,

198
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,305
uh, orchestration can bounce back.

199
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:59,895
Now let's explore how major cloud
providers AWS Azure GCP enables

200
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:03,285
enhances high availability and
disaster recoveries in the cloud

201
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:05,815
when it comes to the resilience.

202
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,830
Major cloud providers offer powerful
tools, but each has its own strengths.

203
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,930
Starting with A-W-S-A-W-S
holds 37% market share.

204
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,550
78% of user adopts multi AZ
developments boosting availability

205
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:33,475
from 99.95 to 99.98% EBS snapshots and
elastic disaster recovery services.

206
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,069
Achieve faster recoveries.

207
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,199
Recovery, uh, uh, recoveries.

208
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:46,960
Um, RP was of one to five minutes and
RT was of 15 to 20, 20, 30 minutes.

209
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,310
Moving to Azure with 32% market share.

210
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,960
Azure's availability zones
delivers to 99% availability,

211
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:02,980
site recovery and Azure backups
ensure RP os of five to 15 minutes.

212
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,550
And, uh.

213
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:04,615
Reliable.

214
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:12,085
SAP certified backups and
G-C-P-G-C-P holds 24% market share.

215
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:16,495
The regional persistent discs and
cross regional copy backups are

216
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:21,625
widely adopted and enable fast,
seamlessly recover across the regions.

217
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:29,635
The key takeaway is every cloud has
building blocks of H-A-N-D-R choosing

218
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:32,310
the right fit for your SAP landscape.

219
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,750
Is what truly makes the difference.

220
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,600
Now let's move on from the
cloud responsibilities to how we

221
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,710
should design and implement these
solutions for real world success.

222
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,720
Now that we have seen what tools and
strategies are available, let's talk

223
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
about how to implement them effectively.

224
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,750
First, begin with the business
client re business requirements.

225
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,430
Start with the business impact
analysis to prioritize what's crucial.

226
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,950
Typically, organizations allocate
eight to 15% of SAP infrastructure

227
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,840
budget towards resilience.

228
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:16,600
Second layer, your defense
protect at every layer.

229
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,810
Infrastructure, database,
and applications.

230
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,835
Multi-layer protection
increases rates to about 92%.

231
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:29,034
Compared to the 63% of
single layer setups.

232
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:35,754
Third, automate where possible
automation speeds up recovery

233
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,344
and reduces human errors.

234
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:45,415
Automation process improves success rate
by 89% versus 62% for manual effort.

235
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:50,514
And finally, test regularly
organizations that perform

236
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:52,524
quarterly recovery drills nearly.

237
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,640
Doubles their success rate during
the actual disaster recovery events

238
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,600
compared to those test once a year.

239
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,290
Ultimately, it's about building the
muscle memory because when a real crisis

240
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,230
hit, practic practice makes resilience.

241
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,790
And finally, after all planning
and preparation, how do we

242
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,650
know if it is truly resilient?

243
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,540
That's where key metrics like
recovery time, objective.

244
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:27,280
And, uh, recovery point
objective comes into play.

245
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:33,550
As we near the end of today's session,
let's focus on how we measure resilience.

246
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,490
There are two critical matrices.

247
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,240
Every organization must define recovery
time, objective, recovery point,

248
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,820
objective, recovery time objective.

249
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:52,209
The maximum acceptable time is to restore
system functionality after disruption.

250
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:58,645
Recovery point objective, the maximum
acceptable amount of data loss measured

251
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,925
in time, but it doesn't stop there.

252
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:06,475
Continuous improvement through
regular testing and refinements is

253
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:09,715
essential to strengthen recovery
cap recovery capabilities.

254
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,280
Organizations that clearly
define Optimizational

255
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,720
Optimizational, these metrices.

256
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,640
Achieve recovery times 42%.

257
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,070
Closer to the business requirement
experience is 58% fewer business

258
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,440
disruptions during recovery operations.

259
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,250
And then on an average recovery,
2.6 times faster, reducing recovery

260
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,670
from 12.3 hours down to 4.7 hours.

261
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,770
As cloud and SAP technology evolves,
mastering R tvOS and R tvOS will be a key.

262
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:53,125
For maintaining competitive advantages
and ensuring true business continuity.

263
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:58,165
And with that, we have completed
our journey through optimization,

264
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,395
uh, high availability and
disaster recovery for SAP systems.

265
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:07,220
Let's move on to wrap up,
uh, today's discussion.

266
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,650
Thank you.
