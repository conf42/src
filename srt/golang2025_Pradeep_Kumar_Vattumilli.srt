00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:27,945
For enabling real time analytics,
even in the most resource

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,085
constrained environments.

9
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,514
What is edge computing?

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:34,885
Edge computing is a proximity
focused processing approach where

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,405
computation occurs directly at
or near data generation points.

12
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:46,015
This dramatically reduces the need
to transfer information to distant,

13
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,205
centralized servers and back again.

14
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,475
It features a low latency architecture.

00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:05,654
safety systems, and real time analytics.

18
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:10,725
Additionally, edge computing distributes
computing power across the network

19
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:17,114
edge, ensuring operation continuity
during connectivity disruptions, and

20
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:21,229
enhancing data privacy by processing
sense to information locally.

21
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:27,100
So let's, look at the practical
applications of H computing in, autonomous

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,609
vehicles, self-driving cars process
estimates of sensor data in milliseconds.

23
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,419
H computing enables, critical split
second edition, making locally, ensuring

24
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,249
safety and, responsiveness regarding

processing for continuous real

27
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,059
time monitoring and analysis.

28
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:58,339
This technology identifies subtle
anomalies, predicts potential, failures,

29
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:02,079
and trigger, provincial maintenance
without relaying on distance.

30
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,279
Centralized systems in healthcare
monitoring advanced variable

31
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:11,589
devices analyze complex patient
vital signs directly on the device.

32
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:15,159
They intelligently process
health data locally.

33
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:21,439
Preserving privacy and battery life
while only transmitting, critical

34
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,725
alerts when potentially life-threatening
pattern image, And, introduction to

35
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:32,975
Tiny ml. Tiny ml. A all throw low

months or years of operations on small.

37
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,534
Batteries or energy harvesting systems.

38
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:45,424
It is ideal for long-term
deployments in, remote environments.

39
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:50,984
Tiny ML dramatically compresses,
neural networks to function within

40
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:54,644
just a kilobyte of memory through
advanced techniques like, quantization,

41
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,314
pruning and, knowledge legislations.

42
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:02,394
It runs on microcontrollers with,
severely constrained resources, one

43
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,135
device interface process data, and,
Make intelligent decisions directly at

44
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:10,765
the source without, cloud dependencies,
eliminating latency, enhancing

45
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:15,505
privacy, and ensuring functionality
even in disconnected environments.

46
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,524
the technical foundation
of, tiny ml, right?

47
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:24,609
So the technical foundation of ML
involves several key components.

48
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:31,269
First, modern optimization techniques
like quantization, pruning, and,

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,070
Knowledge distillations are used
to compress neural networks.

50
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,820
This methods, reduce numerical
ions from 32 bit to eight bit or

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,429
lower while maintaining critical
accuracy thresholds for deployment.

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,989
Second, specialized frameworks like
tensor floor light for microcontrollers.

53
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,219
These, frameworks enable seamless,
deployment on several cons

54
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,769
constrained hardware with a little at.

55
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,809
2 56 KB of flash memory.

56
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:03,299
Third hardware acceleration.

57
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,469
In latest generation microcontrollers

58
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:08,699
ML acceleration hardware.

59
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,909
These purpose build silicone
employment dramatically employ

60
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:18,259
interference speed by up to 10 times
while simultaneously reducing more

61
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,779
conception to the micro world range.

62
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,504
And, tiny ML development
workflow, the tiny ML development.

63
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,669
Workflow consists of four main steps.

64
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,559
First, data collection involves
gathering representative sensor data

65
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,109
that captures all essential edge cases.

66
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:39,359
This meticulously labeled dataset
creates the foundation for robust,

67
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,739
modern, like model performance.

68
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,459
Second model training involves a
development in shell neural networks

69
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,799
using powerful computing infrastructure.

70
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,094
Start with full precision,
architecture before beginning the

71
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:53,294
optimization, gen third optimization.

72
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,869
Transform model through
strategic quantitation pruning

73
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,009
and knowledge distillations.

74
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,629
This, critical phase reduces
modern requirement like, memory

75
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,969
requirement, to me kilobytes while

readiness and the synergy.

80
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,190
Okay.

81
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,320
Edge computing and tiny ml
combining edge computing and

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,080
tiny ml offers several benefits.

83
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,360
Enhanced privacy is achieved
since to data remains on device.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,170
Eliminating cloud secu, security
vulnerabilities and ensuring regulatory

85
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,640
complaints reduced latency is another
advantage with sub millisecond re.

86
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,710

00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:10,675
accelerations, and optimized models
extending battery life or harvest

92
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:13,195
two months for I OT deployments.

93
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:14,115
Applic.

94
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,640
Applications across industries.

95
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,540
Each computing and tiny ml have
applications across various industries.

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,280
In healthcare, intelligent monitoring
device detects, critical patient

97
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,229
anomalies in, real time on device
algorithms enable instantaneous,

98
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,919
failed detection and lifesaving,
recognition without cloud connectivity

99
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,959
in agriculture, precision field sensors

100
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,739
nutrition levels, and Camera conditions.

101
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,239
Automated irrigation systems
dramatically responds to environmental

102
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:50,149
changes, optimizing water usage
and crop fields In manufacturing,

103
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,139
advanced equipment monitors, utilize
vibration and acoustic signatures

104
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,079
to identify subtle failure patterns.

105
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,819
Data-driven pre predictive maintenance
algorithms prevent catastrophic

106
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:07,484
breakdowns, reducing downturn by
up to 70% in the consumer sector.

107
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:13,764
Sophisticated variables recognize complex
activities and health patterns with

108
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:19,854
medical grade accuracy, energy efficient
voice interference, understand natural

109
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:24,434
language commands, and maintaining
privacy by processing all data locally.

110
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:29,684
So with this, we have implementation
challenges as well, implementing

111
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,534
each computing and time comes
with several challenges.

112
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:38,234
Resource constraints are significant
issue with extreme limitations in memory

113
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:41,444
and processing power and energy capacity.

114
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:45,314
Restricting model complexity and
functionality model accuracy is another

115
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:50,234
challenge as balancing performance
State ops while maintaining acceptable

116
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:54,585
interference accuracy during aggressive
optimization process can be difficult.

117
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,139
Development complexity

118
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,899
in embedded systems Modern.

119
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:05,034
Magician and hardware specific
implementation techniques.

120
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:11,144
Security concerns are also prevent as
v vulnerable H device devices faces

121
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:16,394
increase risk where ADV attacks and
modern theft and privacy breaches

122
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,184
requiring robust protection mechanism.

123
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,764
So let's compare the technologies.

124
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:26,354
So we have cloud computing,
edge computing, and tiny.

125
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:31,004
Cloud computing process data in remote
data centers with latency ranging from

126
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,444
a hundred milliseconds, two seconds.

127
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:36,784
High power requirements in kilowatts,
constant connectivity needed, and a

128
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,975
typical memory in gigabytes or more
each computing process, data in local

129
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:45,925
gateways or servers with latencies
ranging from 10 to hundred milliseconds.

130
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,855
Moderate power requirements in wats,
intermediate connectivity needed

131
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,865
and difficult memory in megabytes.

132
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:53,155
Tiny ML process data.

133
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:58,885
On end devices with latency ranging
from one to 10 milliseconds, low

134
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:03,175
power requirements in milliwatts,
minimal or no connectivity needed,

135
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,605
and typical memory in kilobytes.

136
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,665
And let's see the future of
the edge, intelligence here.

137
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,625
So it includes several exciting trends.

138
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:15,675
Federated learning is a distributed
training architecture that enable

139
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:18,945
devices to collectively improve
models while presuming data.

140
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,775
Privacy and sovereignty.

141
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,365
Neuromorphic computing involves
biologically inspired process

142
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:31,005
architectures that mimic neurostructures
for unprecedented energy efficiency.

143
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:35,195
In ML workloads, energy harvesting
involves autonomous ml. Systems

144
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:39,785
that capture ambient energy from
surroundings enable perpetual

145
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:42,635
influence without battery replacements.

146
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:46,955
Tiny transformations are radically
compressed attention based.

147
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:51,245
That bring sophisticated language
