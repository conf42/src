1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,025
My name is K, and I will be
presenting on healthcare.

2
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:04,834
Im probability.

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:07,465
I would like to start
with a simple question.

4
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:12,234
What happens when patient arrives
in an emergency room and their

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,575
medical history isn't accessible?

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,714
Too often doctors have to make decisions
without knowing about prior allergies.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,490
As results or treatments.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,940
This isn't an IT challenge, it's a
human challenge, and this is exactly

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,030
what healthcare interoperability is
about, ensuring the right data reaches

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,945
the right hands at the right time.

11
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:43,410
So today I'll walk you through
on how platform engineering

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,519
principles can help us solve
these interoperability challenges.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,210
We'll cover the complexity of healthcare
data exchange, the architecture

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,110
we use to address the exchange.

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,050
How can the new cloud native and
AI powered solution help some

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,180
of the real world case studies?

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,400
And by the end, I hope to show you how
engineering choices directly translates

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,500
into improved patient outcomes.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,600
The healthcare interoperability challenge,
healthcare data is fragmented, spread

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,440
across legacy EHRs, lab, imaging
systems, even personal applications.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,720
Traditional point to point
can't keep up the scale.

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,300
Data formats vary.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,520
Now, there are certain HL
seven fire custom schemas.

24
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:42,580
There is a high security and
compliance demand and solution

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,140
needs to scale from small clinics
to massive regional networks.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,295
And when systems don't talk to
each other, patients pay the price.

27
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:53,345
We have.

28
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:59,180
A lot of challenges with respect
to having an emergency treatment

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,799
without any prior history.

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,680
There is a fragmented care in
care coordinations that there are

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,730
duplicate test because the test and
the priorit test information are

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,900
not available for the doctors to
provide the right care at the right.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,180
So in order to address this, we
have a platform architecture for

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,550
healthcare data exchange, which is
a multi-layered architecture that

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,135
separates the concerns while providing
flexible integration capabilities.

36
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:39,305
Data ingestion layer handles connections
to diverse healthcare systems.

37
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,335
Through standardized connectors.

38
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:48,715
Data transformation helps to normalize
formats and also with the increasing AI

39
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:55,135
capability, this can, the mappings can
be achieved in a short period of time.

40
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:59,915
Orchestration layer basically will help
with validation of the business rules.

41
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,895
No consent if there are any,
and any conflict resolution.

42
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:08,445
The last but not least, the
application interface layer is

43
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:15,705
primarily providing access to this
information using FHIR compliant

44
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:19,125
APIs that applications can rely on.

45
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,635
This isn't just a technology stack.

46
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:28,715
It's about making sure that when a
specialist, a family doctor, and an ER

47
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:31,805
physician, all treat the same patient.

48
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,445
They are not working in silos.

49
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:39,275
They are looking at the same information
about the patient and providing

50
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,285
the right care that is required.

51
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:45,565
There are also cloud native
strategies that we can apply,

52
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:50,895
and this gives us agility in the
healthcare that is desperately needed.

53
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:56,145
Microservices and Kubernetes basically
can help from a scalability aspect.

54
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:59,505
Serverless computing
for variable workloads,

55
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:06,725
container ization, and also infrastructure
as a code for consistency and compliance.

56
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:12,345
And obviously as we move to cloud,
there are also an AI enhanced data

57
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,535
mapping and transformations, so ai.

58
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:20,285
In itself can significantly
reduce the complexity and cost of

59
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:22,595
implementing interoperability solution.

60
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:27,755
Traditionally, mapping requires a
lot of manual effort to identify

61
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,445
the relationship between different
data schemas and develop rules.

62
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:37,705
There are a lot of medicine learning
algorithms and NLP that can help with.

63
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:43,695
The matching semantic matching for the
mapping purposes, and also the NLPs

64
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:49,085
are widely available to translate the
free text clinical documentation and

65
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:55,025
providing the ability to search and
provide analytics on the documentation.

66
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:55,775
Under the notes

67
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,770
in this section I cover.

68
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,200
Briefly about security and compliance
architecture, of course, in

69
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
healthcare security isn't optional.

70
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,680
It has to be integrated
part of the solution.

71
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,370
So we implement federal identity and
single sign on there is always fine grain

72
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,050
authorization, which is provided by role
because different types of healthcare

73
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,860
providers require access to different
categories of patient information

74
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,650
based on their role in patient care.

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,800
Emergency physicians may need broader
access or specialties, require only

76
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,840
access to the relevant information.

77
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,840
The data has to be encrypted,
end to end in the solution

78
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,060
from transmission and storage.

79
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,060
Even if intermediate systems are
compromised, the data provides

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,570
automated rotation and secure
distribution of encryption keys.

81
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,750
That is a comprehensive audit.

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,970
Logging capture all data access and
modification activities to support

83
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,800
compliance, reporting, and secure
monitoring Generates detailed

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,060
records without manual intervention,
while providing real-time alerts

85
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,490
from suspicious action pattern.

86
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,930
This isn't about compliance,
it's about trust.

87
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:16,380
Trust between providers,
and most importantly, trust.

88
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,315
With patients.

89
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:22,205
These are some of the real world
implementation case studies that

90
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,360
I would like to walk through

91
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,840
a regional health information exchange.

92
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,000
Basically, HIEs are the organization
which connect hundreds of providers

93
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,440
now gives ER doctors access
to critical patient histories.

94
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:41,875
In minutes and seconds, there are
multiple hospital consolidation effort.

95
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:46,855
Used this approach to migrate system
gradually without disrupting care

96
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:53,395
and obviously patient facing apps
built on smart using fire APIs

97
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:58,405
and giving individuals control
over their complete health record.

98
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:04,205
Obviously while we have all of this that
has to be monitoring and observability

99
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:09,425
strategies that has to be aligned
with all of the implementation.

100
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:15,975
So talking through this while we have the
fire APIs, the application performance

101
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,015
monitoring tracks API response time.

102
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:22,545
Data transformation throughput
and system resource utilization.

103
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,865
Automated alerting ensures
immediate notification when

104
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,395
metrics exceeds threshold.

105
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,905
Data flow monitoring ensures
information moves through

106
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,335
information pipelines as expected.

107
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:40,665
It tracks messages, processing rates,
success rates, and end 20 de latency.

108
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:46,275
There's also an error in tracking analysis
which has, which is done comprehensively.

109
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:52,085
To ensure if there is an anomaly
detected within the data that has

110
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:53,795
been tracked and resolved in it

111
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,705
while we build the solution.

112
00:07:55,705 --> 00:08:00,415
We also need to ensure that the
deployments are automated and there are

113
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,120
best DevOps practices that are adapt.

114
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,630
So healthcare and interoperable platform
benefits significantly from this

115
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,030
automated deployment practices that
reduce human error and enabling consistent

116
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,660
repeatable deployments across different.

117
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,720
The complexity of healthcare integration
solution makes manual deployment

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,060
processes error prone and difficult
to maintain as systems evolve.

119
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:32,625
Automated deployment pipelines ensures
that changes are deployed consistently

120
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:38,175
by also providing rollback capabilities
if there are any issues discovered.

121
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,335
So while we talk through.

122
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:46,405
The deployment, obviously from an
operationalization, what comes as the

123
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:52,705
performance optimization and scalability,
so as healthcare interpreter platform

124
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:58,635
handle significant data volumes,
transaction rates, while meeting response

125
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,195
times suitable for clinical workflows.

126
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,755
So we want to make sure the
data processing is optimized.

127
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,850
Efficient.

128
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,780
Transformational algorithms
minimize computational resources

129
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,160
while maintaining accuracy.

130
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,670
There are also able to handle
parallel processing approaches for

131
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,260
the increasing data volume need.

132
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,560
There are also intelligent caching
strategies to ensure that the same or the

133
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,730
similar set of data is cached within the
system and is not processed repetitively.

134
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,980
Database partitioning, indexing strategies
and query optimization enables platforms

135
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,470
to maintain, perform while accommodating
growing data requirement and historical

136
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,080
data that must remain accessible.

137
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,020
Load balancing and auto-scaling
ensures that perform platforms can

138
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,210
handle variable demand pattern while
maintaining cost efficiency, auto-scaling

139
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,700
algorithms, and just computing resources.

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,350
Based on demand while ensuring
capacity for traffic spike.

141
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,960
So where are we headed
from a future perspective?

142
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,930
Obviously there are blockchain concepts
that can be used in healthcare to

143
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,510
ensure there's a tamper proof audit
and patient control data sharing.

144
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:25,555
Through challenges around performance,
scalability, and compliance remain.

145
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:32,605
There are advanced AI capabilities using
LLMs that show promise of improving

146
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,955
clinical documentation processing,
and I'm enabling more sophisticated

147
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,325
and natural language interfaces.

148
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:44,255
So while closing, let's remember,
interoperability isn't just about

149
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,905
system talking to each other.

150
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:52,370
It's about ensuring people, patient,
doctor, nurses, have what they need

151
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,590
to make the best possible decision.

152
00:10:55,445 --> 00:11:00,875
If we as engineers, architects, and
innovators can design platforms that

153
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:05,075
connect these dots, then we are not
just solving a technical challenge,

154
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:11,585
we are improving care, reducing cost,
and in some cases even saving lives.

155
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:12,845
Thank you.

156
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,045
A good.
