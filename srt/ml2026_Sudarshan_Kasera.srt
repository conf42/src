1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,640
Speaker 31: Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,080
Thank you for being here today.

3
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:09,170
My name is Han Kasra and I'm a structural
engineer with over 10 years of experience

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,290
in the telecommunications tower industry.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,530
Today, I want to share how we can
leverage data analytics to fundamentally

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,580
improve the way we approach
structural analysis of telecom towers.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,709
This presentation will cover the
structural engineering fundamentals.

8
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:31,005
That underpin tower analysis and design,
and then show you where data-driven

9
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:36,315
methods can add tremendous value to
this traditionally manual process.

10
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,825
Whether you are from the tech
side or the infrastructure side,

11
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:44,834
my goal is to somewhat bridge two
more, bridge these two worlds and

12
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,265
show the opportunity ahead of us.

13
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,495
Load demands on towers is
increasing due to network

14
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,595
upgrade requirements such as 5G.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,610
Equipment is getting larger and heavier
while the overall infrastructure is aging.

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,550
Many towers in the US were originally
designed in the 1980s and nineties

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,039
for much lighter anti antenna loads.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,620
The average structural load on existing
towers has grown significantly with

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,960
each generation of wireless technology.

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,170
From two G to 5G, the Tower infrastructure
market continues to expand through

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,120
2030, driven by densification
and rural broadband initiatives.

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,420
Continuous uptime is no longer a luxury.

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,130
It is a critical requirement.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,820
It tower supports public safety,
communications, emergency services,

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,470
and essential connectivity.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,660
It becomes critical.

27
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:46,609
That structural analysis accurately
captures all tower components to

28
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,799
maintain continuous network uptime.

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,390
This is where data analytics
can play a transformative role.

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,510
Before we talk about analytics, it is
important to understand the engineering

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,325
standards foundation that governs
everything we do in tower structure.

32
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,190
Analysis.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,400
The International Building Code or IBC
is the overarching legal code adopted by

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,070
most jurisdictions in the United States.

35
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,450
It serves as the umbrella under
which all understands operate.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,570
N-C-T-I-A 2 2 2 is the primary
standards specifically developed

37
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,520
for Antia supporting structures.

38
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,770
It covers towers types, including
self-support towers, monopole, kite

39
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,500
towers, and any other infrastructure
supporting wireless equipments.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,900
The current revision of
the code is revision.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,720
IASC seven provides the foundational
and environmental loads including wind

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,450
speed maps, ice loading criteria, seismic
parameters, and their load combinations.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,690
TIA 2 22 references A SCE seven
and adapts its provisions for

44
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,460
tower specific applications.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,320
A ISC 360 governs the design of structural
steel members and connections since

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,760
the vast majority of telecom towers
are steel structures, this standard is

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,100
critical for member capacity checks.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,700
A CI 3 1 8 covers reinforced concrete
design as an and is essential

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,720
for Tower Foundation design.

50
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,445
Including drill shafts, spread
fittings and MAT foundations.

51
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:23,525
These standards form an
integrated framework.

52
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:27,785
When we talk about automating or
applying analytics to structural

53
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:32,790
analysis, we must ensure full
compliance with this code hierarchy.

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,775
This slides covers the critical
load types that every tower

55
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,335
must be designed to resist.

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,670
Understanding these loads is
essential because they are the core

57
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,080
inputs to any structural model,
whether traditional or data driven.

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,510
Dead loads include the self weight of
the tower, steel platforms, ladders,

59
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,090
an antenna, mounts, and all mounted
equipment such as an antennas, radios,

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,310
junction boxes, and feed lines.

61
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,540
Accurate.

62
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,010
Dead load accounting is fundamental
and is an area where data analytics

63
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,110
can significantly reduce errors.

64
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,690
And equipment inventory wind
loads are typically the governing

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,520
load for most telecom towers.

66
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,130
We calculate velocity pressure based
on the basic wind speed from a SE seven

67
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,830
wind maps adjusted for exposure category,
topographic effects and height above,

68
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,710
crown the wind loads and an antennas
and appurtenances can exceed the wind

69
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,630
load on the tower Structural itself.

70
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:38,025
Ice load is critical in
some certain climates.

71
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:43,185
Tia 2, 2 2 specifies radial ice
thicknesses, maps and towers must

72
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:47,565
be analyzed for ice weight plus
concurrent reduced wind loads.

73
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,975
ICE can dramatically increase
the effective projected area

74
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,445
of members and an antennas.

75
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:57,515
Seismic loads are evaluated based
on site classification, map,

76
00:04:57,515 --> 00:05:01,355
spectral acceleration, and the
response modification factors.

77
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,750
For the tower type, while wind
typically governs tower design,

78
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,070
seismic loads can control foundation
design in high seismic zones.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,510
Thermal effects, while sometimes
overlooked, can introduce significant

80
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,420
stresses in constraint members, especially
in guide towers and long monopole sections

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,925
with large temperature differentials.

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,670
The key point for this audience is
that each of these load types generate

83
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,010
large volume of site specific data.

84
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:37,175
Structuring and analyzing this data
at scale is where machine learning

85
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,725
and analytics begins to add value.

86
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:45,055
Modern structural analysis software
such as STA Reset Tower and TNX has

87
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:49,825
significantly advanced our ability
to perform detailed finite element

88
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,165
analysis on tower structures.

89
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:56,500
These platforms automate the application
of hundreds of load combinations.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,210
Excuse me, required by TI 2 22
and a SE seven and perform member

91
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,130
by member design checks against
a ISC 360 capacity equations.

92
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,600
This alone has dramatically
reduced analysis turnaround time

93
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,580
compared to hand calculations.

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,215
Documentation and reporting is arguably
the most important deliverable in an

95
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,345
in any structural engineering project.

96
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,530
The structure analysis report
along with seal drawings is

97
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,580
what gets submitted to the local
jurisdiction for a building permit.

98
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,650
Without a permit, no construction or
modification can proceed at the site.

99
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,070
Standardized reporting formats that meet
regulatory requirement are essential

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
to obtaining permits efficiently.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Tower operators in the US own anywhere
from hundreds to over 40,000 towers.

102
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,040
For operators at that scale.

103
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,470
Centralized data integration is critical,
accurate, and clean data can reduce the

104
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,200
time spent on each tower analysis cycle
and also accelerate troubleshooting for

105
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,750
maintenance related structural issues.

106
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,280
This is where we start to see the
conversions of traditional engineering

107
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,260
softwares with data platforms
when analysis results are strode.

108
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,140
In structural databases, rather than
isolated PDF reports, we unlock the

109
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,140
ability to perform portfolio wide,
trend analysis and predictive insights.

110
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,530
High quality data is the foundation
of any analytics or machine learning

111
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,230
initiative and structural engineering.

112
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,460
For telecom towers.

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,800
The key data inputs come from multiple
sources that must be integrated.

114
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,020
Structural data sets include material
properties such as steel grade

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,330
yield, strength, member dimensions,
including leg sizes, bracing patterns,

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,640
pole sizes, connection details,
foundation specifications, et cetera.

117
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,270
These are the building blocks
of any structural model.

118
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,430
Stress ratios or demand to
capacity ratios are the primary

119
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,500
output of structural analysis.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,270
Tracking stress ratios across all members
and across multiple analysis runs provide

121
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,340
a rich data set for identifying trends.

122
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,070
Similarly, deflection data can include
historical displacement measurements,

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,440
service serviceability, limit checks,
and dynamic response characteristics,

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,370
such as natural frequency and
vortex setting susceptibility.

125
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,470
Inspection records capture
field conditions, that

126
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,060
model alone cannot predict.

127
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,770
Corrosion progression,
connection loosening, foundation

128
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,230
cracking, and any member damage.

129
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,300
When digitized and standardized
inspection data can become a powerful

130
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,420
input for predictive maintenance models.

131
00:08:54,395 --> 00:09:00,125
Key message here is that each of these
data streams independently ha has value,

132
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:06,215
but when combined and structured, they
enable a level of insight that was

133
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:08,975
previously impossible in our industry.

134
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:12,915
This slide illustrates the ELU evaluation
from traditional structural analysis.

135
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:14,699
To where we want to go.

136
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,199
That is intelligence driven.

137
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,460
Infrastructure management.

138
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,650
Think of it as a maturity curve.

139
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,430
On the left, we start with
traditional structural analysis.

140
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,390
This is the code based, standard
driven approach that has been the

141
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,160
backbone of the industry for decades.

142
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,470
It works well, but is inherently
reactive and project specific.

143
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,269
The next step is digital modeling,
where we move from 2D drawings and

144
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,069
static reports to full 3D finite
element models that can be updated

145
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,349
and reanalyzed as condition change.

146
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,769
This is where I feel we are at today.

147
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,009
Data integration is the
critical middle step.

148
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,089
This is where we connect analysis
results, inspection records,

149
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,670
environmental data, and equipment
inventories into a unified data platform.

150
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,790
Without this step analysis,
analytics, and machine learning

151
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,930
have nothing to work with.

152
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,390
Analytics then allows us to query
these integrated data for trends,

153
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,829
which towers in our portfolio have
the highest stress ratios, which

154
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,959
reasons so accelerated corrosion.

155
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,270
Finally, predictive analysis.

156
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:24,650
This is where we want to be.

157
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:29,449
Predictive analysis can use machine
learning to move from descriptive

158
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,640
insights to forward-looking predictions.

159
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:36,814
Instead of asking what happened, we
can ask what is likely to happen and

160
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:42,055
when each stage builds on the one
before it, you cannot skip straight to

161
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:46,885
machine learning without first having
structured high quality engineering data.

162
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,635
This is a message I want to
emphasize to the tech community.

163
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,360
The engineering fundamentals
must come first.

164
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,329
Let us talk about the tangible business
impact of adopting a data centric

165
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,339
approach to structural engineering.

166
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,660
Extended surface life is perhaps
the most significant benefit.

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,750
Proactive monitoring and data driven
maintenance decisions can extend a

168
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,470
towers operational life well beyond its
original 25 to 30 year design expectation.

169
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:21,760
Given that a new tower bill can cost
several hundred thousand dollars.

170
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:26,245
Extending the life of existing
assets by even five to 10 years

171
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,735
represent enormous capital savings.

172
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,485
Reduced liability is
critical in our industry.

173
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:37,584
Comprehensive documentations and
consistent analysis protocols provide

174
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:43,765
strong defensibility in regulatory audits
and legal context when every analysis

175
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:48,985
decision is traceable and every inspection
finding recorded in a structured database.

176
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:53,305
The operator's risk exposure,
it's significantly reduced.

177
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:58,845
Proactive decision making is enabled
when analytics ready reported reaches

178
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:03,735
leadership teams instead of reactive
capital expenditure driven by emergencies

179
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:09,225
or permit deadlines, executives can
make informed capital allocation and

180
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:14,375
risk management decisions based on
portfolio-wide data, this business

181
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,570
outcome, these business outcomes.

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,680
Represent real revenue and
cost optimization opportunities

183
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,940
to wrap up the future of resilient
telecommunications infrastructure lies at

184
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,610
a cover convergence of four key elements.

185
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,990
Traditional engineering provides
the standards based analysis and

186
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,700
proven design methodologies that
ensure safety and code compliance.

187
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,340
This foundation is non-negotiable and must
remain at the core of everything we do.

188
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,310
Structured data transforms,
isolated analysis reports and

189
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,280
inspection findings into queryable
analyzable data sets that this is

190
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,780
the enabler that bridges traditional
engineering with modern technology.

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,510
Machine learning takes structured
data and builds predictive models

192
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,920
and intelligent monitoring systems
that can identify patterns.

193
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,110
Human would miss across thousands of
towers and millions of data points.

194
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,050
The end result is resilient networks,
safer infrastructure that supports the

195
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,600
critical communications our society
depends on, manage more efficiently and

196
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,760
with greater confidence than ever before.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
One message I want to emphasize
in all this, the engineering

198
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,080
fundamentals must come first.

199
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,670
