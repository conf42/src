1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello everyone and thank
you for joining today.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,480
Today I'll be presenting on
harnessing AI for autonomous threat

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,310
defense in multi-cloud security.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,860
My name is Pip Kura.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,410
I'm principal architect at Trace three.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,119
Today we will explore how artificial
intelligence is transforming security

7
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:27,369
in multi-cloud environments, helping
us defend against increasingly

8
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:29,020
sophisticated cyber threats.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,470
Let's begin by acknowledging
the reality we are facing today.

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,580
In cybersecurity, the threats
aren't what they used to be.

11
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:45,819
Legacy security frameworks, things
like basic firewalls, VPNs and

12
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:47,410
intuition detection systems.

13
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,089
These were designed for a old
where threats were simpler,

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,910
slower, and frankly easier to spot.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Today's threats are incredibly dynamic.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,770
We are seeing polymorphic malware that
changes its code every time it executes.

17
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,970
We are facing advanced persistent
threats, attackers that sit quietly

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,280
inside networks for months learning,
adapting, avoiding detection.

19
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:23,604
And let's be clear, these not the
work of random hackers anymore.

20
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:30,655
It's highly organized, often state
sponsored, and increasingly automated.

21
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,565
Machine learning is now used by
attackers themselves to develop

22
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,935
smarter, faster exploits.

23
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,664
One of the biggest problems, isn't it?

24
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:44,335
The gap between.

25
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:48,940
When an exploit is created and
when it's launched, it's shrinking.

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,769
Organizations barely have time
to patch these vulnerabilities

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,350
before attack a strike.

28
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,630
The old models of detect,
done, respond are too slow.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,570
We need a fundamentally new approach,
and that's where AI begins to shed.

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,989
And now let's talk about
the AI security advantage.

31
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:18,155
AI brings three, transform two
capabilities to cybersecurity, and it's

32
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,885
important to understand them individually.

33
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:25,295
For the first, let's talk
about real time analysis.

34
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:31,295
We all know AI can process
petabytes of security data such

35
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:35,674
as logs, network traffic, user
behaviors within milliseconds.

36
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:40,295
It's like giving your security
operations team a super human vision.

37
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:48,815
Patterns that would take a human analyst
days to recognize or surfaced instantly.

38
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,885
Second is autonomous response.

39
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,955
Historically, once an alert was
raised, humans had to analyze,

40
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:04,385
validate, escalate, and finally
act that takes hovers or longer.

41
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:10,265
In the meantime, the attacker is
moving, stealing, and damaging the.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,320
Enterprise Now, AI flips This.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,200
Systems now detect threats and
immediately act by isolating, infected

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,030
missions, shutting down dangerous
processes often without needing a

45
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:33,019
human to approve it First, third,
and perhaps more most exciting is

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,010
adapt to defense AI based systems or
self-learning every attack they see.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,640
Every anomaly they process
makes them smarter.

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,510
They evolve alongside attackers.

49
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:54,230
Traditional signature based defenses,
a static AI based defenses are alive

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,940
and growing stronger every day.

51
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,405
When we talk about measurable improvements
using ai, we are talking about operational

52
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,955
realities, not theoretical pro promises.

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,940
Think about false positives.

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,130
In many organizations, security
teams are drowning in alerts.

55
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:22,080
90% of those alerts, they're just noise
by reducing false positives by 30%.

56
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,200
AI doesn't just make teams more efficient.

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,245
It helps them focus on the right
threads faster with less burnout.

58
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,010
Response times are cut by 50%.

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,250
Means incident that used to take six hours
to mitigate now takes under three minutes.

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,030
In cybersecurity, speed is everything.

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,940
Every second, an attacker remains
inside your network, increases damage

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,350
exponentially and a 40% faster.

63
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,070
Incident resolution rate reduces
not just the duration of attacks.

64
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:04,875
But also their downstream costs,
like regulatory fines, lost

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,485
customer trust and recovery efforts.

66
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:13,155
These numbers translate into real
business value, not just better

67
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:15,825
security, but stronger bottom lines.

68
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:21,945
Now let's talk about AI
powered behavioral tactics.

69
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:26,530
Traditional security often relies
on static rules, for example.

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,720
If X happens or Y happens, block it.

71
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:36,030
The problem is attacker knows the these
rules and they find ways around them.

72
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,580
But now let's see it.

73
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,059
The ai, it takes a different approach.

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
AI watches it and learns from it.

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,299
It knows what normal looks like,
not based on rigid definitions, but

76
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,700
based on continuous observation.

77
00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:00,030
For instance, or for example, if a user
always logs in from Austin, between

78
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,080
9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and generally
there's a login from Singapore at

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,270
midnight that's flagged immediately.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,975
Or for instance, if a database starts
sending unusually large amounts of sense

81
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:19,375
to data outside normal business hours,
AI detects that and crucially, it doesn't

82
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,335
just flag anomaly, it takes action.

83
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:28,095
It takes action by automatically
locking those suspicious accounts or

84
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,824
isolating those suspicious devices.

85
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:36,645
A prevents minor anomalies
from becoming major incidents.

86
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,145
Let's talk about zero
trust implementation.

87
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,914
I believe this as being has
become a buzzword, but it's

88
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,174
also a fundamental principle.

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,480
It's like never trust, always verify.

90
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
That's zero trust implementation, right?

91
00:06:54,809 --> 00:07:00,960
So we can no longer assume that because a
device is inside our network, it is safe.

92
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,390
We must verify everything like
every user, every device, every

93
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,210
access request least privilege means
thinking critically about access.

94
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:17,055
Does this really, does this user really
need database segment privileges,

95
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:19,784
or can they just read reports?

96
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:26,175
And assuming breaches means building
layer defenses like microsegmentation.

97
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,795
Microsegmentation is nothing but
dividing the networks in enterprise into

98
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:35,175
smaller zones, which limits that blast
radius if an attacker breaks through.

99
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:40,335
Now with ai, it enhances
zero trust strategies by

100
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,880
monitoring trust continuously.

101
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,335
Not just at the moment of login,
but during the entire session.

102
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:51,685
Let's talk about AI
integration security platforms.

103
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:57,235
AI enhances existing security
platforms within multi-cloud.

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,565
Think about a typical SIM platform.

105
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:06,685
S sim means security, informa
information and event management.

106
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:12,685
Traditionally what it does is it
aggregates logs, normalizes data and

107
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:15,325
triggers alerts based on rule sets.

108
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,895
But when you add ai,
something powerful happens.

109
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:25,135
AI can correlate security events
across systems automatically.

110
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:31,525
For example, it might see a strange
authentication attempt in Azure active.

111
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:38,125
Which correlates with abnormal API calls
that is happening in AWS cloud, and

112
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,755
tie that to a such specious download
that happens in a GitHub report.

113
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,295
Certainly what looked
like isolated events.

114
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,665
Now tell the story of
a coordinated attack.

115
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:53,755
Similarly in so platforms, which is
security orchestration, automation and

116
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:59,875
response platforms, AI helps automate
this instance of handling these workflows.

117
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:05,995
Now for the Imagine This, a
phishing email is de detected.

118
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,155
AI automatically quarantine.

119
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:12,444
The email locks affected user
account flags, similar emails,

120
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,935
and notify security analysts.

121
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,975
All within seconds.

122
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:17,815
Time is the key.

123
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,855
And this all comes with no
manual ticket triage, no waiting

124
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,625
hours for investigation it.

125
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:28,345
This is fast orchestrated
with intelligent action.

126
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:34,885
And finally, AI enriches alerts
with contextual intelligence.

127
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:40,194
Instead of just saying anomaly predicted,
the alert might include more details.

128
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:46,675
For example, this credential matches
known tactics, techniques, and

129
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:49,075
procedures of the advanced threat groups.

130
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:52,795
For example, like a PT 29 and.

131
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:57,895
Qualifies them as medium
severity, or it would even take

132
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,635
immediate action as recommended.

133
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:07,105
This kind of context reduces guesswork for
analysts and accelerates time to action.

134
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:10,205
Now, let's talk about task platforms.

135
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:16,595
Cloud security as organizations
expand across AWS, Azure, GCP,

136
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,360
and multi-cloud environments,
and even in hybrid environments.

137
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,360
The complexity of managing security growth
exponentially, there is no longer a single

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,750
perimeter to defend your applications.

139
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,810
Data APIs and users are scattered, are
across dozens of services and providers.

140
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,345
Thankfully, these major cloud
platforms have begun integrating

141
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,425
AI into the security ecosystems.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,550
In AWS services like Guardian
AI continuously scan cloud trail

143
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,740
logs for unusual API activity.

144
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,010
Imagine detecting an administrative
API call happening at 2:00 AM from a

145
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,905
country where you have no employees.

146
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,770
In Azure, the security center uses
mission learning to a assess these

147
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,730
vulnerabilities across compute,
storage and identity services.

148
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,650
Which predicts potential breach points
before attackers can exploit them in

149
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,900
Google Cloud Security Command Center
applies a two and more importantly,

150
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,360
to monitor containerized workloads.

151
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,460
Given the rise of Kubernetes and
microservices, protecting containers

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,460
which are dynamic and affirm is critical.

153
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,460
Now what all ties all
this together is that YAP.

154
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,860
AI operates at cloud speed analyzing
millions of data points across

155
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,950
platforms that would or own human teams.

156
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,760
When security is consistent, automated
and intelligent across clouds, it allows

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,795
organizations to innovate confidently
without sacrificing risk management.

158
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,200
Yes.

159
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,850
Let's bring this all to life
with real world examples.

160
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,310
Financial services are high value
target for attackers, as we all know,

161
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,890
especially with the rise of FinTech.

162
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,110
But now with FIN FinTech companies,
banks can now deploy ea not just for

163
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,650
fraud detection post-transaction,
but to prevent fraudulent

164
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,720
authentication before it even succeed.

165
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,840
For instance, one of the major
institution implemented AI powered

166
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,000
authentication, anomaly detection,
which prevented them over 4.3 million

167
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,130
in losses in just in a single quarter.

168
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,660
Think about the ripple effect,
not just money sale, but

169
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,370
brand and trust are preserved.

170
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,400
Similarly in healthcare faces different
but equally critical challenges.

171
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:58,795
Patient data is among the most
sensitive information in the world

172
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,195
protected by regulations like hipaa.

173
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:09,895
Hospitals now use AI to monitor network
traffic for ransomware behavior patterns.

174
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:16,315
The moment AI detects later movement
or encryption behaviors associated with

175
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:21,865
this ransomware, it isolates affected
endpoints automatically sometime

176
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:24,175
before the ransomware fully executes.

177
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:30,310
And in e-commerce companies
face relentless DDoS attacks,

178
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,830
especially during peak season, like
holidays or major holiday sales.

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,750
Using AI, they can analyze
real time traffic patterns to

180
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,860
distinct use legitimate customers
from board driven traffic.

181
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,770
This allows them to mitigate attacks
without disrupting real shoppers.

182
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:55,614
Maintaining revenue flow, and also most
importantly, the customer satisfaction.

183
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,954
So where are we headed?

184
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,374
What does the future of
cybersecurity looks like?

185
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:10,555
When AI takes center stitch, one major
shift is towards brick two Defense.

186
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,310
Rather than just reacting to threats
and that have already materialized,

187
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,370
future AI systems will anticipate attack
patterns based on early signals such

188
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,989
as subtle network behaviors, metadata
anomalies, or threat intelligence.

189
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:33,339
From around the globe, AI will model the
most likely paths an attacker would take

190
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,079
and proactively close the vulnerabilities
before exploitation happens.

191
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,495
We'll also see more
self-healing infrastructures.

192
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:48,625
Imagine systems that upon detecting
compromise, automatically roll back

193
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:53,245
to a secure snapshot or reconfigure
themselves to eliminate infection

194
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,855
vectors without even human intervention.

195
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:01,675
Finally, with growing compute,
quantum computing maturity,

196
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,959
traditional encryption algorithms
will be increasingly vulnerable.

197
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,599
Yay will be critical in managing
adaptive quantum resistant encryption

198
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:16,630
strategies, evolving defenses in real
time based on quantum threat levels.

199
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,400
It's not just about detecting and
responding anymore, it's about

200
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,135
preempt strengthening defenses
faster than advisories can adapt to.

201
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,675
To wrap up, let's review the key
takeaways from today's session.

202
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:31,185
First.

203
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,110
AI is not optional anymore.

204
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,880
The scale, speed, and sophistication
of modern threats require

205
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,770
defenses that are equally dynamic.

206
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,190
Second, the results are measurable.

207
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,510
Organizations that integrate AI seek
quantifiable improvements in reduced

208
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,940
false postures, faster detection, faster
response, and lower breach impact.

209
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,960
Third you to start your
journey strategically.

210
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,190
Begin with AI enhanced
monitoring and instant detection.

211
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,310
Build muzzle there.

212
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,350
Then gradually move forward towards
fully autonomous response capabilities,

213
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,260
and finally, invest in your people.

214
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,660
AI is not a magic box.

215
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,900
It's a force multiplier for
skilled security professionals.

216
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,950
Develop teams that can
work symbiotically with ai.

217
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,650
Analyzing complex situations, providing
ethical oversight and refining

218
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,080
AI models with domain expertise.

219
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,090
Together, AI and human intelligence
are the future of cybersecurity.

220
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,210
Thank you again for
spending time with me today.

221
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,810
I'm excited about the feature
and I hope you are too.

222
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,680
Thank you.
