1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,929
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,420
this is Mohi with 17 years
of experience in IT industry.

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,599
today I'm gonna talk about
OCR technology and how it is

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,890
considered as the cornerstone of
modern intelligent automation.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,049
let's start with what is O-C-R-O-C-R, also
known as optical character recognition.

6
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:24,520
Is a technology that converts
images of texts, like scan documents

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,000
or photos into machine learning,
machine readable editable text.

8
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:34,910
What it does it allow you to search, copy
and edit text from images, making them

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,179
more, readable, accessible, and usable.

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,799
OCR enables intelligent automation
by digitizing and processing

11
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,239
document based information.

12
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,300
OCR was valued as at a massive 9.3 billion
in 2022 with strong growth expected

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,339
by 2030 due to increased demand of
automation and digital transformation.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,130
So that, coming to the topics that I'll
be covering today, I'll be covering today

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,370
the technical foundation, which, in turns
cover how the OCR system actually work.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,870
we'll also be talking about the framework
of using OCR in different industries,

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,670
and the practical industry application
in, healthcare, finance, legal, and also

18
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,860
we'll talk about education sector as well.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,320
finally we'll discuss how OCR enhances
efficiency and digital transformation

20
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,080
across these various sectors.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,490
coming to the slide, two.

22
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,714
this shows, the, graph shows additional
adoption, rate across various, continents.

23
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:45,845
as it shows, the North America has the
highest adoption rate, of 82%, followed by

24
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:52,280
Europe, which is 78, and then followed by
Asia Pacific around 65, person, which is

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,949
the most emerging potential, that OCR has.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,269
news research has shown that AI and
machine learning integrate, integration

27
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:05,450
boost OCR growth, and it's gonna be,
gonna do it in the coming years as well.

28
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,659
deep learning based OCR
solution shows high potential.

29
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,900
and it's also being discovered that
banking, and financial service,

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,310
which is BFSI domain, has the
largest market share in 2022.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,450
coming to, how this OCR technical
architecture, works and what

32
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,950
are the stages involved in it?

33
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,370
coming to the first stage, which is known
as image pre-processing, this stage also,

34
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,040
can be subdivided into further sub stages.

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,880
let's talk about that first.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,500
the first, sub stages ization.

37
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,450
Which convert the gray scale image
to binary using adaptive thresholding

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,950
to handle the, lighting variations.

39
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,920
The second sub stage is orientation
correction, which detects and, correct

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,020
the SKUs using, HOF transformation
and, projection profile analysis.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,940
The third sub stage is noise reduction,
which is a very important stage.

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
in pre-processing.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,510
It removes artifacts
using, median filtering.

44
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,125
Gaussian smoothing and,
more follicle operation.

45
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,105
I've used some heavy terms here.

46
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:14,975
I understand that.

47
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,435
so let's, take a small
deep dive in into it.

48
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,505
What is like gian smoothing?

49
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,835
it's a technique, that
blurs the images or data.

50
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,875
By applying, Gaussian function
effectively, it reduces

51
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,105
the noise and detail while
preserving the overall structure.

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,190
I also talked about,
more follicle operation.

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,270
What exactly it is?

54
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,960
It is again, a set of, the non-linear
filters, that analyze and modify

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,460
shapes with operation, including
erosion dilation, opening and

56
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,500
closing, coming to the fourth,
substrate, which is a resolution

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,340
enhancement, which is self-explanatory.

58
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:57,005
That is, it improves a low resolution
images using super resolution

59
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,715
and sampling and interpolation.

60
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,795
Now, what is the impact of pre-processing?

61
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:08,925
Alright, so it enhances the OCR
accuracy by up, by almost like 35%.

62
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:14,385
It also reduces the
error rate by 40 to 60%.

63
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:18,555
Especially for the degraded or low
quality document, and that is why

64
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:24,475
it's a very important stage of, OCR
coming, to the second, stage, which is

65
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:27,335
feature, extraction and recognition.

66
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:32,494
coming to this, what it does, it,
it just converts the, raw image

67
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,835
into the recognizable features.

68
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,820
It uses, again, uses, geometrical
features like shapes, angles,

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,670
strokes, and, topological features
like whole endpoint junctions, to

70
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,280
effectively, scan the document, right?

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,549
it also uses some complex scripts
and, what it also, the second, stage

72
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:57,039
of this, is character segmentation.

73
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:01,914
What it does is it identifies the
characters using connected component

74
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,284
analysis and clustering algorithm.

75
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,435
yeah, let me just, go through it.

76
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,224
what it means.

77
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:13,244
clustering, clustering algorithm, it is
again a method, used in unsupervised,

78
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:18,724
machine learning to group, similar,
data points into clusters or groups,

79
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:22,049
based on their characteristics without
any prior knowledge of the group.

80
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:27,869
and also it also improves handling
of vertical and horizontal text

81
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,569
coming to pattern recognition.

82
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,009
it uses some, some, again, some
algorithms, template matching and

83
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,289
adaptive algorithms to do that.

84
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:42,999
it, neural networks also improves,
recognition across various character sets.

85
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:47,534
And multiple classifier approach
approaches enhance, accuracy,

86
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:54,019
coming to the third, and the, the
stage which is post, processing.

87
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,574
again, a very important stage of OCR.

88
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:02,724
it represents a final critical
refinement, layer in modern OCR.

89
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:07,814
Again, it refines raw
O-C-R-O-T, OCR output into high

90
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,484
confidence and accurate text.

91
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,024
what are the techniques which are used?

92
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:18,964
It uses contextual understanding and
probability stick analysis to correct

93
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,574
the errors and what's the impact of it?

94
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:25,734
it, it is used to, make the
document or the OSHA technology.

95
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:29,979
Accurate, which is almost
like 95.8% accuracy.

96
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,999
It reduces the errors by almost 82%.

97
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,699
And it outperforms image
pre-processing, which is 92.5% in

98
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,049
feature extraction, 88 point, 7%.

99
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:49,099
key role of, post-processing is,
it elevates OCR from functional

100
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,069
to exceptional, performance.

101
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:57,069
now since we've gone through all
the stages of OCR, let's see, what's

102
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,639
a practical, implementation, which
is used in various industries?

103
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,719
let's first talk about, healthcare,
which is my favorite one.

104
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,639
how is used, what it is used for?

105
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,089
the very first thing that it's used for
is medical, record management, which,

106
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,874
where it reduces the manual entry errors.

107
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:21,594
It digitizes the patient records,
prescription insurance form and whatnot.

108
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,934
another thing is it provides,
clinical decision support.

109
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:31,114
It helps the doctors and access the
historical patient, data very easily.

110
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,944
It also provides the cr, it's very
crucial for the emergency care to provide

111
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:38,154
very quick treatment, to the patients.

112
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:42,589
the third implementation, use is
the laboratory result management,

113
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,639
which enables, fast and accurate,
access to the test results.

114
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,469
It ensures, HIPAA compliance
and reduces delays.

115
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,330
We all are aware how much,
importance, HIPAA compliant

116
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,489
has in the healthcare sector.

117
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,879
so it, it takes care of that.

118
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,089
It improves, the patient outcomes as well.

119
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,520
So this is all about the healthcare
sector, coming to the financial, sector.

120
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,620
let's first see the key,
highlights about it.

121
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,080
we have seen that in financial
sector, what it does, it, it

122
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,780
provides, 92.7% processing efficiency.

123
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
what I mean by that?

124
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,160
It is, it paper-based, paper-based,
processes are not, converted to digital,

125
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,310
reducing the bottleneck and resource use.

126
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,410
It also gives 99.1%, document accuracy.

127
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,940
so OCR technology ensures nearly
perfect accuracy in this case,

128
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,750
in document processing, reducing
errors, compliant risk, and whatnot.

129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,170
it also, has, 76.8%, time reduction.

130
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,190
processing times have drastically
dis, decreased, enabling the

131
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,170
same day service for transaction.

132
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,820
That one stop days.

133
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,790
third key highlight is
90.3% user satisfaction.

134
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,790
financial professionals, report
high satisfaction with the OCR

135
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,830
system, praising improved workflow
and less, administrative work.

136
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,080
key impact of OCR in financial sector.

137
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,770
coming to that.

138
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:18,665
from the audit perspective, what
it does for them is OCR reduces

139
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:24,625
the audit preparation time, up
to 70, 70%, from the client.

140
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:27,655
compliance perspective,
intelligence system flags,

141
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,575
regulatory issues in real time.

142
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:34,415
in banking, it's been seen
that oia speed up the customer

143
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:35,975
identification verification.

144
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,005
cutting.

145
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:41,045
it also cut down the onboarding times
and improves our fraud detection

146
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,635
and customer experience as well.

147
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:48,325
coming to the third, sector, which
is a lock, legal document management.

148
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:53,625
so what it does is OCR does, document
digitization, which is OCR technology,

149
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:58,795
speed up their digitization, and analysis
of legal document like contracts.

150
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,185
code filing and the case papers.

151
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:06,855
It also helps in a litigation support,
which is a good, very good, nice feature,

152
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:12,175
which OCR enables a faster document,
discovery by allowing, quick searches

153
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:17,175
and analysis of, large document set,
cutting down again on the manual effort.

154
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:22,065
It, it also performs some
regulatory compliance.

155
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:28,185
it automated document analysis, ensuring
compliance with legal, requirement and

156
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:30,695
deadline, while, maintaining the accuracy.

157
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,475
It also does improves,
their legal research.

158
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:40,085
OCR again improves legal research by
making historical case documents and

159
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:45,290
legal reference easier to find and
access, which again improves a lot

160
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:53,060
of time for, The fourth sector, which
is our education technology, right?

161
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,310
And, what it does there is the very nice
feature that, OCI provides, to them is

162
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,800
converting, speech, text to speech, right?

163
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,230
And it, what it does for,
the visual impairments.

164
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,350
Impaired people.

165
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,670
it's a boom to them, right?

166
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,230
it gives them high, accurate and,
whatever they, because they can't go

167
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,710
through the documents, provides the
speech, whatever they want to go through.

168
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,610
Another use case, also is
listening to books while driving.

169
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,060
So OCF plays very important role
in, in those sort of technologies.

170
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,960
and the second, key factor is
digital research, repository.

171
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,100
OCR helps convert archive documents
into searchable digital formats.

172
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,530
it may making the educational
resources easily available to

173
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,600
the students and researchers.

174
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,940
the third, important point here is the,
it also auto automate the assessment.

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,880
So OCR, that's it, streamlined the grading
of the handwritten assignments, reducing

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,900
administrative work for educators,
and speeding up feedback for students.

177
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,510
they can easily, the, the time that
is, needed for an as assessment

178
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,700
to be done is greatly reduced.

179
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,640
which is very beneficial for all the,
students and the researchers, coming

180
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,420
to the cross sector analysis, right?

181
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,370
We have gone through all the four
sectors, healthcare, financial services.

182
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,160
We've gone through the
legal and the education.

183
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,140
I. As you see in this
particular table, right?

184
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,650
all the sectors are broken down into
what is the percentage of profic,

185
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,190
processing efficiency, the document
accuracy, what's the, percentage and

186
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,520
time reduction, digital conversion
rate, and the user satisfaction.

187
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,280
So let's, let's go through
what this table, states, right?

188
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,120
And then we'll follow by what
insights we can derive from it, right?

189
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:47,965
now if you see the first one, which is
a healthcare one, healthcare sector, it

190
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:54,675
has a very strong, document accuracy of
98.2% and solid, pro, what you call as,

191
00:12:54,725 --> 00:13:00,635
processing efficiency, which is only
85% with a time reduction of 72.5%.

192
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,970
coming to our second
sector, which was financial.

193
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,050
It leads in performing with the
highest document accuracy, which

194
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:15,230
is a nine, which is 99.1%, and pro
processing efficiency of 92 7, along

195
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,155
with the, time reduction off, 76.8%.

196
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,220
coming to the legal one, it has
a good performance where's 97.8%

197
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,685
document accuracy with, and,
88.4% processing efficiency.

198
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:32,915
It has some, little lower, time reduction,
which is 70.2%, but very much acceptable.

199
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,815
coming to education, it has lower
processing efficiency of 82.6%,

200
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,485
but very high user satisfaction.

201
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:47,505
If you see there, it's an
89%, and, 65%, time reduction.

202
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:52,355
So what we can derive from this particular
table right across various sectors.

203
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:56,175
financial services excel
in most categories.

204
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,735
That's the second rule that we can see.

205
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:03,595
we also see that healthcare, shows
strong document accuracy, which

206
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:06,725
is used to diagnose, diagnose
a prescription and whatnot.

207
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:12,095
coming to education, it has
very high satis, satisfaction

208
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,475
despite low efficiency.

209
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,730
which works in favors of edu, favor
of education sector and all the

210
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,170
sector experience, significant time
saving compared to manual process.

211
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,110
going to the next page, which is, what
is the future development and integration

212
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,560
challenges that OCR, has, right?

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,595
So it's been shown, like the
deep learning integration.

214
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,115
it's currently deep
learning machine learning.

215
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,665
It's, it's in demand.

216
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,545
it's going on.

217
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:49,635
There's a strong acceptance rate and
it's also with, in combination with OCR.

218
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:53,130
It is it's gonna improve the
feature extraction and pattern

219
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,920
recognition, which will again enhance.

220
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,515
everything in OCR, in all the all sectors.

221
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:04,375
and regarding the second future
development that we see is a multilingual

222
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:08,605
recognition, handling diverse
character sets and writing system.

223
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:14,215
Third one is a edge computing
deployment, which is optimizing models

224
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,995
for devices and limited resources,
regarding, data quality management.

225
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,400
It has better, it'll be better
people processing for handling

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,750
that document variation.

227
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,020
the fifth one is a security
framework protected how

228
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,280
important it is in all sector.

229
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:33,240
We are, we, everyone is aware of,
so it pro provide the protecting,

230
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,590
sensitive information, right?

231
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,000
So what we derive from it, right?

232
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,440
What are the key insights,
regarding the future?

233
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,135
as we see here, right?

234
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:49,405
OCR technology advancing, quickly,
driven by AI and, deep learning

235
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,885
challenges include, know, balancing,
security, accuracy and scalability.

236
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:58,535
which, along with ai,
it's gonna improve a lot.

237
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:03,665
Future, OCS system will go
beyond character recognition to

238
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,885
include contextual understanding.

239
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,545
Multi-format processing
and real time analytics.

240
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:14,105
how important is analytics
in all the industries?

241
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:18,875
I don't think I have to explain, to
anyone, but, so it's gonna be a really

242
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:23,955
great combination of OCR with, there
are deep learning, multilingual and

243
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,170
machine, machine learning in the future.

244
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:31,865
And these advances will revolutionize, in
our digital sector, operations in sectors

245
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:37,245
like healthcare, again, finance, legal and
education, which again, which reducing the

246
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:39,825
manual work and unlocking new insights.

247
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:45,525
here I come to an end of
the, this, my presentation.

248
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:46,755
thank you for listening in.

249
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,895
hope you gain some insight
about OCR, and happy learning.

250
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:51,645
Thank you.

251
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:52,305
Thank you everyone.
