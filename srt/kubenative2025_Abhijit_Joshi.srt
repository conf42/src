1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello all.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,160
Hope everyone is doing fine
and welcome to this session.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,649
Today we'll explore how generative AI in
maintenance for automotive manufacturing.

4
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:17,285
We'll look at the journey from
downtime to data-driven up.

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:22,075
This patient presentation will
highlight key concepts, technologies,

6
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,055
and implementation strategies.

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:30,015
The automotive factories constantly
struggle with an unexpected equipment

8
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:35,675
breakdowns that hals the production
line and creates substantial unplanned

9
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:39,395
equipment expenses emerging generative ai.

10
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:47,295
Definitely provide a solution to bridge
this gap by decoding complex signals

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,884
and data coming from sensors on the
production line and analyzing that

12
00:00:53,884 --> 00:01:01,124
information, create some cool results,
which we will look at in details as we

13
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,344
move through this product presentation.

14
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:04,654
So with that note.

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,229
Let me move forward

16
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:06,939
now.

17
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,229
Quick introduction about me.

18
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,879
I'm Abijit Joshi.

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,579
I'm a supply chain
transformation specialist.

20
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,219
I'm currently working at Deloitte
Consulting and I have total 20 years

21
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,049
of experience in leading digital
transformation initiatives across

22
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:27,734
and across different automotive
manufacturing sites, as well as I

23
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,444
have also work in other industries.

24
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:34,545
I specialized in data-driven
operation excellence and

25
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,104
predictive maintenance solution.

26
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:41,244
Through my journey of 20 years, I have
seen multiple different implementation

27
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:46,995
for maintenance and as in firsthand
experience, I started my career with the

28
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:51,425
maintenance module in the manufacturing
industry for five to six years.

29
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:55,355
I have had hands-on
experience in the maintenance.

30
00:01:55,855 --> 00:02:00,525
Situation for my old company, and
then I moved to the ERP consulting.

31
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,345
So that was just a quick
introduction about me.

32
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:08,915
Now let's move forward, jump into
the concept and understand what we

33
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,325
are trying to achieve through this.

34
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,655
Now here is the abstract and overview.

35
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,410
Now what challenge we
are here to solve today.

36
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,670
Based on the recent data, unplanned
equipment, downtime cost automotive

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,680
manufacturers up to 22,000 per minute,
as in loss, and the traditional

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,410
manufacturing strategies are inadequate.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Address this challenge now.

40
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:35,825
What is the solve, which we are
gonna see through this presentation

41
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,930
now with recent AI developments?

42
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:46,165
Applying generative AI to predictive
maintenance in ERP system can

43
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,105
reduce your planned downtime by 40%.

44
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:54,195
This session explores the approach
of how any implementation, how

45
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:58,275
any maintenance application
implementation can leverage this.

46
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:02,865
How AI can help to analyze
data provided by sensors on the

47
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:04,550
production line and this data.

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,130
Arranged into a structured
workflow pattern can fed into a

49
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,880
maintenance system to generate
the preventative maintenance work.

50
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,240
So that's the solve which a
new technology can bring in.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,400
Now as we move forward, we will
see what are the different ways

52
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,910
of achieving this outcome Now.

53
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:32,225
There are few more points where this
advanced computing system identify early

54
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:37,595
signs of ation that are often missed
by a standard monitoring equipment

55
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:40,265
or even by a human interaction.

56
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,815
There is a chance it can be missed.

57
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,710
Now, car manufacturers integrating
this capability directly into their

58
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,465
enterprise resource planning system,
which has fundamentally changed.

59
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,895
We create the work order in
order to act on these problems.

60
00:03:57,395 --> 00:04:03,405
So with that note, let's move
forward and see that how we

61
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,485
can go through this journey.

62
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,985
Now let's talk about the
traditional maintenance methods.

63
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:11,485
Typically, there are three
ways of handling maintenance,

64
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,365
calendar-based maintenance.

65
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:17,345
Based maintenance or
condition based maintenance.

66
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:21,835
Now, even if we take our day-to-day
examples, like having your own

67
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,925
card, it needs some maintenance.

68
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:28,985
So you can either go by one of
these three methods during my

69
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,515
visits to different industry.

70
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:36,245
These are three methods which I
have extensively seen getting used

71
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:37,835
in the traditional maintenance.

72
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:42,075
Whether it's being a manufacturing
plant, it's being oil and gas refinery.

73
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,795
These were mainly three interfaces.

74
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,345
Now, let's talk a little bit about them.

75
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:52,585
When we say calendar based, it's
a fixed interval that after three

76
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:57,670
months, I'm gonna maintain, I'm gonna
do some 1, 2, 3, 4 activities for

77
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,390
this specific piece of the equipment.

78
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,030
What are the challenges?

79
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,500
It can be premature.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,760
It can even am expected failures
because you're just following the time.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,660
You're not looking, was the machine
utilized enough in this time period?

82
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,150
Now, next is a usage base.

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,230
Now maintenance based on some run
cycle or account better understand.

84
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,140
How long it has been used.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,970
So after that specific time, you do
the maintenance, again, this is not

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,260
a right way of doing the maintenance.

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,290
Third is the condition base.

88
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,700
Let's say you monitor some
parameters and based on certain

89
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,325
life of that parameter you create.

90
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:45,455
Work order.

91
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:49,555
So these are three typical
traditional maintenance methods.

92
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:53,985
Now let's move forward and look
at what are the challenges of this

93
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:55,755
traditional maintenance method.

94
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,835
First challenges, this is
the reactive maintenance.

95
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:01,585
This is not a proactive approach.

96
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:06,585
So the traditional maintenance system
is basically reactive in nature.

97
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,175
That based on certain problems, you
try to solve the problem and it's

98
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:16,525
very much disruptive to the production
lines and the production flows.

99
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:20,975
Then there are fixed schedule
limitations, so there could be a chance

100
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:26,835
that equipments are service too early
or too late, and it's also a vestige

101
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,145
of resources and risking of failures.

102
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,165
Which is a typical challenge
of the traditional maintenance.

103
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,715
And third and the most important
is lack of data driven decisions.

104
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:41,465
So the moment we say we are doing it
by fixed time interval or calendar

105
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:47,210
base, we are not utilizing any past
data, which is a typical challenge.

106
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,105
Now let's move forward
and see is there any way.

107
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:54,815
We can convert this reactive
into proactive approach.

108
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:59,845
Now, this slide talks about that, how
we can convert a reactive approach

109
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:04,515
into a proactive approach, and that
is what the maintenance team needs,

110
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:09,625
which will help them to proactively
use to right use their resources.

111
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,275
So generative AI plays a wider
role in this room for patients.

112
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:18,485
It can transform maintenance from
reactive firefighting to proactive

113
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:23,225
optimization to a data-driven
insight and predictive analysis.

114
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,525
Now, let's see, how can we achieve this?

115
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:30,735
So typically there are three drivers
for the approach which we are proposing.

116
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,260
So one is the iot.

117
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,180
So when I say iot, it's
internet of things.

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,130
It's a kind of bridge between
what is happening at the equipment

119
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,420
versus how it can translate to
the signal, a kind of transducer,

120
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,670
what we had in the earlier ages.

121
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,700
So one of the driver to achieve
this proactive approach is the iot

122
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,095
integrations where your equipment
will talk and generate data signals.

123
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,015
The second driver is the ERP.

124
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:05,485
So typically, most of these industries, a
car manufacturing industry, have some kind

125
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:10,485
of system behind the scene, which tells
them how much is their inventory, what

126
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:15,365
is their work order, how many times they
have to do a certain kind of activity in

127
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:18,155
terms of maintenance of that equipment.

128
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,795
So these are handled through a ERP system.

129
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:22,675
Third is the generative ai.

130
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:28,185
Now, generative AI is the most important
driver out of all this, which sits on top

131
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:31,500
of IOT and ER to generate the research.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,830
Now, we talked about the three
important drivers in this approach.

133
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,090
Now let's move forward and
look at what framework we are

134
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,050
suggesting in order to move.

135
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,260
Reactive to proactive approach.

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,810
Now, generative AI for
predictive maintenance framework.

137
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,230
If you see on your left hand side picture
at the top, that we are suggesting let's

138
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,390
collect the data from different sensors.

139
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,700
Look at your maintenance history.

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,910
See your performance metrics.

141
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,250
Now you have this huge data.

142
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,570
Now this data has to be read and analyzed.

143
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,180
Before sending it to the ERP system,
so ERP should get the important data,

144
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,850
which it needs to do certain actions.

145
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,350
Now, gen AI engine comes next to this.

146
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,200
It sits on top of ERP where it
analyze that data and give ERPA signal

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,230
rather than some predefined engines.

148
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,580
It tells that, hey, this is a
time that you have to create

149
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,990
the maintenance work orders.

150
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,570
These are the times based on the
equipment deterioration or the

151
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,340
capacity it has been utilized.

152
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,920
You should be performing your
maintenance, and that is what goes to

153
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,270
your manufacturing system within ERP, and
that generates the real time information.

154
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,870
Now there are possibly three
actions which can happen.

155
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,660
System one is automated action,
which is creating a maintenance work

156
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,020
product, which tells technician that
he was, he's supposed to go and do a

157
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,670
maintenance on this particular equipment.

158
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,750
Secondly, deriving a plan becomes
a very optimal because now you can

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,850
plan your future work order based
on your downtime of the machine.

160
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,430
Third is generating multiple
KPIs outta this information.

161
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,999
So this is the approach which we are
proposing, which can convert your reactive

162
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:34,754
maintenance into a proactive maintenance.

163
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:40,644
Now let's move forward and see what
is the role of each of this component.

164
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:42,224
In this process.

165
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:45,039
So the first is iot, internet of Things.

166
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,229
Now, what is its role?

167
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:50,649
Its role is to collect the data
from all different production lines.

168
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,439
Imagine you're working at the car
manufacturing facility and you have

169
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,469
tons of data coming from everywhere
initial stage, from building

170
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:05,709
different parts till the last stage
where you do a painting of your car.

171
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:10,164
There is lot of robotics
used in this production line.

172
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:15,804
Given the demand which this
industry is seeing, there is a lot

173
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:19,554
of automation happening on each
of the phase of manufacturing.

174
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:25,794
This automation definitely triggers a
lot of information, which is basically

175
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:30,054
internet of things, where you collect
all that sensor information and

176
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:31,764
translate into a respective signal.

177
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:36,664
So if you look at the three points
mentioned here, realtime sensor data,

178
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:41,514
the sensors embedded in the machine
capture the realtime data such as

179
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:45,899
vibration, temperature, pressure,
it assess the entire equipment.

180
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,649
Health predictive analysis,
analytics foundation.

181
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,099
This is.

182
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,124
To analyze that information.

183
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:56,464
Continuous monitoring IOT networks
provide continuous monitoring,

184
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:59,344
which is not possible for any human.

185
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,324
So that is the first aspect
and the role of the iot.

186
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,784
Now let's move forward and look
at the second important component

187
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:10,814
in this workflow, which is ERP.

188
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,424
So what is the role of ERP integration?

189
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:21,204
I mentioned before, ERP is used for
having all different aspects of the

190
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:27,094
company, whether it's a pro purchase order
production, work order, or your inventory.

191
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:33,264
So apart from creating a maintenance work
order, it also facilitates a data which

192
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:34,799
is required to fulfill that work order.

193
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:40,129
What parts you need, what instructions
are there for performing that operation or

194
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,669
maintenance and what resources you need.

195
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:49,229
So the idea here is IOT provides
that information to ERP, and rather

196
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:54,089
than having a traditional engine
of preventative maintenance based

197
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,209
on the calendar, it reads that data
and try to generate a work order.

198
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,289
If there is a situation where maintenance
is required, it can predict that ahead

199
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,709
of a time based on the current equipment.

200
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,299
So if we read two or three points
here, which is the predictive

201
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:14,649
maintenance management, this is
the ERP system management module.

202
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,404
Automated work order generation
ERPA automatically creates a work

203
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,614
order and allocates the resources.

204
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:26,824
When AI detects any potential issues
and continuous improvement feedback,

205
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:33,184
ERP feedback refines AI module
improving predictions and accuracy.

206
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:37,624
Now let's look at the third aspect,
the role of generative ai, which

207
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:41,884
is the most important aspect
in all these three parameters.

208
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:45,894
Now, what AI does, AI is
modeling equipment behavior.

209
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,354
It generates equipment behavior
to understand and predict

210
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:50,554
the potential failures.

211
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:52,854
Secondly, synthetic data generation.

212
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:56,994
It generates a synthetic data
scenario to simulate different

213
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:58,914
operational condition for the analysis.

214
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:03,404
It also keeps learning based on
the real time data as we have seen.

215
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,915
IOTs constantly providing your data.

216
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,709
Now generative AI has capability to
self learn from the history as well

217
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,929
as with the new data, which is coming
and understand the failure pattern.

218
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:22,459
Third is proactive maintenance forecasting
based on a data it's reading, it can

219
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,469
forecast what are the maintenance lead.

220
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,179
It's not just about maintaining
any equipment, it's also about

221
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:31,579
making sure you have enough.

222
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,249
Perform that activity.

223
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:37,299
You have enough resources,
they're at the right time.

224
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,879
Execute that activity so
Gen AI can perform all that

225
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,049
activity behind the scene.

226
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:49,024
So we have looked at the three aspects
of this process and what is their

227
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,234
role in performing this operation.

228
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:52,914
Now let's move forward.

229
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,519
And see that what are the target
application, which we think, again,

230
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,829
the possibilities are endless, but
we think that these two are very

231
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,449
important applications within the car
manufacturing, like the robotic system

232
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:13,310
and the pen application line, where the
solutions can be implemented because

233
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,480
these are the most prone things in the
process, which can lag the productivity.

234
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:22,594
If there is a maintenance failure,
so early failure detection in

235
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:26,004
automated assembly and welding
robots through continuous

236
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,804
monitoring of operational patterns.

237
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:33,714
This can be achieved through generative
AI with the continuous monitoring

238
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:39,255
paint application lines, predictive
maintenance for paint, booth equipment

239
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:43,964
and spray system to prevent any
quality issues and any downtime.

240
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,409
So these are some target applications.

241
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:50,209
Now let's see, what is our
implementation strategy?

242
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:54,379
Now, this is pretty high level view
of the implementation strategy.

243
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,509
Definitely if you are running any pilot
program, you have to have much details,

244
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,539
but we categorized into three steps.

245
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,379
One is leveraging existing infrastructure.

246
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,199
So the point here is.

247
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,569
Do I need to create the entirely new
infrastructure or I can leverage existing?

248
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:15,589
So answer is you can leverage
your existing infrastructure, use

249
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,419
your current sensors, your data.

250
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,009
The only thing is now it'll
go to a certain data warehouse

251
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,894
where it'll get, analyze and
translate into a readable format.

252
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:27,814
Now step.

253
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:33,534
Integrate predictive intelligence
seamlessly into existing workflow and

254
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:38,124
create the preventative work order
and assign them to the technicians so

255
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,564
you can start leveraging your data.

256
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,944
Third step is scale, gradual adoption.

257
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,439
So the approach we're
trying to suggest here.

258
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,274
Go stepwise, go a phase wise.

259
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:54,444
If you have 10 plans, go with one plant
first or possibly even a one product line.

260
00:16:54,944 --> 00:17:00,434
So then there are minimum disruption
to the existing process, and once you

261
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:04,999
prove your result, then you can move
to a larger scale of implementation.

262
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:09,219
So once you implement this
strategy, what are the results?

263
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,509
You can expect, somebody can
ask that, okay, I'm implementing

264
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:14,919
this, but what are the results?

265
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,879
So we have studied this implementation
across the industries, and these are

266
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,059
some proven results from the deployment.

267
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:30,764
Again, it'll be very for some of the
companies versus other, but this is a

268
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:32,729
kind of ballpark which we can expect.

269
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:38,329
So your downtime reduction should
at least go to 40% because now

270
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:43,850
you have put intelligence into
the system, which will help you to

271
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,459
reduce unscheduled time, downtime.

272
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,879
Secondly, forecasting accuracy.

273
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,009
Now, the earlier forecasting
was based on the calendar dates.

274
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,209
Now you're using system
intelligence to do a forecasting.

275
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,469
So definitely we see.

276
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,819
Around 85% improvement in that accuracy.

277
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:10,129
Your equipment deterioration is utilized
to predict what maintenance you need.

278
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,309
Third is reduction in the false alarm.

279
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,979
With the traditional method, you
can do a maintenance based on,

280
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,259
again, the calendar days, right?

281
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,559
So there could be a chance of the fall.

282
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,360
Now with AI integration and the pattern
recognition, it can reduce to 50%.

283
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,310
Now, when we say we have this fabulous
result from our deployment, definitely

284
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,010
what are the outcome in terms of
cost and efficiency I can measure.

285
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,980
So again, we did study based
on our prior implementation.

286
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,770
These are the results we see.

287
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,500
Again, just to call out.

288
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,739
This may not be specific
to one client to other.

289
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,379
It's based on what is the expected
outcome, a kind of ballpark.

290
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,649
So your maintenance cost should
reduce by 30% by optimizing

291
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,260
scheduling as well as resources.

292
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,575
And secondly, since you
have lot of historical data.

293
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:15,905
From prior corrections, from even if
there is some first time fixed rate,

294
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,665
it should be improved to the 90%.

295
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:24,085
That is what we expect as an
achievement with this implementation.

296
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:28,520
Now let's move forward and see
what are the key benefits we are

297
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,960
getting with this implementation.

298
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,990
So when is plant repairs?

299
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:36,145
Now since you have intelligence,
you can very well plant your

300
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:40,975
maintenance schedule without pausing
instead of emergency shutdowns.

301
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:45,935
So you reduce your emergency shutdowns
due to the better monitoring of

302
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:49,355
equipment, you enhance the reliability.

303
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:55,355
So transform maintenance into a
strategic driven of production stability.

304
00:19:55,855 --> 00:20:00,025
Third efficiency, which we have
seen on the earlier slide, that

305
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:04,555
you achieve significant cost saving
to optimize maintenance operation.

306
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:10,215
So there are multiple benefits of having
this implementation, but this three we see

307
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:17,000
as most prominent benefits from performing
this reactive to proactive transformation.

308
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,240
Now the next slide and the concluding
slide in this discussion is what should

309
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,600
be our vision if we implementing and if
we are on the journey of implementing this

310
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,240
methodology, our vision should be zero.

311
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,780
Downtime.

312
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,700
Factory vision with growing
gen, AI acceptability across

313
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,450
multiple industries and even in
the car manufacturing industries.

314
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:48,600
That serves as a core enabler to achieve
the zero time downtime factory vision.

315
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,180
Even the future automation system,
we can expect that they will

316
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,510
self-diagnose, self repair, and enhance
reliability and the cost effectiveness.

317
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:02,840
So with that note, let thank
to everyone for listening.

318
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,820
And giving.
