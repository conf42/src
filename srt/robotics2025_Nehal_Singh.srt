00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,130
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,930
Today we are going to talk about something
that's put urgent and often overlooked

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,600
how to secure robot networks for the
future where quantum computers exist.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,259
The robots we are deploying today, whether
in manufacturing, healthcare, defense, or

5
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:23,840
even logistics, will still be operating
five, 10, even 15 years from now.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,890
Meanwhile, quantum computing is
evolving rapidly even though large scale

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,950
quantum computers aren't here yet, the
threat landscape is already shifting.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,350
Robotic systems combine long lived
hardware sensitive and operational data.

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,610
And real time autonomy, which makes them
prime targets for both current, future

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,190
current and also our future adversaries.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,800
So my goal today with this topic
is to show you how robotics and

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,240
how can we architect systems
that stay secure for decades.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,599
Let's start with this matter right now.

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,940
Quantum computers are expected to break
widely used cryptography protocols like

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,420
RSA and ECC using Shor's algorithm.

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,100
That means the algorithms that
secure our robot communications

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,995
command channels, and firmware
today will be eventually vulnerable.

18
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:28,350
Even more concerning is the
harvest now decrypt later strategy.

19
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:35,720
Attackers are already collecting encrypted
data, telemetry maps, sensor logs,

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,050
firmware, blobs so they can decrypt them.

21
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,530
Once the quantum capability becomes
available, robots generate long-lived

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,200
data, configuration files, mission
histories, telemetry archives.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,750
They also receive update and commands
that must remain trusted for years.

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,430
That long-term value makes a perfect
target for quantum motivated adversaries.

25
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,130
Robotic has a unique attack
surface because it blends cyber

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,410
as well as the physical systems.

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,620
A breach in a robot is just about data.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,350
It can cause physical disruptions as well.

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,840
Control and telemetry channels
can be intercepted and spoofed.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,950
Firmware updates, especially OTA, are
a major entry point for attackers.

31
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,030
iRobot communication has high
bandwidth and low latency,

32
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,790
making it sensitive to tampering.

33
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,750
Then on top of that, it's not only that,
but we also now have cloud integration.

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,210
We also have APIs, we have
brokers, we have containerized

35
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,850
services that robots depend on.

36
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,020
So there are so many other cloud and
broker services plus API and so much

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,540
office services that they depend on.

38
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:02,865
And even with sensor data like
lidar or camera streams, they need

39
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:07,665
authentication because manipulated
sensor input can change a robot

40
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:12,375
behavior and can cause a hacker to
easily have control over a robot.

41
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:17,765
So every layer exposes a different
vulnerability, and quantum attacks

42
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:22,654
will only widen those gaps until
we upgrade our cryptography.

43
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,374
The good news is we
already have solutions.

44
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,354
NISD has standards.

45
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,964
The first generation of post quantum
cryp cryptography algorithm, the

46
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:37,999
two key ones that we'll talk about
is BER and the D lithium Kyber

47
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,884
is a key encapsulation mechanism
that provides secure key exchange.

48
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:47,704
Replacing RSA and ECCD Lithium
is a signature algorithm.

49
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:55,760
That ensures integrity, identity, and
trust perfect for things like command

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
authentication and firmware signing.

51
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,880
These algorithms are lat based, and
more importantly, they are ready today.

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,540
Open source libraries exist.

53
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,435
Implementations are maturing, and hardware
support is almost starting to land.

54
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:18,274
So after talking about the kit, let's
see how we can transition and how we can

55
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,344
bridge the gap with the hybrid models.

56
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:25,085
So transitioning an entire fleet
of robots to new cryptography

57
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,794
doesn't happen overnight.

58
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,215
This is where hybrid
cryptography comes in.

59
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:35,445
A modern runs a hybrid model runs
classical algorithms and post

60
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,065
quantum algorithms in parallel.

61
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,880
That means you have R-S-A-E-C-C based
systems keep working while PQC adds

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
a quantum safe layer on top of it.

63
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,380
So if one algorithm is broken, the
other still protects the system.

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
Now hybrid, TTLS or SSH is the first step.

65
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,360
It enables you to gradually upgrade robot
communications without even breaking the

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,610
compatibility with legacy components.

67
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,790
So it's our, it's the most practical
way out there to start your migration.

68
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,419
Today, when we design a quantum
safe robot network, we need to

69
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,429
think about entire lifecycle.

70
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:22,334
From the robot to the cloud to
all the systems it's tied to.

71
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:26,884
At the robot layer, we use
lightweight crypto for local

72
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:29,854
verification and integrity checks.

73
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:36,424
Since robot have limited compute and power
budgets, edge gateways become critical.

74
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:42,474
They can handle heavier PQC operations,
which offloads the cryptographic burden

75
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:44,874
from the robot while translating the.

76
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:51,445
Secure protocols and in the
cloud, all APIs, mod channels

77
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:56,455
and remote debugging interfaces
should use PQC enabled TLS or SSH.

78
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:02,374
Finally firmware and OT updates
must be signed with a quantum safe

79
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:08,284
signatures like de lithium that
ensures a robot trusts the update 15

80
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,835
years from now just as it does today.

81
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:14,635
In robotics, zero Trust
is no longer optional.

82
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:19,875
These system operate independently
and are often untrusted environments.

83
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:28,090
Zero trust means we verify every device,
every action, every packet continuously.

84
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,479
Robots should prove their identity
to maintain the least privilege, a

85
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:40,229
access, and provide behavioral telemetry
so system can detect anomalies.

86
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,299
This identity layer becomes
much stronger with PQC.

87
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,629
Quantum safe signatures ensure
that identity and trust can be

88
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,689
forged even by future adversaries.

89
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:59,079
Zero Trust gives us resilience
today, and PQC ensures that

90
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,149
it lasts into the quantum era.

91
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,219
Now let's talk about a little
bit how we can put into practice.

92
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:09,299
So if we have to operationalize
this, if we have to put a plan

93
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,124
to this, how will we do this?

94
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:15,314
First of all, step one is
cryptographic inventory.

95
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:21,585
Map every encryption and signing
mechanism across your robot ecosystem,

96
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,814
devices, gateways, and cloud pipelines.

97
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:30,344
Next, how do we prioritize
the risk across?

98
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:36,886
So the most critical areas are
firmware command channels, and the OTA.

99
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:39,456
Then pilot hybrid TLS.

100
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,286
Let's start small.

101
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:45,966
From there, perhaps a gateway to
the cloud, which is connecting

102
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,286
your robot to the cloud.

103
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:52,986
Observe the handshake, performance of
that latency, and even compatibility.

104
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:59,876
Ensure your hardware modules, HSM
and tpms, secure enclaves and are

105
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,155
capable of supporting the PQC.

106
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:07,155
Finally document the governance
and the incident response.

107
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:12,245
Quantum safe security isn't
only algorithms, it's also an

108
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,485
organizational process towards security.

109
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:19,680
As with any cryptographic
transition, there are pitfalls too.

110
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,770
Algorithm substitution is a real issue.

111
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,561
A vehicle algorithm unless you
enforce a stricter PQC policy.

112
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:32,381
Legacy systems often can't
suppose support PQC natively.

113
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,941
So rather than replacing them
immediately, you can wrap or

114
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:39,221
sandbox them in secure gateways.

115
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:43,671
Vendor dependency is another
challenge, so not all the vendors

116
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,736
you would use are PQC ready.

117
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:50,346
But making the decisions on the
spot is also difficult because

118
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:54,606
an organization from a business
standpoint is already engaged with

119
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:57,066
a vendor for such a big inventory.

120
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:02,726
So try to choose from those modular
crypto APIs and clear roadmaps.

121
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:06,566
And finally, independent
testing is also essential.

122
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,076
Cryptography is hard
to implement correctly.

123
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,836
But third party validations.

124
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:17,666
And then having professional services
helps catch subtle but critical flaws.

125
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,266
The transition to quantum safe
robotics should start now.

126
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,315
First inventory in your cryptography.

127
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:28,095
Second pilot PQC in control environment.

128
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,335
Third, build the policies and governance.

129
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:34,095
So transition is consistent and scalable.

130
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:38,675
Robotics is becoming central
to the industry, healthcare,

131
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,625
defense, and also society.

132
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,756
Eventually, the best time to
secure these systems was yesterday.

133
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,156
The next best time is today.

134
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:52,065
I encourage you to join open source
communities advancing PQC and robotic

135
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:57,825
security, and this is a collective
effort and the work we do today will

136
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:01,786
now define the safety and security
of tomorrow's autonomous system.

137
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you everyone.
