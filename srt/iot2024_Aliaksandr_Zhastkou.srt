1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:01,370
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,040
Thanks a lot for joining my talk today.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,699
I hope you liked my intro from the Alps.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,209
It was quite cold there.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,979
My name is Alex.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,089
I'm a product owner in Yandex.

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,950
Yandex is one of the largest tech
companies globally, providing a wide

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,189
range of services, including search
engines, maps, transportation, e commerce,

9
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,990
cloud computing, and AI technologies.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,190
I work in on delivery service.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Today, I'm excited to share
insights on how new technologies are

12
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,910
transforming product communications.

13
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,949
Drawing from my experience, scaling
Yandex delivery and industry leading

14
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:45,369
trends, few words about myself, over
seven years in product communications

15
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,490
contributed to the 100 growth of
Yandex delivery service, over 18

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,600
million users served in four years.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,520
For now, Yandex.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,610
Delivery operates in 22 countries.

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,450
So why adopting new trends in
product communications matters?

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,970
McKinsey report that 35 percent
of Amazon's revenue is driven by

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,540
AI based product recommendations.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,549
So the first reason is
competitive advantage.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,210
Salesforce report that 72 percent of
businesses using AI in communications

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,360
report high customer retention.

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,770
The second one.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,860
Customer expectations.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,400
McKinsey report that 80 percent
of customers expect personalized

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,370
experience in every interaction.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,390
Third, efficiency gains.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,239
HubSpot says that automating
communications reduces campaign

31
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,640
launch time by 30 percent
and operational cost by 20%.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,490
Awesome.

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,370
Data driven decisions.

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,475
For example, Internet of Things
devices generate 90 zettabytes

35
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:57,050
of actionable data annually,
driving better customer insights.

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,500
And fifth future proofing Gartner
reports that 96 percent of companies

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,700
plan to increase AI and internet
of things investments by 2025.

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,860
Our discussion will cover four key
areas, understanding what product

39
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,850
communications are, exploring how AI
driven tools enhance them and diving

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,900
into advanced segmentation methods.

41
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,260
Finally, we will look at
what the future holds.

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,870
Okay, let's start by defining
what product communications are.

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,070
Product communications focus on connecting
customers with the value of your product.

44
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,459
From emails to Internet of Things enabled
notifications, each channel serves to

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,169
educate, engage, and convert users.

46
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,879
Here are some product
communications examples.

47
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:51,689
There are a large number of types of
communications, like push notifications,

48
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:56,079
product recommendations, social
media, communications, and chatbots.

49
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,679
By integrating customer data through
CRM systems, these communications

50
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,829
become more personalized and impactful.

51
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,219
When we hear about CRM marketing.

52
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:11,274
We associate it with different
words like spam, loyalty program,

53
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:15,984
email newsletter, CRM system, and
WhatsApp messenger, for example.

54
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:19,424
Let's figure out what CRM is.

55
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:22,634
CRM is Customer Relationship Management.

56
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:27,414
And the first thesis for today
is that CRM communications are

57
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,954
communications based on customer data.

58
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:34,464
In general, any promotion is
based on studying your audience.

59
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:38,514
But CRM systems take this
process to a new level.

60
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:42,944
Imagine that you can build a
sales strategy not on hypotheses

61
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:47,084
and assumptions, but on real
information about your customers.

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,594
You know what, to whom, at what point,
and through what channel to offer

63
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,204
in order to achieve conversions.

64
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:00,574
Let's look at how CRM helps to personalize
communication and get more sales.

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,844
Here are the channels commonly used.

66
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,289
Email, SMS, push notifications,
chatbots, and even Internet of Things.

67
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,129
Effective product communications
require selecting the right

68
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,029
channels to reach your audience.

69
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:19,629
From AI driven emails to Internet of
Things enabled reminders on smart devices,

70
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,639
the focus should always be on creating
a seamless personalized experience.

71
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:30,419
For example, a fitness tracker can send
personalized reminders, keeping users

72
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,959
engaged and boosting retention by 25%.

73
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,989
Part two, how AI driven
tools enhance communications.

74
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:42,479
If any of you are planning to work
in communications or are going to

75
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,439
connect an agency or hire a manager,
let's talk about stages in the

76
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,349
creation of product communications.

77
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,299
The communication process begins with
data collection and segmentation.

78
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,569
Move through strategy
and creative development.

79
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:01,209
and ends with testing
and performance analysis.

80
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,879
This structured approach
ensures measurable outcomes.

81
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,349
Large CRM companies are increasingly
integrating AI technologies designed to

82
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,339
assist or even replace some of the tasks
traditionally performed by CRM marketers.

83
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,114
These AI driven systems can analyze
user data, propose hypotheses, create

84
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:27,924
personalized communication strategies,
and conduct A B testing, making them

85
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:29,854
powerful tools in modern marketing.

86
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,804
Let's look at some examples.

87
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,334
Salesforce Einstein.

88
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:39,755
Salesforce has implemented AI capabilities
that automate tasks such as lead

89
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:44,035
prioritization, customer segmentation,
and personalized communication.

90
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:49,755
Einstein can analyze user behavior
and predict customer needs, enabling

91
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,755
marketers to act proactively.

92
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,215
Automation and self service technologies
can give businesses across all industry

93
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:02,564
industries a significant productivity
boost, generate cost savings and an

94
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,244
increase in customer satisfaction.

95
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,750
Last year, customers using Salesforce
service cloud tools, including automation

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,549
and self service tools, such as AI
powered chatbots, saw a 30 percent

97
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:19,410
increase in customer satisfaction
and more than 27 percent increase in

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,399
agent productivity, customer retention
and case resolution, very awesome.

99
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,309
If you want to know more about
Salesforce AI tools, please find the

100
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:33,389
official Salesforce website, where
you can find full information about

101
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,179
the tools and also try them yourself.

102
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,529
HubSpot AI tools are another example.

103
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:44,489
HubSpot uses AI to power features
like content generation, automated

104
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,999
workflows and predictive lead scoring.

105
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,469
The system helps marketers identify trends
and optimize campaigns in real time.

106
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,099
One more example of AI chatbot.

107
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,879
HubSpot integrated AI chatbots
into its CRM to automate

108
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,359
early customer interactions.

109
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:09,219
These bots analyze customer queries
using natural language processing,

110
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:14,949
NLP, deliver instant responses,
suggest relevant products, and

111
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,149
even generate leads for sales team.

112
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,819
Let's look at two examples of
successful chatbot integration.

113
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,949
Sephora, the multinational beauty
retailer, successfully implemented the

114
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,049
chatbot in Facebook Messenger and Kik.

115
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,739
The Sephora Virtual Artist chatbot offers
personalized makeup recommendations,

116
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,229
allows users to virtually try on
products and provides beauty tips.

117
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:39,889
Results.

118
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,519
11 percent increase in booking
rates for makeover appointments,

119
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,079
and every user spent 10 minutes
engaging with the chatbot.

120
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:50,299
Very nice.

121
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:55,719
Luxury Escapes is one of the biggest
luxury travel agencies in Australia and

122
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,129
operates in 29 countries around the world.

123
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,809
Over 2 million visitors would check Luxury
Escapes website each month for new deals

124
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:09,659
and offers, but their company wanted to
improve the online customer experience.

125
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,319
Their goal was to offer more
personalization, a quicker way to

126
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,609
find deals and easier notifications.

127
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:20,619
To reach these goals, Luxury
Escapes partnered with Master of

128
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:25,309
Code to reinvent their shopping
experience in the form of AI chatbot.

129
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:30,969
Luxury Escapes achieved a 3x
conversion rate using AI chatbots,

130
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,229
generated 300, 000 in just 90 days.

131
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,789
This underscores their ROI of investing
in advanced segmentation tools.

132
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,089
Part 3.

133
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,629
Among other segmentations which
are used in product communications.

134
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,539
There can be a million of segmentations.

135
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,729
The main thing is the business goal.

136
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,819
Therefore, first of all, determine the
purpose for which you need segmentation.

137
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,239
On the slide, I gave three
examples of such purposes.

138
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,969
First one, increase the effect of
communication through personalization.

139
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,019
For example, women are more active
users of retail and Yandex food.

140
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,609
So we use this kind of
segmentation in our communications.

141
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,449
Second one, reduce the acquisition cost.

142
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:21,854
For example, it's necessary
to optimize expenses on a.

143
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,974
Expensive channels such as
SMS and the third reduce spam.

144
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:31,234
Do not spam the user If there are a
lot of products in your service, you

145
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:33,144
can't tell everyone about everything.

146
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:37,064
Let's look at the basic types of
segmentation There are some of

147
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:43,544
segmentation models demographic
Like age, gender, income, education,

148
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:45,524
profession, material status.

149
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:51,964
Geographical, like country, region,
city, district, and language.

150
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:58,244
Psychographic, values, interests,
incentives, pains, barriers.

151
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:03,264
Technographic, devices type,
operating system, applications.

152
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:07,894
Behavioral, history of using
products or service in your service.

153
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,074
Traffic source.

154
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:10,534
Interest based.

155
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,639
Products or services that customer
need or are interested in and

156
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,699
value based the economic value of
clients for business average bill.

157
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,789
And there are examples.

158
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:27,329
of two and three vector
segmentations that we use in Yandex.

159
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:34,339
RFM is created by recency, how long ago
was the user's last visit to the product,

160
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:39,889
frequency of the visits, and monetary,
how much money did the user bring.

161
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:44,409
And the second example is
NPS plus value segmentations.

162
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,719
Using these types of segmentations,
you will be able to understand

163
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:51,679
what kind of clients your
business currently consists of.

164
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,649
Here are three examples of using
different types of segmentation.

165
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,699
One of our main business tasks in
Super App Yandex Go is converting

166
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,619
taxi users into delivery users.

167
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,519
We have a problem with this task.

168
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:08,939
We cannot tech communicate with
all users of the super app.

169
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,119
There are two reasons for this.

170
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:15,339
We need to separate communication
with other services like Yandex

171
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,069
food or Yandex market within the
application so as not to spam users.

172
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:25,459
And if we talk about ordinary individuals
like you and me, the delivery service

173
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,309
is almost never needed at the moment.

174
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,369
It's needed if you forgot things.

175
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,719
At work, for example, or need to
send a friend, for example, a book.

176
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:39,659
So we integrated ML segmentation
to select only relevant users for

177
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:45,489
communications who are most likely
to need delivery in the near future.

178
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,919
On the graph, you can see the number of
users in the database, depending on the

179
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,659
relevance for delivery by ML scoring.

180
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:58,489
ML scoring is used in CRM
marketing for forecasts.

181
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:03,569
There can be forecast for the time
of the user's next order, for the

182
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:08,409
probability of churn, for products
that may be interested to the client.

183
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,059
And for the time of communication,
for example, and in search of new ways

184
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,219
to find relevant clients in Yandex
Go, we made segmentation based on the

185
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:22,219
points where the user is going by taxi
or where he is at the moment, like

186
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:27,359
geographical segmentation, imagine that
you're going to the hardware store,

187
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:32,199
you order a taxi and the moment while
you are driving information appears in

188
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:37,329
your application that if you have heavy
purchases, order a cargo service, if

189
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,379
you suddenly missed this communication.

190
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:43,764
When you get to the point B in five
minutes, you will receive a push

191
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,714
notification with this information.

192
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,974
And on the map in Yandex Go,
there will be a track like this.

193
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:54,694
Within the help of such segmentation,
we were able to increase orders

194
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,154
by 14 percent and this relevant.

195
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:58,254
places.

196
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,504
ML segmentation and Internet of
Things data allow businesses to

197
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,924
anticipate customer needs and
provide value ahead of time.

198
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:10,524
Internet of Things enables companies
to personalize communications by

199
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,634
leveraging real world usage data.

200
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,834
Let's look at some examples.

201
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:19,434
Smart speakers like
Amazon, Echo, Google Nest.

202
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:25,024
These devices collect behavioral
data like music preferences or voice

203
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:29,724
shopping habits to tailor marketing
communications such as personalized

204
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:32,164
offers via email or push notifications.

205
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:36,884
It gives an impact in increasing
email open rate by 50 percent

206
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,384
due to hyper personalization.

207
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,314
Fitness trackers like Garmin and Fitbit.

208
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:46,364
These devices send personalized
notification based on activity

209
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:51,564
data, like reminders for workouts
or sleeping improvement tips.

210
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,654
Boosting user engagement.

211
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,229
Impact is improved user retention rates by

212
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:57,929
25%.

213
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,519
Part four, future of
product communications.

214
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,479
There are my recommendations,
what to independently study.

215
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,129
These areas will be actively
developing next year.

216
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,809
First one, generative AI like chatGPT.

217
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,459
The second one, voice
search and optimization.

218
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,869
Third one, omni channel personalization.

219
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:22,769
It's an approach that leverage
algorithmic decision making.

220
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:29,404
Powered by real time customer data
across channels to deliver contextually

221
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:36,754
relevant experience to an individual
and any, all channels of their choosing.

222
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,544
AR powered products.

223
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:45,544
So Gartner reports that by 2025, 50
percent of product interactions will

224
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,854
happen through voice enabled devices.

225
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:49,084
Awesome.

226
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:54,044
And to summarize, embracing new
technologies is not just about

227
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:59,514
staying relevant, it's about exceeding
expectations, driving growth, and

228
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:04,454
creating meaningful connection with
your customers, communications drive

229
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:10,554
results when based by actionable data,
AI tools, streamline communication

230
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:13,054
workflows, and enhance personalizations.

231
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:17,644
Every segmentation strategy should
align with a clear business goal.

232
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:20,434
And that's all from me for now.

233
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:23,134
Thank you very much for
listening to my speech.

234
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:28,554
I hope it was useful for you and you will
enhance your product by communications.

235
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:34,074
