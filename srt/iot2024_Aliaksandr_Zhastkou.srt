1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,380
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,560
Thanks for joining my talk today.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,140
I hope you liked my intro from the Alps.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,660
It was quite cold there.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,260
My name is Alex.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,770
I am a product owner in Yandex.

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,439
Yandex is one of the largest tech
companies globally, providing a wide

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,979
range of services, including search
engines, maps, transportation, e commerce,

9
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:24,330
cloud computing, and AI technologies.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,440
I'm working on delivery service.

11
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,345
Today, I'm excited to share insights on
how new technologies are transforming

12
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:35,265
product communications, drawing
from my experience scaling Yandex

13
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,764
delivery and industry leading trends.

14
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,694
Few words about myself.

15
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:41,674
Years of experience.

16
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,294
Over seven years in
product communications.

17
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:45,844
Growth impact.

18
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:52,359
Contributed to the 100 growth of
Yandex delivery, user base, over 18

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,989
million users served in 4 years, global
reach, operating in 22 countries.

20
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,359
So why adopting new trends in
product communications matters?

21
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:07,969
McKinsey report that 35 percent
of Amazon's revenue is driven by

22
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,049
AI based product recommendations.

23
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,869
So the first reason is
Competitive advantage.

24
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:19,319
Salesforce report that 72 percent of
businesses using AI in communications

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,279
report higher customer retention.

26
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,479
Second one.

27
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,319
Customer expectations.

28
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:29,319
McKinsey report that 80 percent
of customers expect personalized

29
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,129
experience in every interaction.

30
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,149
Third one.

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,409
Efficiency gains.

32
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,614
HubSpot says that automating communication
reduces campaign launch time by 30

33
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:41,604
percent and operational cost by 20%.

34
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:44,564
Fourth, data driven decisions.

35
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:49,634
For example, Internet of Things
devices generate 90 zettabytes

36
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:53,454
of actionable data annually,
driving better customer insights.

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,024
And fifth, future proofing.

38
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,649
Gartner report that 96 percent of
companies plan to increase AI and

39
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,939
Internet of Things investments by 2025.

40
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,709
Our discussion will cover four
keys areas, understanding what

41
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,079
product communications are.

42
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:16,294
exploring how AI driven tools
enhance them and diving into

43
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,094
advanced segmentation methods.

44
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:21,484
Finally, we will look at
what the future holds.

45
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:25,964
Okay, let's start by defining
what product communications are.

46
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:31,495
Product communications focus on connecting
customer with the value of your product.

47
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,444
From emails to internet of
things enabled notifications.

48
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:40,389
Each channel serves to educate,
engage and convert users.

49
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,169
Here are some product
communications examples.

50
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:49,519
There are a large number of types of
communications like push notifications,

51
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:53,789
product recommendations, social
media communications, and chatbots.

52
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,649
By integrating customer data through
CRM systems, These communications

53
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,209
become more personalized and impactful.

54
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,519
When we hear about CRM marketing,
we associate it with different

55
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:12,869
words like spam, loyalty program,
email newsletter, CRM system, and

56
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,459
WhatsApp messenger, for example.

57
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,049
Let's figure out what CRM is.

58
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,419
CRM is Customer Relationship Management.

59
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,569
The first thesis for today Is
that CRM communications are

60
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,129
communications based on customer data.

61
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,179
In general, any promotion is based on
studying your audience, but CRM systems

62
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:34,999
take this process to a new level.

63
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:40,409
Imagine that you can build a sales
strategy, not on hypothesis or

64
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:46,279
assumptions, but on real information
about your customers, what, to whom, and

65
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,189
what point and through what channel to
offer in order to achieve conversion.

66
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,389
Let's look at how CRM helps to personalize
communication and get more sales.

67
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,849
Here are the channels commonly used.

68
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:03,344
Email, SMS, push notifications,
chatbots, or even Internet of Things.

69
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:07,124
Effective product communications
require selecting the right

70
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:10,034
channels to reach your audience.

71
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:15,824
From AI driven emails to Internet of
Things enabled reminders on smart devices,

72
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:20,554
the focus should always be on creating
a seamless personalized experience.

73
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:26,954
For example, a fitness tracker can send
personalized reminders Keeping users

74
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,504
engaged and boosting retention by 25%.

75
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,864
Part two, how AI driven
tools enhance communications.

76
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:37,264
If any of you are planning to work
in communications or are going to

77
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:42,594
connect an agency or hire a manager,
let's talk about stages in the

78
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:44,444
creation of product communications.

79
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:49,194
The communication process begin with
data collection and segmentation.

80
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:53,514
Move through strategy and
creative development and ends with

81
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,544
testing and performance analysis.

82
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,404
This structured approach.

83
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,779
insurance measurable outcomes.

84
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,679
Large CRM companies are increasingly
integrated AI technologies designed to

85
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:10,169
assist or even replace some of the tasks
traditionally performed by CRM marketers.

86
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:16,289
This AI driven system can analyze
user data, propose hypotheses, create

87
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,669
personalized communication strategy,
and conduct A B testing, making them

88
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,419
powerful tools in modern marketing.

89
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,349
Let's look at some examples.

90
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,109
Salesforce Einstein.

91
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:32,184
Salesforce has implemented AI capabilities
that automate tasks such as lead

92
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:36,374
prioritization, customer segmentation,
and personalized communication.

93
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:41,714
Einstein can analyze user behavior
and predict customer needs, enabling

94
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,524
marketers to act proactively.

95
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:48,659
Automation and self service technologies
can give business across all industry

96
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:52,879
a significant productivity boost,
generate cost savings, and an

97
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,659
increase in customer satisfaction.

98
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,219
Last year, customers using Salesforce
Service Cloud tools, including automation

99
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:06,179
and self service tools such as AI powered
chatbots, saw a 30 percent increase in

100
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:11,589
customer satisfaction, and more than 27
percent increase in agent productivity,

101
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:14,139
customer retention, and case resolution.

102
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:21,794
If you want to know about Salesforce
AI tools more, please find the

103
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:26,544
official Salesforce website where
you can find full information about

104
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,184
the tools and also try them yourself.

105
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,234
HubSpot AI tools are another examples.

106
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,660
HubSpot uses AI to power features
like content generation, automated

107
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,360
workflows, and predictive fleet scoring.

108
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,770
The system helps marketers identify trends
and optimize campaigns in real time.

109
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,580
One more example of AI chatbot.

110
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:55,070
HubSpot integrated AI chatbot into its CRM
to automate early customer interactions.

111
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,830
These bots analyze customer queries
using Natural Language Processing, NLP.

112
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,930
Deliver instant responses,
suggest relevant products, or even

113
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,110
generate leads for a sales team.

114
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,290
Nice.

115
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,429
Let's look at two examples of
successful chatbot integrations.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,610
Sephora, the multinational beauty
retailer, successfully implemented the

117
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,640
chatbot in Facebook Messenger and Kik.

118
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,330
The Sephora virtual artist chatbot offers
personalized makeup recommendations,

119
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,879
allows users to virtually try on
products and provides beauty tips.

120
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,690
Result 11 percent increase in booking
rates for makeover appointments.

121
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,099
Average user spent 10 minutes
engaging with the chatbot.

122
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,079
The second example Luxury Escapes
is one of the biggest luxury travel

123
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,469
agencies in Australia and operates
in 29 countries around the world.

124
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:59,749
Over 2 million visitors would check Luxury
Escapes website each month for new deals.

125
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:04,844
and offers, but, but the company wanted
to improve the online customer experience.

126
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:09,394
Their goal was to offer more
personalization, a quicker way to

127
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:11,614
find deals and easy notifications.

128
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,814
To reach these goals, Luxury
Escapes partnered with Master of

129
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:21,064
Code to reinvent their shopping
experience in the form of AI chatbot.

130
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:26,649
Luxury escapes achieved a 3x
conversion rate using a iChat bot,

131
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,739
generated 300, 000 in just 90 days.

132
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:36,799
This underscores the ROI of investing
in advanced communication tools.

133
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:42,139
Part three, ML and other segmentation
which are used in product communications.

134
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,879
There can be a millions of segmentation,
but my main thing is the business goal.

135
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,949
Therefore, first of all, determine the
purpose for which you need segmentation.

136
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,189
On the slide, I gave three
examples of such purposes.

137
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:01,319
The first one, increase the effect of
communications through personalization.

138
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,949
For example, women are more active
users of retail and Yandex food.

139
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,809
So we use this kind of
segmentation in our communications.

140
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,819
Second one, reduce the acquisition cost.

141
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,379
For example, it's necessary to
optimize expenses on expensive SMS.

142
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,879
And third one, reduce spam.

143
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,449
Do not spam the user.

144
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,214
If you're, if there are a lot of
products in your service, You can't

145
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,904
tell everyone about everything.

146
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:32,604
So use segmentation.

147
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:37,894
Let's look at basic types of segmentations
There are some of segmentation models

148
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:43,884
The first one is demographic like age,
gender, income, education, profession,

149
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:46,154
material status Geographical.

150
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:50,604
Country, region, city, district,
and language, for example.

151
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:52,184
Psychographic.

152
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,694
Values, interests,
incentives, pains, barriers.

153
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:57,434
Technographic.

154
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,524
Devices, type, operating
system, applications.

155
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:01,874
Behavioral.

156
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:05,434
History of using products
or service in your service.

157
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:06,324
Traffic source.

158
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:07,704
Interest based.

159
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:12,064
Products or services that customers
need or are interested in.

160
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:13,884
Value based.

161
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,804
The economic value of
clients for business.

162
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,129
Average bill and so on.

163
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,269
And there are examples of two and three
vector segmentation that we use in Yandex.

164
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,379
RFM segmentation is created by
recency, how long ago was the user's

165
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:36,999
last visit to the product, frequency
of the visits, And monetary, how

166
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,729
much money did the user bring?

167
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,869
And the second example is
NPS plus value segmentations.

168
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,719
Using these types of segmentation,
you will be able to understand

169
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,589
what kind of clients your
business currently consists of.

170
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,389
Here are three examples of using
different types of segmentation.

171
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:58,609
One of our main business tasks in
Super App Yandex Go is converting

172
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,039
taxi users into delivery users.

173
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,199
We have a problem with this task.

174
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:07,979
We cannot take and communicate
with all users on the super app.

175
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,859
There are two reasons for this.

176
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:15,024
We need to separate communication
with other services, like Yandex Food,

177
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,634
Yandex Market, within the application.

178
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:22,384
as not to spam users and if we talk
about ordinary individuals like

179
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:26,924
you and me, the delivery service is
almost never needed at the moment.

180
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,159
It's needed if you forgot things at work,
for example, or need to send a friend,

181
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,669
for example, a game console or a book.

182
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,029
So we integrated ML segmentation
to select only relevant users for

183
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,699
communications who are mostly like
to need delivery in the near future.

184
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,869
On the graph, you can see the number of
users in the database, depending on the

185
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,279
relevance for delivery by ML scoring.

186
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,889
ML scoring is used in CRM
marketing for forecast.

187
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:02,909
There can be forecast for the time
of the user's next order, for their

188
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,059
probability of churn, For products
that may be interested to the client

189
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,689
for the time of communication.

190
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,189
In search of new ways to find
relevant clients in Yandex Go, we

191
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,549
made segmentation based on the points
where the user is going to, going by

192
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:21,709
taxi or where he is at the moment.

193
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,419
Geo segmentation.

194
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,249
Imagine that you are
going to a hardware store.

195
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,529
You order a taxi and at that moment
while you are driving information appears

196
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,839
in your application that if you have
heavy purchases, order a cargo service.

197
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,619
If you suddenly miss this
communication, when you get to the

198
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:45,449
point B, in five minutes you will
receive a push notification with this

199
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,489
information and on the map in Yandex
Go There will be a track like this.

200
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:55,149
With the help of such segmentation,
we were able to increase orders by

201
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,659
40 percent in these relevant places.

202
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,189
ML segmentation and Internet of
Things data allow businesses to

203
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:05,789
anticipate customer needs and
provide value ahead of time.

204
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,719
Internet of Things enables companies
to personalize communications by re,

205
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,129
re, leveraging real world usage data.

206
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,379
Let's look at some examples.

207
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:20,294
Some smart speakers like
Amazon Echo, Google Nest.

208
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:22,404
These devices collect behavioral data.

209
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:28,629
like music preferences or voice
shopping habits to tailor marketing

210
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:33,409
communications such as personalized
offers via email or push notifications.

211
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,279
It gives an impact in increasing
email open rates by 50 percent

212
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,029
due to hyper personalization.

213
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:40,399
Nice.

214
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:41,899
Fitness trackers.

215
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,429
Garmin or Fitbit.

216
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:47,039
This device is sent personalized
notification based on activity

217
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,179
data, reminders for workouts
or sleep improvement tips,

218
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,419
boosting user engagement.

219
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:58,509
Impact is improved user
retention rate by 25%.

220
00:13:59,109 --> 00:13:59,769
very nice.

221
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,969
Part four, future of
product communications.

222
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:06,989
There are my recommendations
what to independently study.

223
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,029
These areas will be actively
developing next year.

224
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:14,084
The first one is generative
AI like child GPT.

225
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,894
Second one is voice search optimization.

226
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,124
Third one, omni channel personalization.

227
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,924
It's an approach that leverages
algorithmic decision making, powered

228
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:30,554
by real time customer data across
channels, to deliver a contextually

229
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:36,314
relevant experience to an individual on
any and all channels of their choosing.

230
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,244
And the last one is, AR powered products.

231
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:47,764
Gartner's report that by 2025, 50
percent of product interactions will

232
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,964
happen through voice enabled devices.

233
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:54,604
So to summarize, embracing
new technologies isn't just

234
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:55,924
about staying relevant.

235
00:14:56,324 --> 00:15:02,004
It's about exceeding expectation,
driving growth and creating meaningful

236
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,844
connections with your customers.

237
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,514
Communications drive results.

238
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,054
When based by actionable data.

239
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:15,594
AI tools streamline communication work
workflows and enhance personalization.

240
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:20,094
Every segmentation strategy should
align with a clear business goal.

241
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,274
And that's all from me for today.

242
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,624
Thank you very much for
listening to my speech.

243
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:31,864
