00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,270
Hello everyone, this is Praveen.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,780
Today my topic of discussion is how
artificial intelligence and machine

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,690
learning are creating transformative
impact in the life and nanotech space

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,399
and how these life insurance companies
are using these two advanced technologies

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,249
in predicting consumer behavior.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,724
And also using different data
and doing consumer analysis.

7
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:26,895
So without any further delay, let's
get started So first, let's talk about

8
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:30,804
what is life and annuities industry
So the life and annuities industry

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,035
is a significant component of the u.

10
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,574
s economy and also the u.

11
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:39,545
s financial sector Which actually provides
long term risk management services and

12
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:44,605
also investment options to the consumers
So in this way, the consumers can actually

13
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:49,825
invest their own money into these life
insurance policies or different indexes.

14
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,065
And after a certain period of
time, they get investment returns.

15
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:56,025
Which in turn they can
plan for different reasons.

16
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:00,945
It might be retirement or it might be
For some college tuition expenses for

17
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:05,475
the decades or for a different set of
reasons So they have different plans

18
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:10,295
which are actually sponsored by these
life insurance companies And the consumers

19
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:14,870
can actually invest their money Spying
these policies and investing into

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,870
stocks and indexes which are tied to
this particular policies what are the

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,050
critical areas of a life and energy space?

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,770
So there are two different areas, which
are very critical in terms of Directly

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,510
impacting the operational efficiency
and customer loyalty of a particular

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,950
process in a life insurance company So
the first day is the claims processing.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,050
The second day is the customer experience.

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,440
So these two are the two critical
areas which have a direct impact on

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,360
the operational efficiency and customer
loyalty of a particular life and entities

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,070
carrier or life insurance company, within
the U S so our next topic is, what is

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,550
the role of artificial intelligence and
machine learning in modernizing insurance?

30
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,669
So artificial intelligence and machine
learning are reshaping the L& A space.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,400
by automating so much of, repetitive
tasks, which requires human interactions

32
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,370
in the day to day operational
processing of different patterns

33
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,950
of data and predictive analytics.

34
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,300
So by using of AI and ML, we are
having to achieve an operational

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,220
efficiency by automating so
much of tasks, which actually.

36
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:28,915
It helps these industries in
optimizing the process, removing

37
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,095
any manual and human intervention.

38
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:35,855
And also it also helps in detecting
anomalies and analyzing customer behavior.

39
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:39,695
So this is, this actually will
cause, a different approach of

40
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:43,455
how we have the perspective of
looking at particular things, right?

41
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:46,295
So by introduction of
these two technologies.

42
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,575
The shift is changing from
being a reactive process, right?

43
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:54,595
Instead of being respond, instead of
responding to something will be turned

44
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:59,275
on the proactive mode of management,
which is basically it enables a more

45
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:04,185
responsive insurance model and these
two advanced technologies, which is

46
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:08,319
artificial intelligence and machine
learning also helps insurers and.

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,660
to optimize their operations and
create personalized user experience,

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,350
thereby enhancing both efficiency
and customer satisfaction.

49
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,830
let's take a case of claims
processing wherein we used artificial

50
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,570
intelligence and machine learning
to do automation and efficiency.

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,760
there are different tasks or
there are different steps in the

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,290
claims management process, right?

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,830
once after you get a claim, you
are, you have to, Go through a

54
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,550
lot of documentation, which is
received on the claim, right?

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,590
And you have to review the documentation
for accuracy You have to review the

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,630
documentation to see if there is any
fraud involved and you also need to

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,590
do a different types of data analysis
and Check to make sure that whatever

58
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,090
information is received on a claim is
correct before it is processed, right?

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,830
So all these different steps, right the
step one is basically We can automate

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,270
all these four different steps of
claims processing using artificial

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,750
intelligence and machine learning.

62
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,150
So first, the first step is we
can actually automate the whole

63
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,430
document handling, meaning the AI
will actually extract and processes

64
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,260
information from claims documents,
which will actually reduce the,

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,720
excuse me, the manual data entry.

66
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,110
The second step is anomaly detection.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,345
So the machine learning models Are
very efficient in identifying patterns

68
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:29,355
that may indicate that if it is a
fraudulent claim or it's actually a

69
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:33,365
genuine claim, if it's a fraud fraudulent
claim, then it allows insurance

70
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:37,905
companies to take early intervention
steps from being from the claim being

71
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:42,755
processed and the money going out of
the door and then predictive analytics.

72
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:47,565
So artificial intelligence also
predicts claims resolution times, right?

73
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:50,605
Because we have different
requirements For different states

74
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,065
and how we process these claims.

75
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:57,165
So by using the automation and AI We can
make sure that all these requirements

76
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:01,675
are met enabling efficient allocation
of claims processing within a stipulated

77
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:07,380
period of time thereby increasing consumer
satisfaction and then the impact right

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,010
the faster the claims resolution is the
lower we have overhead cost or operational

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,850
cost because We are if the process is all
automated and then there is also reduced

80
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,624
risk of fraud and you know the And there
is also improved customer experience

81
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:28,810
because of all the efficiencies which we
gain By using the ai and machine learning

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,560
models, you know in the claims processing
for a particular life and energy company

83
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,890
In this way it directly impacts the
consumer satisfaction thereby improving

84
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,800
customer loyalty for a particular company.

85
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,810
Okay, how do we use?

86
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,590
Ai and ml in identifying consumer
behavior analysis, right?

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,030
So it is actually used
across four different topics.

88
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,945
One is the data analysis Second is
the proactive engagement And Third is

89
00:05:54,955 --> 00:06:00,355
the personalized offerings and fourth
is the result how do we use the data

90
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,065
what we get from the customer, right?

91
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:06,145
So the machine learning algorithms
what they do is like they analyze

92
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:10,135
large data sets to identify What
is the pattern of consumers?

93
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:14,295
What they are wanting to purchase
the different customer preferences

94
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,915
and the behavior patterns, right?

95
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:21,335
So this will actually help all the life
and analytic Companies who are using

96
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:25,865
this machine learning and artificial
intelligent tools to predict consumer

97
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,555
behavior you know, this actually helps
them to tailor insurance products

98
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:34,805
and Go to market strategies to make
sure that they are meeting individual

99
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:39,415
customer needs And this also in fact
That turns up into the proactive

100
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:43,405
engagement of the companies because all
this is predictive analytics, right?

101
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,025
This is all predictive in nature.

102
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:50,595
So all the insights, what we receive from
the data processing using the algorithms

103
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:55,575
actually help the insurance companies
anticipate and address potential customer

104
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:58,165
issues even before they get, escalated.

105
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,645
And as a result of all this,
we see that there is an

106
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,465
increased customer satisfaction.

107
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,470
we have better retention rates and
higher conversion of the personalized

108
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,810
product, offerings from the customers
to the company, ultimately leading

109
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,900
to an increase in sales and customer
loyalty for a particular insurance

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,420
company from the customers.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,710
So what are the benefits and challenges
of, Adoption of AI or ML, right?

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,320
So the benefits are as we know as
we already spoke about It actually

113
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,250
enhances operational capability.

114
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,500
It improves operational efficiency in a
particular process by automation and the

115
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,040
accuracy of the claims processing and the
fraud detection is also improved because

116
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,525
We are using artificial intelligence
and machine learning In detecting and

117
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:47,065
reviewing all these incoming documents
and information Thereby if there is any

118
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:51,545
fraud detected or if there is anomaly,
which is detected We can it gets

119
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:55,985
reported immediately and the insurance
company can take intervention steps

120
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,765
as a precautionary measure in being
productive in nature rather than being

121
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:04,405
reactive And it also elevates customer
satisfaction because we are creating

122
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:09,620
products which are custom made or which
are mostly here Tailored products for

123
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,560
customer needs and behavior patterns.

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,280
So these are the main different benefits
what we achieve by using artificial

125
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,730
intelligence and machine learning
and adopting them, in predicting

126
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,460
customer behavior and patterns.

127
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,850
So what are the challenges?

128
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:27,695
So the data privacy concerns and
compliance with different regulations

129
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:33,255
is a key challenge because the way we
accept data, the way we gather data,

130
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:37,355
the way we process data, so these are
all driven by so many regulations.

131
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:42,580
So we have to make sure that all the data
privacy concerns are up to the mark, and

132
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,740
we are following all the state regulated
or the federal regulated, policies or

133
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,750
standards for the process and gather data.

134
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,850
And it's always a challenge because
whenever we introduce a new technology

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,130
in an existing ecosystem, there are
a large legacy systems dependencies,

136
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
which we have to take care before we
get introduced to this new technologies.

137
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,270
Because.

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,470
The solutioning of these new technologies
and integration with legacy systems might

139
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,910
be a big challenge because there might
be huge chunks of data which are actually

140
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,540
processed through these legacy systems.

141
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,060
And since they are built and these
are age old systems, we have to

142
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,360
make sure that, all these systems
are working from the same component

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,900
or the same integration plane.

144
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,635
So that there is smoother
processing of data.

145
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:31,175
And, as we all know, another big
challenge is finding talent who

146
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:35,935
can actually support the AI or ML
technologies in this market is a little

147
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:41,055
bit, challenging because, these are new
technologies and finding resources with

148
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,435
ample experiences who, skilled people.

149
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:48,485
To develop deploy and manage these
technologies will be a true challenge

150
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:52,565
let's now look at few industry
case studies So i'll be walking

151
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:54,595
you guys through a few examples.

152
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:58,855
The first example is there was this
particular company a which actually

153
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:05,605
implemented Ai in their claims processing
system and it outrightly You know reduce

154
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:11,545
the claims processing system by 60 percent
and it also decreased the fraud losses by

155
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,495
30 percent Something similar, excuse me.

156
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,515
Something similar is was used at
company B Where we used machine language

157
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:23,085
to analyze the customer data and
personalize their offerings resulting

158
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:27,845
in a 20 percent increase in policy
renewals So the key takeaway here is

159
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:31,295
these are real world examples, which
are highlighting the importance of

160
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:35,795
AI and ML You And their potential to
deliver the measurable business outcomes

161
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:40,045
for a particular insurance company
or a particular insurance carrier So

162
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:44,395
let's talk about the road map of ai
or ml integration and life insurance.

163
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:50,195
So before we actually have a
Have an idea of implementing

164
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,555
Artificial intelligence and machine
learning in a particular company.

165
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:58,165
I would think we need to go through four
different phases So phase one is basically

166
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:02,910
assessment and strategy development and
Phase two is what I call pilot projects.

167
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,070
Phase three is full scale implementation.

168
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,550
Phase four is continuous optimization.

169
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,990
So in the phase one, we need to identify
what kind of artificial intelligence

170
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,225
and machine learning use cases We
need to implement these models so

171
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,445
that, these are aligned with the
business goals of a particular company.

172
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:25,225
In the phase two, we might have
to pick a small sample from the

173
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:29,425
identified use cases across different
capabilities within a company in

174
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,945
order to validate effectiveness.

175
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:34,745
And, we have to make adjustments because
this is more of a proof of concept

176
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,065
model before we go full scale, right?

177
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:40,935
So the phase two for me is more of a
proof of concept model, where we have to

178
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:45,235
pick a particular couple of business use
cases, and then we have to make sure that

179
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:49,935
we are building the artificial AI or ML
models, and we have to deploy them to see

180
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:53,615
if it works and if they are aligned with
the business objectives of the company.

181
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:57,745
So once that POC is successful, then
we move on to phase three, which

182
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:59,305
is the full scale implementation.

183
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,685
So now the full scale implementation
is going big bang, right?

184
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:06,345
So we have to roll out the AI
or ML across the organization.

185
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:10,075
We have to integrate this with different
systems, the core insurance processing

186
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:14,195
systems, and there's the big part of
the big bang approach or the full scale

187
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:15,975
implementation is a training aspect of it.

188
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:21,125
So training the people to use this
AI or ML is a key aspect because even

189
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,655
though we have the systems in place.

190
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,560
If the people or the resources who
are using the systems are not skilled

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,520
enough, are not trained enough,
then I think we can't really get the

192
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,060
efficiencies out of these systems.

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,600
And the phase four is what we
call as continuous optimization.

194
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,250
So we have to make sure that these
models or the AI or ML models

195
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,610
are trained regularly, refined
regularly, all these algorithms are

196
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,590
clarified and refined regularly.

197
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,580
In that way, it gives us the
scalability to expand the AI or ML.

198
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:55,875
As technology advances and we gather
more data So these are the four

199
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:01,105
different steps wherein we integrate
AI or ML in the life insurance company

200
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,785
So what are the future
trends and opportunities?

201
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:08,395
So I think there are a couple of
topics which are very interesting

202
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,975
here to talk about One is what I
call is conversational AI, right?

203
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:16,925
So we can leverage AI powered chatbots
for customer services To resolve queries

204
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:20,895
quickly and efficiently So gone are
those days wherein people have to wait

205
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,895
For the customer, consumer hours, right?

206
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,835
To call into the call center
from nine to five or the regular

207
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,985
business hours today by using AI.

208
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,690
The chatbot is available 24 by 7
and 95 percent of the time all the

209
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,610
questions are answered using the
chatbot and it's very user friendly.

210
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,470
And it's, since it's AI powered, the
customer service factor also increases

211
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,320
because they, all the customers who are
using this chatbots are getting their

212
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,270
answers immediately without having to
actually wait to speak to a person.

213
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,350
And real time risk assessment.

214
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,740
So we can use AI to assess risks on the
fly and adjust the policies dynamically.

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,610
Thank you.

216
00:13:57,185 --> 00:14:01,155
And AI underwriting, AI plays a
big part today in automating the

217
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:06,425
underwriting process, which in turn is
reducing the turnaround times to issue

218
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,975
a particular life insurance policy.

219
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,655
And how can we expand
AI or ML applications?

220
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:15,875
We can continue to explore new
use cases, such as dynamic pricing

221
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,775
or consumer sentiment analysis
and intelligent automation.

222
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,495
In that way, we can actually predict
consumer behavior and we can create

223
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,425
products which are tailored to
consumer needs and preferences.

224
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:32,335
So just to conclude about what we have
talked about so far, the artificial

225
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:36,795
intelligence and machine learning are
in fact creating waves in life and

226
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:41,785
analytics industry, addressing the
longstanding challenges while creating new

227
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,425
opportunities for growth and innovation.

228
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,945
Especially in the claims processing,
the companies, the life of nanotech

229
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:52,125
carriers can significantly improve
operational efficiency, they can

230
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:54,095
reduce the cost and mitigate fraud.

231
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:58,875
On the other hand, AI and ML's
impact on consumer behavior analysis

232
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,505
is transforming the way insurers
engage with their customers.

233
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,605
By leveraging this advanced data
insights and data analytics.

234
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,220
The companies can gain a deeper
understanding into what the customers

235
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,570
are wanting, what are their preferences
and what are the needs enabling them

236
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,270
to create personalized products.

237
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,260
This proactive approach leads to be better
customer retention, higher satisfaction,

238
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,300
stronger brand loyalty, and also will
place a particular life insurance company

239
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,470
to be the market leader for decades.

240
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,760
thank you for giving me this
opportunity to talk to you guys.

241
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,790
