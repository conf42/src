1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello everyone, welcome.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,460
Today we are diving into one of the
most important shifts in cyber security,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,900
which is zero trust architecture.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,049
With the explosion of cloud services,
remote work, and an increasing

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,219
number of cyber threats, we need to
rethink how we approach security.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,509
This talk is going to explore why
the old ways of securing our networks

7
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:28,419
no longer work, and how zero trust
is reshaping the future of security.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,320
Here's a quick roadmap of what
we'll be diving into today.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,759
First, I'll give you an introduction
to Zero Trust and why it's essential

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,699
in today's cybersecurity landscape.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,809
We'll then break down the core principles,
compare traditional security models with

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,190
Zero Trust, and explore the key components
and strategies for implementation.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,880
After that, I'll walk you through
the challenges, the future of

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,299
this architecture, and wrap up
with some real world case studies.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,490
All right, let's get started.

16
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:05,019
Why are we talking about Zero Trust today?

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,710
The traditional parameter based
security models have worked for

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,289
years with a simple principle.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,799
Build a strong perimeter and
everything inside is trusted.

20
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,609
But here's the problem.

21
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,429
We don't live in that world anymore.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,389
With workforces, SaaS applications
and IoT devices constantly connecting

23
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:28,774
and disconnecting, Their network is
no longer a neatly defined space.

24
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:34,234
Attackers can breach that perimeter and
in ways we didn't anticipate back then.

25
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:41,184
They can exploit weak VPN configuration,
poorly secured APIs, or even something

26
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:43,764
as small as a compromised IoT device.

27
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,004
This is where Zero Trust comes into play.

28
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,924
Zero Trust doesn't assume
anyone or anything is safe.

29
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:54,104
It shifts our narrative to
never trust, always verify.

30
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,755
Every request, whether it's internal
or external, gets scrutinized.

31
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:03,815
Every user, device, and even the
application must authenticate

32
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:05,335
before access is granted.

33
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,304
Zero trust is not just about
keeping the bad guys out, it's

34
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,685
about constantly questioning who
and what is allowed in and why.

35
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:16,835
Now let's break this down.

36
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,374
The fundamental principle
of zero trust is simple.

37
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:22,915
Never trust, always verify.

38
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,865
What does that mean in technical terms?

39
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:30,565
It means that every single access
request is evaluated on multiple

40
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:35,855
factors, regardless of where the
request originates, inside or outside

41
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,535
the traditional network perimeter.

42
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,354
Continuous authentication is crucial here.

43
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:44,545
For example, even after logging
in, the system continuously

44
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,465
checks if the session is valid.

45
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:50,615
Looking at the device health,
location, user behavior, and

46
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,415
other context based parameters.

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,880
We are not just stopping at
username and password anymore.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,240
We are checking things like whether
the device is jailbroken, whether

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,960
the session request is coming from
the unusual geographical location,

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,159
or whether the user's behavior
matches the normal patterns or not.

51
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,980
Then we have micro segmentation.

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,720
Then this involves breaking up the
network into smaller isolated zones, where

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,950
traffic can be scrutinized in real time.

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,650
Think of it as creative virtual
firewalls between different

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,060
parts of your environment.

56
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,860
If a thread gains access to one
segment, it's trapped there.

57
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,290
If it can't move, literally and of course
least privileged access is non negotiable.

58
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,689
In a zero trust model, users
and devices are only given the

59
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,260
minimal permissions they need.

60
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,159
This way, even if an attacker gains
an access, their impact is limited.

61
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,370
Traditional security versus zero
trust Out with the old in with the

62
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,203
new So let's take a look at how zero
trust contrasts with the traditional

63
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:06,424
security models in traditional perimeter
security ways So in an old way, trust

64
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:08,325
was implicit inside the network.

65
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,204
Once someone was inside, they
could move around freely.

66
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:15,524
The problem here is that this model
relies on a strong outer defense.

67
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:20,154
But once that's breached, attackers
can move literally within your network.

68
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,044
Compromising multiple systems.

69
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,414
Think about it like this.

70
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:28,065
If one system gets compromised
in a traditional setup, you

71
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,424
could lose the whole network.

72
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:33,044
In Zero Trust, we turn
that approach on its head.

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,310
Instead of relying on network
location as the basis for the trust,

74
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,440
we shift focus to identity, device
posture and contextual signals.

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,680
For example, when a user requests
access to sensitive data, we don't

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,619
check, just check their identity.

77
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,990
We also look at the security
posture of the device they're using.

78
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,620
Is the device patched?

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,420
Is it running an up to
date version of the OS?

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
what is its current security status?

81
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,895
We even consider the user's behavior.

82
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:05,415
Are they accessing data in
ways they normally wouldn't?

83
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:08,285
We call this risk based
access control model.

84
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,925
And it's a game changer for detecting
anomalies and threats in real time.

85
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:18,075
what are the key components
of ZTA implementation?

86
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:21,195
Now, how do we put this into practice?

87
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:26,435
let's break down the key components of
a successful Zero Trust implementation.

88
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,085
First up is identity
and access management.

89
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:33,784
IAM isn't just about usernames
and passwords anymore.

90
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:37,575
We are talking about multi
factor authentication tied into a

91
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:43,094
centralized identity provider that
controls access to all resources.

92
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:49,675
You'll also want to implement single sign
on or you know in SSO to streamline access

93
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,705
management but with continuous validation.

94
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:57,919
So even if a user signs in
through SSO, they are revaluated

95
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,799
continuously throughout their session.

96
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,370
Next, micro segmentation.

97
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,730
think of this deploying virtual
private zones within your network.

98
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,859
We use tools like Software
Defined Networking, SDN, or

99
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Network Access Control, NAC,
to isolate critical resources.

100
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,860
For instance, Instead of monolithic
flat network, we are now creating micro

101
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,780
perimeters around sensitive assets,
such as databases, applications,

102
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,750
and even individual workloads.

103
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,389
Then there's behavioral analytics.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,099
This is where machine learning
and AI comes in, constantly

105
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,499
monitoring user and device behavior.

106
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,239
It's no longer just about someone is
accessing, but how they are accessing it.

107
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:45,895
AI can identify unusual behavior
patterns and trigger alerts

108
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,305
before a breach happens.

109
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:51,154
Finally, we have policy
enforcement points or PEPs.

110
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:55,145
These are the checkpoints within
the network where all traffic

111
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,585
is validated against security
policies before moving further.

112
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:04,095
We enforce security policies
at network layer, application

113
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,575
layer, and even user layer.

114
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:11,805
Using tools like Next Gen Firewalls,
IDEAs, IPS, and Security Web Gateways.

115
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:16,335
So next one is the
implementation strategies.

116
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,675
Let's talk about strategy.

117
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,055
How do we actually implement Zero Trust?

118
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:24,554
first you want to nail down your
identity and access management.

119
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:29,484
This is where MFA or Multi Factor
Authentication becomes your best friend.

120
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:33,074
Because passwords alone just
aren't cutting it anymore.

121
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,534
Then move on to microsegmentation.

122
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:40,739
You can use tools like VMware,
NSX CSOs, application centric

123
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,999
infrastructure to implement
software defined microsegmentation.

124
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,769
These tools allow you to create
granular policies that govern how

125
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,139
workloads can interact with one another.

126
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,059
You could, for example, restrict
access so that your finance department

127
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,809
can't communicate with HR system
unless it's absolutely necessary.

128
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,329
Policy enforcement is next.

129
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,999
Implement next gen firewalls, secure
web gateways, and intrusion detection

130
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,899
systems at every layer of your network.

131
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,379
These tools continuously enforce your
security policies, ensuring that no

132
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,079
unauthorized traffic makes it through.

133
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:24,669
You can use orchestration platforms
like Palo Alto Networks or Fortinet

134
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,859
to streamline this process and ensure
that security policies are updated.

135
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,164
automatically as the new threats emerge.

136
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,844
So what are the challenges
and considerations?

137
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:39,814
Of course, implementing Zero Trust
isn't without its challenges.

138
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:44,394
One of the biggest hurdles
is resistance to change.

139
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:48,824
Your users and even IT staff may push back
on the idea of continuous authentication

140
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,134
because it feels cumbersome.

141
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,414
That's where user education comes in.

142
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:58,164
Helping everyone understand
that the extra steps are about

143
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,904
keeping the network secure.

144
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,554
Then there's technical complexity.

145
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:06,084
Many organizations have legacy
systems that weren't designed

146
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,834
with Zero Trust in mind.

147
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:11,054
Integrating these older
systems with modern Zero Trust

148
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,654
components can be difficult.

149
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:19,604
For instance, if authentication
or micro segmentation, you may

150
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:23,624
need to either update it or deploy
workarounds like virtual patching.

151
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:29,399
Our network level access controls, latency
and performance can also be a concern.

152
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:34,879
Continuous verification can slow down
workflows if not optimized correctly.

153
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:40,339
To mitigate this, we need to ensure
that our network infrastructure is

154
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:44,449
built to handle the additional checks
without introducing significant lag.

155
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,039
Finally, let's talk cost.

156
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,549
Implementing zero trust
requires investment.

157
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:53,994
Not just in technology, but also in
training, processes, and possibly

158
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,094
even, infrastructure redesign.

159
00:09:56,214 --> 00:10:00,064
But remember, the long term
security benefits are far

160
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,674
outweigh the upfront costs.

161
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:06,834
So what is the future of
Zero Trust Architecture?

162
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:12,444
The integration of artificial intelligence
and machine learning is going to play a

163
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:15,664
huge role in the evolution of Zero Trust.

164
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:20,924
AI will help us automate threat
detection, allowing the system to

165
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:24,784
make real time decisions about who
and what is allowed in the process.

166
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,934
Imagine AI driven systems that can
dynamically adjust security policies

167
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:32,384
based on new threats as they emerge.

168
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,104
Then there's blockchain technology.

169
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:38,904
Blockchain could be used to
create decentralized identity

170
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,904
systems, making it even harder for
attackers to impersonate users.

171
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:47,674
By eliminating the need for central
authorities in authentication, blockchain

172
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:52,284
will help reduce the risk of single points
of failure in identity management system.

173
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,534
Quantum computing is another
future consideration.

174
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:02,114
As quantum computing becomes more
powerful, our current cryptographic

175
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:04,064
algorithms will become obsolete.

176
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:10,354
Zero trust will need to evolve to include
quantum resistant encryption methods to

177
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,414
protect against quantum level threats.

178
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:16,824
And of course, with more businesses
moving to cloud and edge computing,

179
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:21,714
Zero Trust will need to scale to
provide lightweight, flexible security

180
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,374
for these distributed infrastructures.

181
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:29,414
so next, the case studies
and industry trends.

182
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,924
Let's look at how Zero Trust is
being used successfully today.

183
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,554
For example, in the U.

184
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:35,694
S.

185
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:39,224
government, several agencies
have adopted Zero Trust as part

186
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:41,054
of their cybersecurity strategy.

187
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,639
By continuously monitoring
insider activity, they have

188
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,009
been able to drastically reduce
the risk of insider threats.

189
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,739
On the enterprise side, companies
in the finance and healthcare

190
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,409
sectors have reported a significant
drop in breach incidents since

191
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,189
adopting Zero Trust principles.

192
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,189
Regulatory pressures like GDPR
and HIPAA are also pushing more

193
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,409
organizations towards Zero Trust models.

194
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,389
The numbers are clear.

195
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,269
Zero Trust is more than a trend.

196
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,789
It's becoming an industry standard.

197
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,339
So here's the bottom line.

198
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,689
Zero trust architecture is
the future of cyber security.

199
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,819
We can't rely on traditional
perimeter defenses anymore.

200
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:25,059
They just don't cut it in
today's threat landscape.

201
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,199
ZTE with its continuous authentication,
micro segmentation and least

202
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,329
privilege access is way forward.

203
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:39,439
Yes, implementing it can be challenging,
but the benefits far outweigh the hurdles.

204
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:39,644
That's ZTE.

205
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:43,674
By embracing Zero Trust, you're not
just protecting your organization

206
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:49,144
from today's threats, you're future
proofing it for whatever comes next.

207
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:53,804
It's time to take the leap and make Zero
Trust part of your security strategy.

208
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,944
So yeah, thank you so much for your time.

209
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:05,154
Zero Trust is the future and we are all in
this together and make your organization

210
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:07,074
stronger, smarter, and more secure.

211
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:11,474
Let's go out and build the
future of cyber security today.

212
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:12,804
Thank you.
