00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
PA Perva.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,620
I'm a strategy leader in the finance
industry, and today I'll be talking

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,350
to you about scaling AI and finance.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,350
With the focus on ML ops strategies,
which are behind the 70.86 billion

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,110
market transformation, we focus on how
production rate ML ops infrastructure

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,920
is enabling financial institutions
to deploy reliable, compliant, and

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,780
profitable AI and systems in the world.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,580
Most regulated industry.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,049
Let's quickly talk through the
financial revolution and the

10
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,189
detailed numbers behind it.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,199
85% of the financial institutions
are deploying AI systems today,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,920
transforming everything from risk
assessment to customer service.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,720
78.6, a number I previously
mentioned is the market size.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,000
Buy 2030 for this industry.

15
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:48,004
This is the projected value of
AI applications in financial

16
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:51,425
services representing massive
investment in infrastructure.

17
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:52,675
Thousand plus.

18
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:56,425
That's a big number, but those are the
credit variables that are processed

19
00:00:56,425 --> 00:01:01,254
in real time by modern financial
ML systems for decision making, and

20
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,675
then millions of daily transactions
happen, and those are analyzed by

21
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:08,695
fraud detection AI with required
high accuracy and minimal latency.

22
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,925
Latency just meets the
time required to do those.

23
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:16,145
As you can see then financial institutions
aren't just experimenting with ai.

24
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:19,655
They're deploying at scale and then
driving a fundamental transformation

25
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,515
of the industry core operations.

26
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:26,365
For today's agenda, we will focus
on ML ops of financial industry.

27
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:27,985
There'll be three things that we'll cover.

28
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:33,505
One unique challenges in financial
ai, which are regulatory compliance.

29
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:38,155
Model explainability data security and
the real time processing requirements

30
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:41,095
that distinguish finance from the
other machine learning domains.

31
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:45,435
Second, we'll talk about the production
gate machine learning operations

32
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:48,645
architecture, which includes the
technical components required for

33
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:53,325
scalable, reliable AI systems in banking,
in short and FinTech environments.

34
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,554
And then lastly, we talked through
some actionable strategies, which

35
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:59,135
are practical frameworks and
approaches for transitioning from

36
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,054
prototype to production Powerhouse.

37
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,494
What are the unique challenges
of AI in financial industries?

38
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,794
There are four different
pieces that we should, we cover

39
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,924
one regulatory compliance.

40
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:16,339
All models must satisfy the regulatory
requirements, primarily F-C-R-A-E,

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,694
C-O-A-G-D-P-R, and the basal standards
while providing full audit trails.

42
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:24,674
Then there's explain explainability
requirements where customers and

43
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:29,084
regulators are entitled to understand
the decision factors that go behind

44
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:33,494
the ML models, including like adverse
action notices, how this comes into play.

45
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:38,804
Then there's market volatility models,
experience rapid trans performance

46
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,694
degradation during economic shifts.

47
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:46,334
And lastly, there's adversarial threats
where fraud detection systems often

48
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,979
face sophisticated attackers actively
working to circumvent these detection.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,399
So how does financial ML ops
differ from the standard practices?

50
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,149
There's unique demands of the
financial service industry, which

51
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:02,899
requires specialized ML lops
capabilities that go far beyond

52
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,850
standard ML engineering practices.

53
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,559
The standard machine learning
operations includes a basic model

54
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:14,600
versioning, has simple AB testing,
has general purpose feature stores.

55
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,030
Has standard CI CD pipelines, and then
basic monitoring dashboards as well as

56
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,910
a general on purpose infrastructure.

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,750
We can be applicable across
different industries and places.

58
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,280
However, for financial ops, given
the challenges we've discussed

59
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,329
earlier, we need immutable audit
trails with regulatory metadata.

60
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,989
We need a champion challenger
with segment isolation.

61
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,400
We need time series optimized features,
stores with point in time correction.

62
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,584
We need compliance, integrated
deployment workflows.

63
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:51,364
We need segment level performance
monitoring with diff detection.

64
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,984
We need secure isolated infrastructure
with control access patterns.

65
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:59,964
As you can see, financial institutions
that attempt to implement AI with

66
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:04,135
it without sub specialized lops
infrastructure will face regulatory

67
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:08,420
challenges, model failures, and often
security vulnerable vulnerabilities

68
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,775
if they're using standard mops.

69
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:13,244
Let's then talk through what is
required for machine learning

70
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:16,245
operations architecture for the
financial services industry.

71
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:21,155
A robust financial MLS platform integrates
specialized components to address the

72
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:26,495
unique challenges of the industry while
enabling reliable, scalable AI operations.

73
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:31,855
Each component must be designed with
regulatory compliance, security,

74
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,215
and audibility as a foundation
requirement rather than afterthoughts.

75
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:36,675
What are the components?

76
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,825
A big chunk of that is
the data foundation.

77
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,975
You want your data to have three
different kind of qualities.

78
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:47,655
One, it should be a financial feature
stop where that, what that means

79
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,455
is a specialized four time data.

80
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:54,425
With point in time correctness, which
guarantees critical for accurate back

81
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,525
testing and regulatory compliance.

82
00:04:57,515 --> 00:05:02,165
It needs to support thousands of
variables per customer version, feature

83
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:06,065
definitions with lineage, and then
batch and online serving capabilities.

84
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,925
You also need to make sure that you
have a secure data access layer,

85
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:14,545
which means you have role-based
controls with fine brain permissions

86
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,135
and comprehensive audit logging.

87
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:19,185
This should follow the data
minimization principles.

88
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:23,295
It needs to make sure the personal
information is handed via a tokenization

89
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,665
so no one has access to PII information.

90
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,135
You need to have access.

91
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:29,985
You need to ensure there's
encryption addressed and in transit.

92
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,735
And then lastly, there's
a data quality framework.

93
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:36,785
You wanna make sure the data is
automatically validated with strict

94
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,635
schema enforcement and anomaly direction.

95
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:43,914
You need to have statistical profile
monitoring data, drift detection,

96
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,775
integrity constraints, validation.

97
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,544
The second component of the ML
lops is the model development.

98
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:55,215
For that, you need regulatory compliant
experimentation, tracking frameworks

99
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:59,025
that capture all model development
activities with required regulatory

100
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:04,634
metadata, fair lending analysis,
integration, disparate impact assessment

101
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,674
model cards with regulatory context.

102
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:11,084
So then as previously mentioned, you
need to make sure there's explainability

103
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:14,984
toolkit where you have a pre-approved
method for generating customer and

104
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:20,494
regulatory facing information, which
relates to adverse action code generation,

105
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:24,814
shap and Lyme integration, as well as
counterfactual explanation systems.

106
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:28,465
There are four stages now to
the deployment and operations.

107
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,294
One is the validation gateway.

108
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,240
You ensure this pre-deployment
verification, which ensures that

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,240
the model meets performance,
fairness, and compliance standards.

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,250
Then within that, you have to make sure
you have the champion challenge analysis,

111
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,280
stress testing across market scenarios,
sensitivity analysis on key segments.

112
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,729
The second is compliance integrated
CI c. You wanna make sure you have

113
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,929
the deployment pipelines, have the
required approvals, documentation,

114
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,059
and the various validation steps.

115
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,289
You wanna ensure there is immutable
audit, trail of deployments.

116
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,969
Role-based deployment controls,
automated regulatory documentation.

117
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,979
Thirdly, you wanna make sure there
segment of their monitoring so you

118
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,309
ensure at a segment level there's
performance tracking, especially

119
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,719
for critical customer segments.

120
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:20,904
They're alert with alerting for
regulatory constraint concerns.

121
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:25,584
Within that, you need to have
granular performance dashboards, drift

122
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:29,514
detection by segment, and then outlier
analysis for high value transactions.

123
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,934
Lastly is the automated retraining.

124
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:35,489
You wanna make sure you have a
scheduled or trigger based retraining

125
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,864
with validation guard rates, so
that when there's like a market

126
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:43,459
volatility of our scheduling, like a
COVID-19 scenario, you get a trigger.

127
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,579
You also wanna make sure there's
validation, gated promotions, and

128
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,939
then training data set versioning
so that after every figure, your

129
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,559
training data sets get updated.

130
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,779
As you can see each stage, you need
to enforce compliance requirements,

131
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,469
and this has to be done while
enabling operational efficiency.

132
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,939
Lastly, for the implementation
strategy, you wanna make sure you

133
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,669
have a phased approach against.

134
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:07,869
There are four phases.

135
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,789
The phase one is the foundation.

136
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,080
Where you build core infrastructure,
which is focused on data quality,

137
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,570
governance, and basic model tracking.

138
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,549
Within that, you wanna make sure you have
imple, you implement feature stored with

139
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:26,109
regulatory compliance built in, establish
experiment tracking with required

140
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:32,069
documentation, create secure development
environments with appropriate control in

141
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,720
phase two, which is a production pipeline.

142
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,604
You will develop automated
workflows for work model training,

143
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,044
validation, and deployment.

144
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:43,994
Within that, you will have to build a
compliance integrated CI ICD pipeline,

145
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:49,304
implement validation gateways with
regulatory checks, create model

146
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:53,165
registry with approved workflows, and
then coming to the third part, which

147
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,345
is operational excellence, where you
wanna make sure not only is your model

148
00:08:56,345 --> 00:09:00,125
compliant and ready to go, but it is
actually contributing to the firm.

149
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,474
You will establish comprehensive
monitoring and automated retraining,

150
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,854
deploy segment aware performance
monitoring, implement drift protection

151
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:13,385
and alerting, and then create automated
retraining pipelines of validation gates.

152
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:17,974
In the last is where you take a
model from not just being good,

153
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,535
but to being an industrial leader.

154
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:24,635
You focus on the advanced capabilities,
you add sophisticated features

155
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:25,985
for optimization and scaling.

156
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,915
Within that, you focus on the imp,
you will implement multi-arm banded

157
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:33,995
systems for model selection, deploy
shadow mode testing for new models,

158
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:38,675
and then create adaptive monitoring
thresholds by segment so that you can

159
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,195
constantly evolve and upgrade your model.

160
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:44,515
We've talked through some of this
previously, but I wanna highlight what

161
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:49,165
are the common pitfalls and how you can
avoid them as you enter the space of

162
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,505
ML ops for your financial institution.

163
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,405
Don't underestimate the
regulatory requirements.

164
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:59,585
Often the problem is that firms discover
compliance gaps late in the development,

165
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,595
which forces expensive rework.

166
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:06,215
The solution is to engage compliance teams
from day one and then build regulatory

167
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,495
requirements in technical specifications.

168
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:13,055
Secondly we've talked about this a
couple of times now, but there is a

169
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,785
concern about inadequate explainability.

170
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:19,475
The problem often arises when
the firms are unable to provide

171
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:22,955
required explanations for model
decisions in regulatory timeframes.

172
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:27,755
The solution, simple integrate
explainability methods during model

173
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,765
development and not as an afterthought.

174
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:33,575
So if you start thinking during
the model itself, how Q can explain

175
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,465
it up to regulators and customers.

176
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,185
Thirdly, which is the
insufficient segment.

177
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,330
Monitoring it basically means that if.

178
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,220
Your model's working well overall,
but you might be missing degradation

179
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,600
in critical customer segments.

180
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,760
Despite the overall good performance of
the model, the solution is to implement

181
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,840
granular monitoring across demographic,
behavioral, and product segments.

182
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,640
Lastly, it's the poor
handling of market volatility.

183
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,040
Sometimes models are made for steady
state markets, but off, but, and they

184
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,900
collapse during economic shifts like a
COVID-19 and lead to poor performances.

185
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,520
So the solution is to implement
stress testing across historical

186
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,839
scenarios and ensure that you have
responsive retraining triggers.

187
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:17,780
With that, let me.

188
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:22,224
Recall all the pieces that we've
talked about and summarize that into

189
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:26,664
the four major takeaways to build
production grade financial ML lops.

190
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:29,935
One, compliance is infrastructure.

191
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:34,614
Your compliance underpins everything, so
you wanna build regulatory requirements

192
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:38,064
directly into the ML lops components
rather than adding them later.

193
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:39,504
Second.

194
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,379
Segment level, everything.

195
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,920
While your model might look good overall,
you wanna make sure you're designing

196
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,300
all systems to operate at the segment
level for deployment, development, and

197
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,400
monitoring, and not as an afterthought.

198
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,060
Third, explainability by design.

199
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:57,209
You want to integrate explanation
systems from the beginning of the

200
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,290
development process so that when your
model is complete, you are able to

201
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,609
answer any questions related to that.

202
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,149
And then lastly, resilient architecture.

203
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,509
You wanna build systems that can
mean performance through market

204
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,129
volatility and data shifts.

205
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,299
These are the four underlying
pillars of how you would build

206
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,674
an ML model, ML lops model.

207
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,134
Anything else?

208
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,469
Thank you.
