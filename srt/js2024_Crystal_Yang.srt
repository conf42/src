1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,900
I'm Crystal Yang.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,140
I'm the CEO and founder at Automy.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,729
And today I want to take you guys
through how JavaScript can be a

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,040
powerful tool to solve social issues.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,749
So during this event, we've been
exploring a lot of the technical

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,439
capabilities of JavaScript.

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,040
But I think it's also crucial to
see how this language can impact one

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,349
of the most important areas today.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,319
Which is social impact.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,430
why am I talking about this?

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,310
there are tons of social issues that
could be addressed with JavaScript.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,899
The challenge is actually making an impact
when you only have a technical background.

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,989
So today, I want to explore how we can
build ventures that integrate not only a

15
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:46,129
technical background, but also business
principles to create tangible social good.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,989
So first, why technology?

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,480
in my opinion, technology is a
great tool for social impact.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,159
specifically, I believe
it's for these four reasons.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,210
So first, technology is super scalable.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,880
you can build technology,
software that can reach a really

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,180
large audience very fast without
any limitations of, geography.

22
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,745
that other impact methods have.

23
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:13,075
Also, technology is really accessible.

24
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:17,525
So especially JavaScript, it's
very versatile, very web based.

25
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,905
So it makes it easier to build products
that are accessible to anyone pretty

26
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:26,425
much with an internet connection, which
can really help in reaching unserved and

27
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:27,955
different communities around the world.

28
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,075
Also, JavaScript is really efficient.

29
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:36,325
it can help automate processes, do real
time data, and, allow us just to optimize

30
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:39,165
resources and improve outcomes for users.

31
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:42,015
And then lastly, innovation, obviously.

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,565
Technovation is the hub, in
my opinion, for innovation.

33
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:49,345
It's like a breeding ground for
experimentation, and it allows

34
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,915
us to rethink solutions to
long standing social problems.

35
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:59,125
So we have a technical, advantage,
but how do you take a technical

36
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:03,495
idea and transform it into something
that actually has social impact?

37
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:09,714
So to do this, I recommend learning
from our business friends and looking at

38
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:12,035
how they take their products to market.

39
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:16,755
So building a successful product is
definitely more than just coding.

40
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,885
It's a lot about understanding
market needs and delivering something

41
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,944
that people actually find valuable.

42
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,535
So I'll share my own experience
with Automy to highlight this.

43
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:31,335
my startup, Automy, is actually Started
as a small JavaScript project actually,

44
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:35,875
and now it's transformed into one of the
largest educational game platforms for

45
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,605
blind and visually impaired students.

46
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:42,644
And today we've impacted over 1000
blind students and partnered with seven

47
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,465
schools for the blind around the world.

48
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:50,475
So some advice I've had from building
Automy, I think first is to develop

49
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:55,825
a MVP or as the business people
say, it's a minimum viable product.

50
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:58,044
So this is a common term in business land.

51
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:02,645
And what it means is that you shouldn't
build for perfection in the start.

52
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:08,435
for example, in my case, my first Automy
MVP was pretty crappy, to be honest.

53
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,845
It was definitely far from ideal.

54
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,454
It was pretty much just a program
that regurgitated basic math

55
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:18,635
problems, and it used text to speech
and automatic speech recognition.

56
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:23,275
But, I didn't try to make
that product the best I could.

57
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:27,565
Instead, I took this early version
to teachers that worked with

58
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,335
blind students, And from them,
I was able to gather feedback.

59
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:34,645
And the insights that they
gave me were really invaluable.

60
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:38,735
And they allowed me to pivot and create
products that actually met their needs.

61
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:43,645
So they were able to give me feedback
on educational tools and what I should

62
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:47,445
do to increase the educational value
of the product, as well as what I could

63
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,305
do to make the product more accessible.

64
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,270
So this helps me build a more usable
and, needed product, which in turn

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,669
made it easier to get users and
create actual impact in the future.

66
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,695
So what can you do to
build impactful products?

67
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:08,035
So first, from that story,
you should build a MVP.

68
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:12,025
So your MVP should just include
the essential features that

69
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,965
you need to address the core
problem that you're solving.

70
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:20,075
After you have an MVP, you should
go out and test and gather feedback.

71
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,105
So don't go wait for perfection.

72
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:26,195
You should launch your MVP to a small
audience and gather their thoughts.

73
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:30,844
This is because many business startup
founders, especially put in a lot of

74
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:35,075
effort a lot of work to making one
product and then they realize that users

75
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:38,514
customers don't actually need this, right?

76
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:42,965
So people waste a lot of time and
resources into building features that

77
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:45,495
people don't actually need or even want.

78
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:45,525
Yeah.

79
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,990
to do this, you build your MVP, and you
have to iterate through this process.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,149
So you build a product, you get
feedback, and then you implement

81
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,119
those features, and then you go back
and iterate over and over until you

82
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,870
are ready with the final product.

83
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,470
This is a great advantage of computer
science and JavaScript, actually,

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,510
since it's super, super easy to make
changes compared to other mediums.

85
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,875
So for example, if you're like building
hardware, this would be terrible

86
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:17,465
because you would have to build a new
prototype and then ship it out and all

87
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,225
this stuff that you would need to do.

88
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,695
When in computer science, for
example, when I was building Automy,

89
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,454
a teacher would just tell me like,
Hey, it would be great if you could

90
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:28,784
make Automy compatible with screen
readers or with keyboard interaction.

91
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:32,955
And in at most a week, I would be
able to implement their suggestions.

92
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:33,329
yeah.

93
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,729
There's definitely a great side to
computer science and that helps a lot

94
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,709
with this idea of product and iteration.

95
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:46,329
So next, I would love to give some
information on how to build a team.

96
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,069
So building a team is really important
because if you want to scale your

97
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,779
startup or your technology, it requires
more people to do outreach, to do

98
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,419
promotion, to help you build your
platform, all this sort of stuff.

99
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:02,599
So currently, Autumny's team
is actually made up of over 30

100
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,649
volunteers, which is super exciting.

101
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,039
And they're all dedicated
to the same cause.

102
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,449
And building this team,
was pretty hard for me.

103
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,419
I didn't have any startup experience in
the past, but it was really interesting

104
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,379
and people asked me a lot how I do it.

105
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:21,379
So for me, I did it through, two ways.

106
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,559
So first I identified my audience.

107
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:31,644
So I knew who I would need to help
me build my product So I knew I

108
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:35,544
needed developers designers and
outreach people and social media

109
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:41,414
teams and other people so I only
looked for this group of Team members.

110
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:45,454
So a lot of people just Take on all
sorts of volunteers just willing to

111
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:50,809
do anything Like i've seen like an hr
manager at a 10 person like volunteer

112
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,449
venture, but, yeah, definitely
identify what you need so you don't

113
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,999
waste any time into recruiting people.

114
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,089
And then the second thing is how
do I actually recruit people?

115
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:04,849
So the best thing about having a
nonprofit is that there are volunteers

116
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,289
out there willing to do work.

117
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:10,629
So on Google's development course,
they actually have a thing where

118
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,799
they recommend people who are just
starting to learn about technology.

119
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:21,219
To websites such as volunteer match
and idealify that allow volunteers who

120
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,699
are just learning how to code or have
a little bit of experience but want to

121
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,809
find more experience in the real world.

122
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:33,009
they show opportunities of nonprofits
that are working to improve their website

123
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,009
or just looking for help in general.

124
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,289
So in my case, I was able to use this
platform, to find a lot of developers

125
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:43,919
and to find a lot of designers who
were then able to help my cause.

126
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,689
So definitely having a 5013C
helps a lot, especially in the non

127
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,239
profit world where you can recruit
volunteers who align with your values.

128
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:57,069
So those are my two biggest pieces
of advice on building a team.

129
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,149
But at the end of the day, you
need people to actually have

130
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,459
your product to make an impact.

131
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,219
So here's what worked for us in
getting connections with users.

132
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:09,529
So first.

133
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,044
Obviously, you have to
know who you're targeting.

134
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,934
So know who will benefit from your
project and know how to access them.

135
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,444
So for us, it was blind students and
their teachers and to access them.

136
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:24,204
We contacted schools for the blind
and developed with our users.

137
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,049
And they were able to, actually
find value in our games.

138
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,249
Again, the second point,
aligns with the MVP idea.

139
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,119
You should be building for users,
not based off of your assumptions.

140
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,619
So you should always build
with your customers in mind.

141
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,649
In my case, I integrated teachers
within the development of Automy,

142
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,939
and it became much easier to attract
users because we were solving real

143
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:51,629
problems, not just hypothetical ones.

144
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,989
And a lot of times people can use
different, promotion tactics, social

145
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:01,119
media, community events, word of mouth,
whatever you've identified your audiences,

146
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,059
figure out how best to reach them.

147
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:08,129
So next I want to talk
about why JavaScript.

148
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:12,794
JavaScript is the ideal
tool for social impact.

149
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,424
First of all, it's a website.

150
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:16,814
There's tons of accessibility
with the website.

151
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,904
It's used all across the internet.

152
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,804
As long as you have internet, as
long as you can access websites,

153
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,154
you can use a JavaScript project.

154
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:28,434
So this definitely breaks down barriers
to access and allows for people all

155
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,634
around the world with connection
to internet to use your products.

156
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:34,754
Next JavaScript is super interactive.

157
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,469
It's very user friendly and it
can be customized for people with

158
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,689
all sorts of different abilities.

159
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:45,259
And lastly, JavaScript is
able to be integrated with all

160
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,779
sorts of other technologies.

161
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,419
So currently, for example, if you want
natural language processing in your,

162
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:56,229
in your code, you can integrate, chat
GPT API into your JavaScript programs.

163
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,179
if you want to integrate hardware,
you could easily code some sort

164
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,399
of hardware compatibility that
can interact with the JavaScript

165
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:07,039
backend and overall JavaScript just.

166
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,209
makes it easy to combine
different languages and tools

167
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,379
with back end systems of websites.

168
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,579
this would allow developers to just
create innovative social solutions

169
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,879
tailored towards social impact.

170
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,699
to wrap up, JavaScript is more
than just a technical skill.

171
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,309
It's definitely a great tool
to bridge the digital world and

172
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,059
real world social challenges.

173
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,804
And, by building scalable, and
accessible and innovative solutions.

174
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,414
Combining your tech projects with
business principles can create

175
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:44,894
products to have true social impact.

176
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:49,574
So I hope you're inspired to keep
using JavaScript in ways that

177
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:53,684
are not only solving technical
problems, but also contributing

178
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,464
to meaningful change in the world.

179
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:56,094
Thank you.
