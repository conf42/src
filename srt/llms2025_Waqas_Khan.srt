1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,160
my name is Hamad VAAs.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,520
I am a lead technical
product manager at Quali.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,680
Qua is basically a game
development and publishing company.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:18,190
we work both in mobile console, PC and all
the other platforms including Nintendo,

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,300
and, any other platforms that support
games, whether it's web games, as well.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,770
I have, almost more than seven years of
experience now in product management.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,810
I am a software engineer basically, and,
I have devoted my entire professional

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,340
experience to product management.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,830
and, this topic, leveraging LLM, For
your data-driven product management

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,650
is something that I am, myself
learning and trying to implement

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,720
that in my own company, and I'm
seeing, terrific results already.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,790
So I'm very excited for this session.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,300
so let's quickly jump
onto the session itself.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,240
So I'm gonna move to the session.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,850
so the topic itself, leveraging
LLMs for data-driven.

17
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,485
Decision making, in product management.

18
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:03,745
this is something that, as I said,
I'm learning myself, but I've

19
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:08,015
seen, some amazing results to,
use a large language models and

20
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,585
to understand how natural it is.

21
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,895
It's something that even
I was surprised as well.

22
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:14,455
So let's go through.

23
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:19,955
So let's start with what is, large
language models, as a brief, and

24
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,675
the most simplest definition is
that LLMs are advanced AI models,

25
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:28,065
that are trained on diverse data
sets to understand and generate the

26
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:30,495
next sequence of humanlike text.

27
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:35,895
So for example, if I'm saying, if my
answer to how are you is I am fine.

28
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:40,215
So the model would understand that
a normal human talks like that and

29
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,265
then they would try to, imitate.

30
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,490
and try to generate text
as humanly as possible.

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,720
That's the most simplest of
definitions of LLMs, however.

32
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:56,625
It has so many vast usages, and you
can now see, like chat, GPT, deep seek,

33
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:02,825
Claude, all these, ai tools and AI search
engines are now trying to imitate how

34
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:05,355
a normal human would respond to a text.

35
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:10,215
So it doesn't sound like a machine
originated text, and that's how.

36
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:14,575
LLM used the powerful, natural
language processing to make

37
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,265
sure that it's very human.

38
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:22,835
you can use that in your AI agents, you
can use that in your normal, conversations

39
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:27,495
as your first point of conversations,
as well as your entire, your entire

40
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:32,595
customer management can just be used, can
just be managed using the powerful LLMs.

41
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:37,615
That's the brief definition of it, but we
will, we'll dive deep into that later on.

42
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:43,125
Now, the other part of this, session is
data-driven decision making right now.

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,739
Product management is taking a huge turn
towards using large sets of data, plotted

44
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,529
in very user-friendly graphs, and funnels.

45
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:57,559
this is very crucial when you are
planning your roadmap, when you're making

46
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:01,399
sure that your product has the feature
that the people will actually use.

47
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,099
So it's very critical.

48
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:08,914
That not just, in the roadmap, you
use this data driven decision making,

49
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:13,174
but once you have deployed this
feature, you make sure that your

50
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:17,434
customer touchpoints are properly
implemented and that you make sure

51
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,294
that once you have deployed a feature.

52
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,599
You know that what KPIs I'm going for.

53
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,809
Those might be retention,
those might be conversion rate,

54
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,009
those might be engagement rate.

55
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,959
Whatever your KPI is, someone has
revenue, number of orders, number of

56
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,369
clicks, number of conversions, whatever
you're going for, you have to make sure

57
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:39,549
those touch points are the ones that is.

58
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,169
making an impact in your decision making.

59
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,479
That is your data-driven decision making.

60
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,539
This approach heavily relies on metrics.

61
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:52,129
Now, imagine data-driven decision
making combined together with LLMs,

62
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:57,619
LLM, bringing huge sets of data that
basically define that how a human

63
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,719
would emulate your features before
even you deploy that in the market.

64
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,639
That's how powerful this can be.

65
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,480
So that's the.

66
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:11,474
The use and the importance of data-driven
decision making in these times, basically.

67
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,544
So now.

68
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:17,909
When you have understood LMS and
you have understood the need for

69
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,409
decision making, with proper data,
let's combine together and understand

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,919
how LMS can enhance your product
management and your decision making.

71
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,190
The first thing and the very,
very important is market

72
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,570
research and trend analysis.

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,560
Now, when I'm doing it alone
with just my own research, I can

74
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,510
probably find 50 competitors, right?

75
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,480
Or even a hundred competitors
if I have enough time, but.

76
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,490
LMS can now scan large data sources
because it is, it has a vast data sources.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,600
it can help you using your competitor
updates, sorry, updates, industry reports.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,090
Your news, identify key trends.

79
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,030
you might even get real time insights.

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
So for example, if I am.

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,300
If I'm building an e-commerce website,
for example, with, a specific niche of

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,220
products, LLM would tell me that what is
the segment of users you should target?

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,570
How they would behave in the market
with this spec specific audience that

84
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,980
you're going for, and whether you have
to make early decisions before going

85
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,570
into the market and understanding.

86
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,330
The next is customer feedback analysis.

87
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,540
So once your market is done,
market research is done, then you

88
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,570
have to understand how you are
collecting your customer feedback.

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,790
Now LLMs can again give you, some proper
categorization, whether it's sentiment

90
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,420
analysis, whether it's, highlighting
your recurring issues with the customer.

91
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,570
for example, you have 10 million users and
your LLM can eventually tell you that what

92
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,280
is the issue that is constantly occurring
for a specific audience, and then you

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,180
can actually make decisions without
scanning all those customer feedbacks.

94
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:54,295
Your feature prioritization.

95
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,310
This is very crucial as a product
manager and I hope the product

96
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,870
managers would agree with me that when
you are prioritizing features, you

97
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,670
have so many different influences.

98
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,750
Your CEOs, your COOs, your lead
product, your business analysts, they

99
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,725
all will try to influence features.

100
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,455
As they want.

101
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:18,615
But when it comes to decision driven,
data-driven decision making and LLMs,

102
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,945
you actually have the data in front
of you where you can prioritize.

103
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:27,645
You can actually emulate how your features
were due using the LLM dataset, and

104
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:31,185
then you can eventually give them the
data even before going into the market.

105
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:35,025
It can give you historical
feature management, like how

106
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,345
historically this feature.

107
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,615
This kind of feature has
behaved in the market.

108
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,085
and also what's the customer demand?

109
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:46,375
LMS can even predict the potential
impact of new features on your product

110
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,755
before you release the product.

111
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:52,914
And you can actually show your C-E-O-C-O
CFOs that this is how the data.

112
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:58,564
is talking, so you wanna listen or
not AB testing, again, no product

113
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:02,224
manager can survive in this industry
without properly ab testing.

114
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:05,465
The, your features before you,
like when you launch them.

115
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:09,424
LMS can actually automate the
interpretation of test results,

116
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,664
identifying which variations
perform best and viable.

117
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:18,004
Not just the, with the current data, but
actually the historical, the predictive

118
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,164
data and the current data that you have.

119
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:24,155
So if I'm a product manager, I only
make decision with the current data,

120
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:28,744
but LLN can give me predictive analysis,
historical analysis, and current analysis.

121
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:33,415
Automating the reporting part, again,
is very crucial that LMS can generate

122
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:37,735
ex executive summaries, dashboards, key
takeaways is pretty self-explanatory.

123
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:42,055
Speaker notes, again, by leveraging lms,
product managers can actually automate

124
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:47,455
market research, analyze customer
feedback at scale, and generate meaningful

125
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,285
insights with minimal manual effort.

126
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:53,115
that's very crucial that you're
actually talking at scale with LMS

127
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,735
and not just your current data set.

128
00:07:55,725 --> 00:08:00,135
Moving along, what kind of tools
or technologies LMS are being

129
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:01,695
used currently in the market?

130
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,925
First thing is you have OpenAI
your chat GPTs, your, all the

131
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:09,325
buzz in the market with the chat
g bt that they all are using, for,

132
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:10,885
they're used for text generations.

133
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,909
They're used for summarizations, LLMs.

134
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,364
This literally are the data sets that
actually give you the human output.

135
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:18,954
You have your Google Bird.

136
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:22,954
again, optimized for natural
living, lang natural language

137
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:25,115
understanding using the LLMs.

138
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:29,305
you can use Claude Ro, you can use,
again, hugging face transformers.

139
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:33,725
that's basically up to you what kind of
combination of tools you're going for.

140
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:37,195
You can even go for your
custom LLM integration that's.

141
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:41,565
That's a bit, resource heavy, but
if you want to make your own use

142
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,775
case, you can actually use open
source APIs and then you can make

143
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,325
it in and in the way that you want.

144
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:52,505
I would suggest to start very simple
to use like, let's try chat GPT.

145
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,815
Try and understand how
the data set's working.

146
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,655
Just make sure that your features
are prioritized properly with chat

147
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,155
g bt, for example, or Google Bird.

148
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:01,745
And then slowly and gradually.

149
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,280
Start about, a humiliating your
ab test, your insights, trends,

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,930
your predictive analysis.

151
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,550
Just make sure to start small, but make
sure that you are using historical and

152
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,470
predictive data for your future planning.

153
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,550
What challenges and considerations you
need to make whilst you are, transforming

154
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,230
to normal product management, to data
driven LRM based product management.

155
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,970
the quality, the data
quality, and the bias.

156
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,380
One thing that I always say is
you cannot a hundred percent

157
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,270
rely on large set of data.

158
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,460
You have to make sure that.

159
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:38,295
the quality of the data and the
source of the data is validated.

160
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:42,075
If it's not validated, you are
basically planning to fail.

161
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,725
Just make sure that the sources of
your data is properly validated.

162
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:50,235
You know that the, where the data
is coming from, and once your

163
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:54,225
entire segmentation of data is
ready, only then you make decisions.

164
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:59,385
Otherwise, you will go towards very biased
features, biased results, and inaccurate

165
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,505
predictions, which is something that.

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,450
The, some product managers
like are actually making this

167
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,070
mistake in the market right now.

168
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,750
Interpretability is very crucial
that you have to understand the data.

169
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,240
If you cannot understand the data,
make sure that you have a data

170
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,360
engineer, you have a data scientist,
you have a, an analyst who can

171
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,170
tell you, what this data means.

172
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,010
So just make sure that you understand
the data, scalability, and cost.

173
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,815
As everyone knows, it's not cheap
to, to, to use these models.

174
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,855
Just make sure that you start small.

175
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,795
You have to make sure that it
is actually useful for you.

176
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:35,765
Don't just jump into the bandwagon.

177
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,495
Make sure that this is
actually useful for you.

178
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,845
If it's not, if you have the data
and you only need to use the current

179
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:47,670
data and real data, you don't need
to, go towards this direction.

180
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,925
Ethical and privacy concerns.

181
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:54,405
Some data sets are not properly, sourced.

182
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:58,895
just make sure if your organization is
going towards this route, your legal,

183
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,575
actually check the data sources as well.

184
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,065
some best practices.

185
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:02,545
Again, this is.

186
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,785
Purely subjective, purely
coming from my side.

187
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,105
It might be different for you.

188
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,485
It might be different for anyone else.

189
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:12,935
some guidelines for, from my side,
for success in this, in this domain

190
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,855
is clearly define the problem.

191
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,535
Just don't give the problem.

192
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,965
Like customers are not logging in.

193
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:19,925
That's not a problem.

194
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,370
That is an outcome That is.

195
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,020
An outcome of a problem, make sure
your problem is very well defined.

196
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,150
Only then start talking ai.

197
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,410
AI is not step one.

198
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
It's not step two.

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
It's not step three.

200
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,890
It's probably step five.

201
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,300
Step six, make sure all your steps
before AI are properly sorted.

202
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,750
Use high quality, unbiased
data for model training.

203
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,095
Make sure that your data is
properly vetted, properly validated.

204
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,480
Treat AI as an assistant,
not a replacement.

205
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,510
that's something that I
can just make a headline.

206
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,120
AI is not here to replace anyone.

207
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,360
People who use AI will replace
the people who don't use ai, but

208
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,680
AI will not replace anything.

209
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,450
Make sure that AI is your assistant.

210
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,040
It's not making decisions for you.

211
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:08,175
Continuously test, monitor and
refine models to improve accuracy.

212
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,795
Again, let's face self-explanatory.

213
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:15,465
Communicate AI insights transparently to
stakeholders, but make sure your analyst

214
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,325
actually agrees with the data as well.

215
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,855
Sometimes when you're talking
with large data sets, some of

216
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,265
the data will not make sense.

217
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:27,305
So your analyst might cut down garbage
data and give you a proper graph, and then

218
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:29,855
transparently show it to stakeholders.

219
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,545
What future I see of AI
in product management.

220
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,715
I think it's quite clear.

221
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:37,865
Your bis, your proper business
inside should properly be using ai.

222
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,415
It's very crucial that you
have predictive models.

223
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:44,165
You have current and anana model
and you have historical models.

224
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,405
They all should work seamlessly
merging with business intelligence

225
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,795
systems, real time AI, decision making.

226
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:56,665
That is something that is still quite far
away, but I have seen intelligent CEOs

227
00:12:57,205 --> 00:13:02,355
referred to as I CEOs who are actually
CEOs, but an AI and who are making

228
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:07,035
business decisions or actually just
suggest suggesting business decisions.

229
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,205
So it can be happening in real
time, but still a bit far away.

230
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:11,685
But I think.

231
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,990
AI should still be vetted, should still
be properly managed, but there will

232
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,710
be a point where AI will constantly
be making decisions without actually

233
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,850
involving anyone else, but that's
still quite far away right now.

234
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,300
As I said, AI cannot replace
anyone at this point.

235
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,100
Improved explainability, AI models
will become more transparent

236
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,420
in how they generate insights.

237
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:36,665
Fully AI driven product management, still
quite far away, but that is the future.

238
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:40,965
it might not be, an automated
solution, but product management,

239
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,465
product development, product
management is different.

240
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,345
Product development is different,
but product development will heavily

241
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:49,165
be influenced with AI code sourcing.

242
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:54,385
So AI might be writing code for basic
models, but still you need software

243
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:58,045
engineers to properly validate that code
and actually improve that code as well.

244
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:01,585
So that is everything from my side.

245
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,145
As I said, this topic is still
something that I'm learning as

246
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,535
well, but it's a need of the time.

247
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,835
You have to make sure that your, your
product management is properly, improving

248
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,785
with these emerging technologies.

249
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,765
You like lms.

250
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:19,455
and make sure to be, on track
for yourself to be improved.

251
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:24,405
And, for improving not just yourself,
but your product, your company, and make

252
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:29,415
sure that your customers are getting
the best out of your product using the

253
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,105
LLMs and using all the technologies
that the current industry has to offer.

254
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:34,545
Thank you so much.

255
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:40,435
I'm very thankful to, the Con 42
conference, for inviting me to speak and,

256
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:44,795
please feel free to connect with me on
LinkedIn and, I'll make sure to respond

257
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,475
anything that you guys have to ask.

258
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,225
Thank you so much.

259
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,665
Have a wonderful day.
