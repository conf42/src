00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,340
I'm Abhishek Vajpayee, and I'm
thrilled to discuss how AI driven

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,329
IoT is transforming healthcare.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,110
Together with Ratesh Mohan, we
explored how these innovations improve

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,679
accessibility, personalization, and
data integrity in the healthcare space.

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,519
Today, we'll walk you through the
evolution of chatbot architectures,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,979
the role of scalable infrastructure,
real world use cases, and future

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,490
impacts of these technologies.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,619
Now I will hand over to
Ratesh to get started.

10
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:31,904
Thanks, Abhishek.

11
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:35,805
Just to get started, let's first
get a general understanding

12
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:36,934
of how chatbots work.

13
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:41,845
Traditional chatbots can be built on
static architectures with predefined

14
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:45,945
responses or the more modern ones
using generative AI and other

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,265
machine learning driven methods.

16
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,985
The aim here is to take input
from a user and provide an output.

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:57,435
These inputs can be text, voice, image,
or user actions such as click of a

18
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:01,435
button sent through some kind of user
interface or any versions of those.

19
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:05,435
This input passes through a
processing module that can be as

20
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:07,005
simple as a rule based engine.

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,110
Or could be a complex module
using all sorts of machine

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,460
learning driven submodules to
produce and process those outputs.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,330
Backend services have connected to other
peripherals such as knowledge bases,

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,800
integrations to other machine learning
services, and other such modules that can

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,340
then process these intermediate inputs and
get the final output ready to be served.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,530
In contrast, IoT based chatbots
integrate real time data from devices.

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,945
IoT allowing adaptive and
context aware responses.

28
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:45,415
They connect directly with IoT sensors
to offer precise, actionable insight.

29
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:49,994
So just like the text or image or
other signals in the traditional

30
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:56,080
chatbots, IoT devices has an input
layer that can get signals from sensors,

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,590
smart devices, and IoT gateways.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,499
This data then is connected to a
cloud and can be readily available

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,130
to be processed by the next stage.

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,940
This next stage could be an NLP engine, a
voice engine, or a full dialogue manager.

35
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:16,225
So this should give you an
idea about how IoT chatbots are

36
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:20,415
different but still follow a similar
architecture as traditional chatbots.

37
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:25,954
This shift has redefined patient
care, enabling 24 7 assistance

38
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,795
and timely intervention.

39
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:32,394
One of the biggest advantages
is in the accessibility benefits

40
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,145
that IoT chatbots provide.

41
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:39,255
IoT based systems are available around
the clock, breaking barriers like office

42
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,965
hours and geographical constraints.

43
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:46,165
For elderly or disabled patients,
voice enabled IoT devices provide

44
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,055
effortless access to health care.

45
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:52,675
For example, a voice assistant
can remind a patient to take their

46
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,695
medication or guide them through
managing a chronic condition.

47
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,480
This empowers patients to take charge
of their health, fostering independence

48
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,250
and trust in healthcare systems.

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,540
This entire process can be easily
automated to detect events and

50
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,269
deliver the appropriate care.

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,880
Add to this a flavor of personalization
and you get a system that is

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,850
calibrated to a patient's profile.

53
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,350
AI systems use recommendation
algorithms such as collaborative

54
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,590
filtering and content filtering
to deliver tailored suggestions.

55
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,060
For instance, wearable devices can
analyze your activity levels and

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,070
recommend adjustment to your exercise
routine, diet, or medication.

57
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,730
Let's look at some of these
personalization methods.

58
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,249
Recommendation algorithms often fall into
these categories as listed on the screen.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,989
The collaborative filtering ones,
which learns from a user's behavior.

60
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,920
The content based filtering
ones, which tailors suggestions

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,020
based on the item attributes.

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,250
Or you can have hybrid models, which
are combining both for richer insights.

63
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,600
These are also called ensemble methods.

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,330
For instance, a wearable device tracking
your sleep patterns could recommend

65
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,140
lifestyle adjustments or signal a
physician if irregularities are detected.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,329
This real time personalization
ensures care evolves

67
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,719
alongside the patient's needs.

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,760
I will now hand it over to
Abhishek to talk about how Scalable

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,920
Recommendation Systems appear.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,200
Thank you, Ratesh.

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,920
Personalization at scale
introduces challenges.

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,240
As user bases grow, systems must
maintain low latency responses

73
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:26,760
and handle vast datasets.

74
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,810
This is where Scalable
Recommendation Systems shine.

75
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:34,360
For example, Netflix processes
billions of recommendations daily.

76
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,500
Similar frameworks can be applied in
healthcare to analyze patient data,

77
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,390
delivering timely interventions.

78
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,480
even with increasing demands.

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,360
Scalability is critical
for AI and IoT systems.

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,710
Scalable infrastructure allows system to
handle increased data and user demands

81
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,450
without compromising performance.

82
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:57,019
This is achieved through use of
cloud platforms like AWS and Google

83
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,890
Cloud for flexible resources.

84
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,744
Real time Apache Kafka and distributed
computing tools like Apache.

85
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,155
part for processing massive
data sets efficiently.

86
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:14,305
These components ensure healthcare systems
can scale seamlessly as demands grow.

87
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:19,795
Now we can talk about some best practices
for building scalable infrastructures.

88
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:24,355
To build scalable AI ML
infrastructures, organizations

89
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:26,614
must follow these best practices.

90
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:31,095
Use data lakes to store both
structured and unstructured data.

91
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:36,515
Leverage hyper parameter optimization
to fine tune models for better accuracy.

92
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:42,225
Automate deployment with CI CD pipelines
for quicker iterations and robust systems.

93
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:47,325
This ensures systems remain reliable,
efficient, and future ready.

94
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:52,605
AI ML infrastructure doesn't just improve
technology, it also empowers teams.

95
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:57,405
Pre built scalable infrastructures
accelerate time to value for clients.

96
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,254
Cloud native tools enable
seamless collaboration between

97
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,435
teams working on data analytics.

98
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:07,085
As the client needs grow,
scalable systems adapt without

99
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:09,165
requiring complete overhauls.

100
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:12,125
Now let's look at real world examples.

101
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:17,004
During the pandemic, AI driven
chatbots managed millions of

102
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:21,625
COVID 19 related queries, reducing
strain on healthcare systems.

103
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:26,385
IoT based glucose monitors now send real
time alerts to doctors and patients,

104
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,775
preventing diabetic emergencies.

105
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:34,055
These examples demonstrate how IoT and
AI enhance healthcare outcomes while

106
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,395
improving operational efficiency.

107
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,505
Now, I'll hand it over to Ratesh
to talk about some key takeaways.

108
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,185
Thank you, Abhishek.

109
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:47,964
To summarize, we can say that
scalable infrastructure is essential

110
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:53,095
for handling growing demands as
The best practices like distributed

111
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:57,285
data storage and automated training
pipelines ensure system reliability

112
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:58,915
and make your system future proof.

113
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:03,525
AI and ML infrastructure empowers
healthcare, just as it is providing

114
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:06,225
to other domains of e commerce.

115
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,205
And these providers help the
patients, driving them with

116
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,865
better engagement and outcomes.

117
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,675
As a conclusion, we can, we'll say
AI driven IoT is revolutionizing

118
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:20,005
healthcare by making it more
accessible, personalized, and efficient.
