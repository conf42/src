00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,740
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Let's deep dive and explore how social
determinants of health commonly known

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,930
as SDOH are significantly impacting
healthcare outcomes of member

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,760
populations, particularly in rural
healthcare settings where integration

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,615
into clinical workflows, presence,
unique challenges currently in us.

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:27,615
10.2% of households are facing
food insecurity and nearly

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:33,915
580,000 member population is
experiencing housing instability.

8
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:39,404
Addressing these SDUH factors through
structured healthcare interventions

9
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:40,960
is crucial for health equity.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,290
This presentation offers evidence-based
strategies for screening, operational

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,460
integration, and community
collaboration to effectively incorporate

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,530
SDOH into healthcare systems.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,720
Let's explore how standard tools
and advanced analytics can transform

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,490
care delivery leading to measurable
improvements in patient outcomes

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,200
and organizational efficiency.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,540
Let's look into what healthcare and SDOH.

17
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:14,035
Factors are the important SDOH
determinants of health are

18
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:19,135
housing, food, security, safety,
transportation, and utilities.

19
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,745
Let's deep dive housing.

20
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:27,535
Housing stability, or the lack of
stability, quality, and affordability

21
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:32,785
of the members for related to housing
directly impacts health outcomes.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,530
Where unstable housing is linked to
increased emergency department visits

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,950
and delayed care food security.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,350
Access to nutritious food affects
chronic disease management with food

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,480
insecurity is, which is prevalent
in 10.2% of US households today.

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,870
Safety, interpersonal safety concerns
can prevent proper healthcare

27
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,910
engagement and significant impact.

28
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,360
Physical significantly impact
physical and mental health.

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Transportation.

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,930
The lack of real reliable
transportation is disabling access

31
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,390
to healthcare services where 3.6
million Americans today are missing

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,579
medical appointments due to lack of
transportation and having those barriers.

33
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,490
Utilities, any access to
electricity, water communication

34
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,070
services directly affect medication
storage, telehealth participation,

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,260
and overall health management.

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,869
There are evidence-based
impacts of SDOH integration.

37
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:43,559
We, it has been seen that once SDOH
has been integrated into the clinical

38
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,510
workflows and healthcare framework.

39
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:52,515
Almost 86% of gain has been
achieved in completion of member

40
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:57,975
screenings, where initially there
were, the outreach was decreased.

41
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:02,444
But once the integration of SDH
has been successfully completed,

42
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:09,134
the rate of screening for all these
members have been achieved up to 86%.

43
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:16,594
It has been proven that the number
of percentages of emergency visits

44
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:22,234
by the patients in these rural
settings have decreased by 28%.

45
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:25,869
Once the SDOH intervention
has been implemented.

46
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:30,419
Let's look into how these screening
F framework and how we can

47
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,279
standardize this screening framework.

48
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,839
There are several steps to it.

49
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,119
Effective ING implementation
requires careful consideration of

50
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:42,349
patient population characteristics,
clinical workflow integration

51
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,939
points and staff capacity.

52
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,789
Organizations have to monitor
screening completion rates and positive

53
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:53,809
screening follow UPS metrics to
continuously refine their approach.

54
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,424
There are a couple of ways to do it.

55
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,299
One implementing Core Five screening
tool, which is nothing but adopting

56
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,619
standardized questionnaire, addressing
food insecurity, housing instability,

57
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,599
transportation barriers, utility needs,
and interpersonal safety concerns.

58
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,849
Next comes determining how, and
when the screening has to occur.

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,769
That is determining the frequency,
establishing protocols for initial

60
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,789
screening and periodic assessment
based on risk stratification

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,409
with high risk patients.

62
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,330
Screened quarterly is important.

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,760
Next is how do we integrate this
into the clinical workflows?

64
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,680
Embedding screening within EHR
systems at key clinical touch

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,360
points, including annual wellness
visits, transition of care, and

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,150
chronic disease follow-ups is vital.

67
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,300
The last step comes into training
the clinical staff, providing

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,250
comprehensive training on screening,
administration, response interpretation,

69
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,930
and appropriate intervention.

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:04,700
Pathways are needed to identify who is
and how much staff training is required.

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,400
Organizations that have implemented
this re, this Restructured Care team

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,609
model report significant improvements
in patient engagement, where previously

73
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,859
it was difficult to reach populations.

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,949
Currently with this implementation,
they have shown about 75% participation

75
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,719
in recommended interventions.

76
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,150
This integrated approach ensures
that the clinical and social care

77
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,549
coordination is at the maximum.

78
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,409
Let's look into, let's compare
the traditional clinical team

79
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,599
and the enhanced team structure.

80
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:44,849
The traditional clinical team
consisted of finish physicians.

81
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,320
Nurses, medical assistants, and
all of their focus was on medical

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,530
diagnosis and treatment, where
limited capacity was focusing on

83
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,810
social, addressing social needs.

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,990
Whereas the enhanced team structure is
an integration of social workers and

85
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,660
community health workers who specialize
in SDOH assessment interventions

86
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,455
and community resource navigations.

87
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:18,975
The enhanced definition of workflows and
responsibilities give a clear delineation

88
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:23,925
of roles with structure protocols
for SDOI screening interventions,

89
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,755
referrals, and follow up processes.

90
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:30,815
One more important aspect is the
ongoing performance evaluation, regular

91
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:34,985
assessment of team effectiveness
through metrics including intervention,

92
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:39,185
completion rates, and patient
outcomes and resource utilization has

93
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:41,495
also proven to be very beneficial.

94
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:47,225
Let's look at some analytics that are
related to SDOH risk stratification.

95
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:51,925
Advanced analytics enable healthcare
organizations to move beyond

96
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,855
reactive approaches to proactive
identification of social needs.

97
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:00,355
There are multi-dimensional
data sources that providers can

98
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:03,175
prioritize outreach to patients.

99
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:09,125
Let's look at what are they one pro
productive modeling machine learning

100
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:15,250
algorithms today provide 89% accuracy
in identifying high risk populations.

101
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:20,645
Integrating data by combining
clinical claims and community level

102
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:23,344
data sources is an important factor.

103
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:28,775
Geospatial analysis, how do we
track consensus, track data,

104
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,445
neighborhood level, SDH, risk mapping.

105
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:35,164
That is also a vital factor at the end.

106
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,025
Clinical data foundation.

107
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:42,185
The entire documentation that exists
in EHR and structural assessment is

108
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:48,605
important for overall analytics and risk
stratification done by SDOH framework.

109
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:55,555
Proper EHR integration also has shown to
enhance data quality by 45%, which is a

110
00:07:55,555 --> 00:08:00,975
significant improvement from the current
situation that is is aimed in today's.

111
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:05,405
Where referral accuracy and
care coordination shows sign

112
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,295
significant improvement.

113
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:13,265
Organizations implementing comprehensive
SDOH data standards report better

114
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,655
clinical decision making and more
effective resource allocation.

115
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:22,010
Let's look into some of the critical
factors, structured data capture.

116
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,640
How implementation of standard SDH
data, hand data elements like law and

117
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,640
SNOMED and ICD 10 ensures consistent
documentation and interoperability

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,260
across systems utilizing fire based
APIs and HSM standards facilitates

119
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,130
secure information sharing between
healthcare systems, community-based

120
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,530
organizations and public health entities.

121
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,160
Outcome tracking, creating dashboards
and reporting mechanisms to monitor

122
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,780
intervention effectiveness, referral
completion, and population level SDH

123
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,850
trends over time has been crucial.

124
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,890
Deploying automated alerts and
intervention pathways triggered by

125
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,850
the positive SDUH screenings with
tailored research recommendations

126
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,985
based on identifying needs as vital.

127
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:16,005
Studies also show that structured
community partnerships lead to 70% better

128
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:20,295
outcomes for vulnerable populations
compared to isolated interventions.

129
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:25,605
Successful healthcare organizations
invest in relationship development

130
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:29,835
with community-based organizations
to create sustainable support

131
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,355
networks addressing, excuse me,
addressing identified social needs.

132
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:39,095
Let's look at some of the
variations and factors involving

133
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:42,815
how community partnership
framework can be well can be done.

134
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:47,375
Resource mapping is number one,
comprehensive intervention inventory

135
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,795
of community resources with
capacity eligibility criteria and

136
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:55,240
service details is important of
how the resource mapping is done.

137
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,470
Formal partnership agreements,
structured MOUs, defining roles and

138
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,180
responsibility on how the data sharing
and sharing protocols have to be done.

139
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,689
How the agreements have to be
done is part of this framework,

140
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,569
shared outcome measurement.

141
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,200
But today, where everything is, the
data is not shared with this joint

142
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,570
evaluation frameworks, it helps to assess
partnership effectiveness and impact.

143
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,640
Let's look into what kind of
implementation strategies are IMP

144
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,070
are beneficial in a rural setup.

145
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,320
Number one being telehealth integration,
leveraging virtual care platforms

146
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
to extend SDOL, screening and
intervention capacity across geographic

147
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,955
barriers that improves significant
store and forward capabilities for

148
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,875
the nurses and healthcare workers.

149
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,670
The transportation issues
that are currently there.

150
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:55,430
SDOH implementation brings solutions to
that developing ride share partnerships,

151
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,410
volunteer driver programs, and mobile
health units to address distance barriers,

152
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,860
coordinating appointments, scheduling to
minimize travel burden through clustered

153
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,625
appointments and regional service hubs.

154
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,145
Alternative payment.

155
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:13,605
Payment models like out adopting
outcome-based reimbursement structures

156
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:18,255
that recognize SDH intervention
value with rural organizations

157
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:22,605
reporting 58 persons increase in
successful social interventions

158
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,610
through value-based care arrangements.

159
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,700
Let's look into what kind of technology
infrastructure requirements are

160
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:35,290
needed to implement this SDOH based
framework and healthcare system.

161
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,880
Number one, being a secure cloud
infrastructure, having a HIPAA t hosting

162
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,930
environments with role-based access
controls and end-to-end encryption

163
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,510
so that there is sensitive SDH
data is encrypted and is important.

164
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,210
For integration, any integration,
metalware requires an API management

165
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,610
platforms, which facilitate secure
data exchanges between EHR systems,

166
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,490
community resource directories,
and referral management tools.

167
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,940
Multi-channel access mobile applications,
and responsive web interfaces, enabling

168
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,500
SDO, screening and interventions across
diverse clinical and community settings.

169
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,270
Offline capabilities for rural areas
with limited connectivity is crucial.

170
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,320
Primacy framework is one more aspect.

171
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,370
Comprehensive consent management
systems addressing various

172
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,830
sharing requirements for SDOH.

173
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,400
Data granular permission structures,
allowing patients to control

174
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,830
information disclosure is vital.

175
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,410
Let's look at the implementation
roadmap and key success factors.

176
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,770
On a very high level, the program design
today takes about one to three months.

177
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,900
This involves assessing organizational
readiness, establishing governance

178
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,390
structure, and defining specific
SDH focus areas based on community

179
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,460
needs and organizational capacities.

180
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,700
The next set of months from
month four to month six, deals

181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,590
with infrastructure development.

182
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,000
We're implementing in technical
infrastructure, including EHR,

183
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,310
customization, analytics platform,
and developing standard workflows

184
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,840
and staff training programs.

185
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,855
That is where this month
four to six consists of.

186
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,215
Next comes the initial implementations.

187
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:29,735
From month seven to nine, launching
the pilot program with targeted

188
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:34,445
pa, targeted patient population,
establishing baseline metrics,

189
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:38,705
formalizing community partnerships,
and is involved in this phase.

190
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:44,765
Next comes expansion and optimization
in the following months scale to

191
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:49,085
full patient population, refining the
processes based on initial outcomes and

192
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:53,405
implementing advanced analytics that
we just went through for continuous

193
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:58,505
improvement and also developing
sustainable funding mechanisms.

194
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,670
All of this is a overview of how
an implementation roadmap and what

195
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,780
are the key success factors of
implementing SDH framework looks like.

196
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,820
Successful SDH implementation
hinges on executive leadership

197
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,140
commitment, dedicated resources,
and a culture of continuous crosses.

198
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,790
Quality improvement organizations
should establish clear metrics for

199
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,320
success, including clinical outcomes
by following the structured approach.

200
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:36,625
I hope I was able to provide you a high
level at yet a detailed overview of

201
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,935
SDOH and how the care delivery models
are ultimately improving health equity

202
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:46,465
and patient outcomes at the same time,
optimizing resource utilizations.

203
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:47,415
Thank you.
