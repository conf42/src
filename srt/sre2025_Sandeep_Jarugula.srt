00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,500
Hi, this is Sand ul.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,550
I'm a senior software unit and welcoming
you all, whoever joined in my talk.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,020
And here I'm going to present my
topic on Enhance cybersecurity with

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,330
multi authentication and zero trust.

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:18,495
Integrity models, and it's a data driven
approach to modern defense strategies

6
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:24,295
traditional secure systems to no longer
against sophisticated cyber threats.

7
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:30,235
So here we are going to discover how
MFA and Zero Trust frameworks works in

8
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:35,095
revolutionizing defense strategies and
saving millions in breach related costs.

9
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,845
So the rising cost of data breach.

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,529
Is gradually increasing by dollar 4.45
million average breach cost global figure.

11
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:48,059
It's a huge number for 2023 and 83%.

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,050
Identify related percentage of breach tied
to the identify compromise and dollar 3.92

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,809
million annual savings for organization
integrating MFA and Zero trust.

14
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,229
The financial impact of
breaches continues to rise.

15
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:08,835
Identify security has become
a critical vulnerability point

16
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:11,174
requiring immediate attention.

17
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:15,374
So here though, we can discuss
about the fundamentals of

18
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:16,966
multifactor authentications.

19
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:24,524
So in inherent factor like, which is like
biometrics and ion factors like token and

20
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:30,285
cards and knowledge factors with passport
and pins, where MFA creates multiple

21
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:34,035
verification layers, each factor provides.

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,860
And additional security barrier,
A against unauthorized access.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,230
The productive power of MFA is 99%
reduction in account Compromise the

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,929
items when MFA properly implemented.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,645
So let's discuss on
productive power of MFA and.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:57,365
Here, the financial impact of data
breaches continues to escalates,

27
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:02,554
so which identify security emerging
as a critical vulnerability point.

28
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:07,175
As a result, organizations must add up
advanced security framework to product

29
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,334
sense to data and mitigate risk.

30
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:14,395
So understanding of multifactor
authentications, so each additional.

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,440
Verification factor strengthens
security by creating multiple

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
barriers against unauthorized access.

33
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,430
So MFA is proven to reduce account
compromise the items by 99.9%, and

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,220
lower security incidents by 91%.

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,440
So compared to the systems relying on
password alone, so the effectiveness of

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,900
zero trust architecture in the next slide.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,920
So here in the zero trust architecture,
so one of the assumptions that one is

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,390
whether inside or outside the network is
it continuously verifies and authenticate

39
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,790
all the access requests to go less of.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,740
Requests like option.

41
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,300
So this originally ensures the
security is maintained at every

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,420
stage of user interactions.

43
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,000
So the zero trust framework have
been significantly reduce the attack

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,890
surface, prevents lateral moments, and
within networks and minimize breaches.

45
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,730
So organizations adopting Bureau trust.

46
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:23,635
See miserable improvements in
security and including reduced

47
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:28,675
successful attacks and more effect
to containing mental of deaths.

48
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:35,025
So the zero trust effectiveness matrix
here, the attack surface reduction and

49
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:42,105
surface and security incidents, and each
breach prevention rate and later moment.

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,570
So in the industry, specific benefits
such as improving by implementing

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:56,355
zero trust result in a 93% reduction
in Akon takeovers and dollar 1.87

52
00:03:56,355 --> 00:04:01,830
million in the annual savings
is a huge saving and a around 6%

53
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,720
decrease in fraud investigations.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,170
So healthcare benefits, like by using zero
trust reduction rate is 72% in reduction.

55
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,410
The.

56
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,120
In breaches and in product health
data and increases the hypo.

57
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:18,044
Compliance like faster than 88%.

58
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:24,735
So as compared to government sectors,
organizations are a 99%, 7% in classified

59
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:30,585
data and seven, 6% drop in unauthorized
access events, improving regulatory

60
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,415
compliance and overall security.

61
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:33,585
These results.

62
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,735
Demonstrate the significant security
improvements that can achieve by adopting

63
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:45,095
MFA and zero trust across different
factors and integration strategies for

64
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:51,720
MFA and zero Trust through successfully
integrate MFA and Zero Trust organization

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
should follow this picture approach.

66
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:58,835
So assessment like conducting is
comprehensive security audit to identify

67
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:05,015
vulnerabilities and access risk exposes
and strategy, development and design,

68
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:11,285
customized implementation plan with clear
goals and with and milestones, resource

69
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,655
allocations and access to buy-ins.

70
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,935
And other strategies in integrations or.

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,910
The pilot deployment and the rollout
control trial in a selected departments

72
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,240
and critical systems to test the
effectiveness of the solution.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,010
So faced implementation so
gradually expands the security

74
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,760
framework, provides prioritizing
critical assets first and while.

75
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,060
Adjusting based on real time feedback.

76
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,690
And continuously optimization is in
one of the integration technique.

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,550
So establish regular monitoring and
refinement to ensure the solution

78
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,470
evolves with emerging threats.

79
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,260
So here izing, tech authentication
technologies or, so these are

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,550
authentications, landscape is
evolving with new technologies.

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,830
That offer enhanced security
while minimizing user friction.

82
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,570
So passwordless authentication, so
eliminates the risk of associated

83
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,180
with the password based and securely
while using alternative measures like

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,539
biometric or smart devices and biometrics.

85
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,200
So advanced biological makers
such as fingerprints or.

86
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,430
Face shield, recognization, or
user for secure authentication

87
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,710
with anti proofing measures.

88
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,450
So behavior authentication, so
users machine learning to analyze

89
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,690
user behavior pattern and provide
continuous authentications.

90
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,270
So adapt to risk assessments, adjust
the security levels based on the

91
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:47,460
contextual factors such as users,
location, device, or activities.

92
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,664
So these innovations are crucial
for improving both security and user

93
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:57,974
experience, allowing more seamless
yet secure authentication process.

94
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:05,559
So let's continue to balancing security
and user experience and key takeaways for

95
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,240
the by implementing Hero trust and MFA.

96
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:09,364
Authentication.

97
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:14,315
So here adopting MFA and Zero Trust
for robust production integrates

98
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:19,114
MFA and Zero Trust frameworks to
safeguard agonist modern threats.

99
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:24,005
So pre prioritize user experience,
ENS ensures that secure measures

100
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:28,085
are implemented in a ways that
minimize friction for users.

101
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,445
Start with critical assessments.

102
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:35,814
So focus on producting, the most valuable
resources first, gradually expanding

103
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,304
to cover the entire organizations.

104
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:42,804
So measures and optimize,
continuously track security metrics

105
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:47,124
and return on investments to refine
strategies and improve outcomes.

106
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:52,344
So the evolving cybersecurity landscape
requires advanced defense strategies

107
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:55,405
by amortizing MFA and zero trust.

108
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,629
Organizations can significantly enhance
security, reduce breach related costs,

109
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,659
and stay ahead of emerging threats.

110
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,590
And thank you all who
have joined my section.
