00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,050
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,899
I am ti and today I will be discussing
our research on resilient health

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,279
monitoring system, specifically
engineered for disaster zone.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,669
The subtitle of my presentation
captures our core mission, transforming

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,279
proof of concept health monitoring.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,040
Into battle tested system capable of
operating when infrastructure fails.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,710
This is crucial work because
traditional health monitoring system

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,309
are designed for control environment
with reliable power and stable network

9
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,900
connectivity conditions that simply
doesn't exist in disaster zones.

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:49,765
When earthquake strikes, hurricane
hits, or other catastrophe occurs.

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,109
Conventional healthcare infrastructure
collapses precisely when it's necessary.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,150
Most, our research addresses this
challenge by re-imagining health

13
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:10,270
monitoring technology from the ground
up, focusing on resilience, power,

14
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,685
efficiency, and reliable communication.

15
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:18,970
Even in the most challenging
environment, the ultimate challenge.

16
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:24,505
When designing the health monitoring
for Disaster Zone, we face three

17
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:30,385
critical challenge challenges that form
what I call the ultimate challenge.

18
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:34,765
First, we need to provide
life critical monitoring.

19
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:40,380
This means tracking vital signs,
including heart rate, blood, oxygen

20
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,295
level, SPO two body temperature, and
respiratory functions parameters.

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,010
That can mean the difference
between life and death.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,660
Unlike consumer fitness tracking trackers
that can tolerate occasional inaccuracy,

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,690
our system must maintain clinical
accuracy even under extreme conditions.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,419
Second, we operate in hostile
environments when traditional

25
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,954
infrastructure has collapsed.

26
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,685
Think about post earthquake scenario.

27
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:20,605
When no power grid, no internet
connectivity, extreme temperature,

28
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:25,374
dust, and debris, our system must
continue functioning reliably

29
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,534
despite these conditions.

30
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:32,994
Finally, we are targeting 99.99% of time.

31
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:38,334
This means our system can only
afford about five minutes of

32
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:43,194
downtime per year when lives
depend on continuous monitoring.

33
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,489
This level of reliability isn't a
luxury, it's an absolute necessary.

34
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,409
The BLE connection, resilience.

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,245
To meet these challenges we have developed
several innovations in BLE Connection.

36
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:05,225
Resilience first are dynamic
device discovery enables automated

37
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:10,550
reconnection protocols that continuously
adapt to challenging environment.

38
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:19,895
This means that as healthcare providers
move patients or as condition changes, the

39
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:24,875
system automatically rebuilds connections
without requiring manual reconfiguration.

40
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,320
We have implemented multi-part
communication that ensures signal

41
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:33,695
persistence even when primary route fails.

42
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:39,275
Our field testing shows that
approaches has increased connection.

43
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,580
Reliability from 92.4% to 99.7% critical
improvement when lives are at stake.

44
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,470
The system includes sophisticated
signal degradation handling that

45
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,710
maintains core functionality even
at minimal signal strength, even at

46
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,920
signal levels as low as minus 95 DBM.

47
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,010
The system continues transmitting
essential vital signs.

48
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:11,945
Perhaps most importantly, our device
from mesh networks where they can rely

49
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:14,855
on data when direct connection fails.

50
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:20,495
This creates a self-healing network
architecture that can route around

51
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,835
damaged or disconnected nodes,
maintaining continuous monitoring

52
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:29,015
capabilities despite localized failure,

53
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,070
power optimization, breakthrough.

54
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:33,215
Yes.

55
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:38,045
Power management represents one of
our most significant innovations as

56
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:42,125
it directly impacts how long these
systems can operate in the field.

57
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:48,755
Our dynamic sensor sampling intelligently
varies collection frequency based

58
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:53,975
on the patient's criticality and
remain power reserve and remaining

59
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:57,395
power reserves for stable patients.

60
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:02,915
Sampling rates can decrease to conserve
power while critical patients are.

61
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,549
Monitoring more frequently.

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,000
This approach has demonstrated as a
remarkable 62.4% reduction in power

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,509
consumption for stable patients
while maintaining clinical standards.

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,609
We have implemented advanced edge
computing algorithm that analyzes

65
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,960
data locally drastically reducing
energy intensive transmissions.

66
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,549
This low power processing
approach has reduced ideal.

67
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,409
Current consumption, idle current
consumption from 4.2 milliamps

68
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:40,889
to just 0.8 milliamps and 81%
improvement that directly translates

69
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,270
to longer operational life.

70
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,849
Our transmission optimization
uses strategic compression and

71
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,969
scheduled data delivery protocols
to reduce radioactivity cycle by

72
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,919
coordinating transmission windows.

73
00:05:56,475 --> 00:06:01,455
Across multiple devices, we have
achieved a 28.3% reduction in

74
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:06,405
overall power consumption as compared
to standard BLE implementation.

75
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:11,325
Finally, we have integrated innovative
energy harvesting technology that captures

76
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:14,295
kinetic thermal and ambient RF energy.

77
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:19,425
These micro generators create
self-sustained power systems

78
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,375
that can extend operational.

79
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,980
Duration by 18 to 26% under
favorable conditions, potentially

80
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,880
providing indefinite operation
in some field settings.

81
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,280
OTA update in constrained networks.

82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,820
Maintaining software currently in
a currently is vital for security

83
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,409
and functionality, but traditionally
update mechanism, traditional update

84
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,690
mechanism fails in disaster environment.

85
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,770
With limited connectivity, our
Delta update approach transmits

86
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,459
only modified components rather
than complete firmware images.

87
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:07,229
This reduces bandwidth demand by over 80%
with typical update payload size, dropping

88
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:14,879
from 48 to 96 KB to just eight to 12 kb.
This efficiency is critical when network

89
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,249
resources are severely constrained.

90
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,809
We have developed proprietary extreme
compression algorithm that can

91
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,049
shrink update payloads by nearly 83%.

92
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,209
This enables critical patches, even
on severely limited network, the

93
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,459
traditional updates would be impossible.

94
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,279
Our partial update recovery use
sophisticated checkpointing to

95
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:43,454
allow interruptions, interrupted
updates to resume from break points.

96
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,574
This eliminates redundancy.

97
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:53,399
Data transfer during network fluctuation,
ensuring updates are complete even

98
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,859
with intermittent connectivity.

99
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,689
Finally, our intelligent rollback
safety mechanism automatically

100
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,729
reverts to the last stable version
if deployment integrity check fields.

101
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,419
This ensures continuous device operation
even when updates, encounter problems

102
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,739
with field testing demonstrated in 92.2%.

103
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,749
First attempt update success rate.

104
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,649
Next, let's talk about
distributed observability.

105
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:28,019
Maintaining visibility into the
system performance is crucial

106
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,039
in disaster scenarios, but
traditional monitoring approach fail

107
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,809
without reliable infrastructure.

108
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:40,260
Our system provides comprehensive
real time virtualization visualization

109
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:45,210
across all deployed monitoring
devices in the disaster zone.

110
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,935
This gives emergency responders
and medical personal immediate

111
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:53,375
insights to, into both system
health and patient status.

112
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:59,295
We have implemented dis distributed
tracing capabilities that provide

113
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:04,490
crucial visibility into patient
interaction during network destruction.

114
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:08,625
This allows us to maintain
accountability and data integrity

115
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,395
despite challenging conditions.

116
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,540
Our advanced machine learning algorithms
can provide identify potential system

117
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,430
failures and psychological emergency
before critical incident records.

118
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,759
Field testing shows our system can
detect deterioration of two 13 point five

119
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:31,469
minutes before conventional indicators,
potential life saving, early warning.

120
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,050
Finally, our intelligent bandwidth
optimization prioritization,

121
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,459
transmission of life.

122
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:43,545
Critical metrics when communication
infrastructure is severely compromised.

123
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:48,435
This ensures that most important
data gets through even when

124
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,564
bandwidth is extremely limited

125
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:59,204
error Budgeting for critical care,
we have adopted the site reliability

126
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:04,604
engineering concept of error budgeting to
ensure our system maintaining, maintain.

127
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:10,725
Approximately reliability, appropriate
reliability for different functions.

128
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:18,135
For overall system reliability, we have
targeted 99.9%, which means a maximum

129
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,325
downtime of just five minutes per year.

130
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:24,915
This ensures that healthcare providers
can depend on the system being available

131
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:30,345
when needed for critical alert delivery
notification that can be lifesaving.

132
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,125
We aim even higher with 99 point.

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,020
Nine, nine, 9% reliability target.

134
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,599
This translates to less than one minute
of annual downtime For these critical

135
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,209
functions for non-critical function, we
allow slightly more flexible flexibility.

136
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,640
With a 98.5% target, the strategic
approach allows more innovation in

137
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,310
secondary features while maintaining
the ionic lag reliability for

138
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,319
the most important capability.

139
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:08,864
This error budgeting approach ensures that
we focus our reliable efforts where they

140
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:14,354
matter most on the functions that directly
impact patient safety and outcomes.

141
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:17,810
Healthcare specific SLIs and SLOs.

142
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:22,435
We have developed healthcare
specific service level indicators

143
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:28,644
and service level objectives that
directly relate to clinical outcomes.

144
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:34,944
For vital sick sign latency, we
target less than one second with a

145
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,744
critical threshold of three seconds.

146
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:42,534
This ensures that healthcare providers
are working with current patient data,

147
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:46,974
not historical information that might
no longer reflect patient's status.

148
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:52,524
Alert delivery type is even
more stringent with a target of

149
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:56,844
less than 200 milliseconds and a
critical threshold of two seconds.

150
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:02,994
When a patient's condition deteriorates
every second counts and rapid alerts

151
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:06,805
enable fast inter intervention.

152
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:13,884
Data accuracy targets 99.5% with
a critical threshold of 98.5%.

153
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:19,494
This high standard ensure that
critical decisions are based on

154
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:25,269
trustworthy information, reducing risk,
reducing the risk of treatment error.

155
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:31,299
Finally, battery life prediction
accuracy aims for a plus minus 5%

156
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:36,279
error with a critical threshold
of plus minus 10% Accurate battery

157
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,299
prediction prevents unexpected device
failure that could leave patient

158
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,969
unmonitored during the critical periods.

159
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,979
These healthcare specific metrics
ensures that our system meets

160
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,579
the unique requirement of medical
monitoring in disaster in the.

161
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:52,209
Minutes,

162
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,379
graceful degradation patterns.

163
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:01,810
When resource become constrained,
our system implements sophisticated

164
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,709
graceful degradation patterns
to maintain essential functions.

165
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,800
Our priority based functions
shedding disabled non-essential

166
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
features first, as resource es.

167
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,599
Preserving critical monitoring
functions until absolute failure.

168
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:20,499
This means.

169
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,449
Capabilities, like high resolution
wave or historical data access

170
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,000
might be reduced before vital signs.

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,110
Monitor is affected.

172
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,870
Data resolution scaling dynamically
adjust sampling rates and precise

173
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,430
precision based on patient status.

174
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:43,730
This mainten maintains higher resolution
for abnormal readings, ensures

175
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,040
critical accuracy when it matters
most while conserving resources.

176
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:55,265
On stable patients, our first, our
local first processing approach

177
00:13:55,564 --> 00:14:00,185
shifts to autonomous operations when
disconnected from central infrastructure.

178
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:05,135
Local alerting continues without
central system ensuring patient

179
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,645
monitoring continues even when
the network fails completely.

180
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:15,935
Finally across, finally, across cross
device redundancy allows nearby devices

181
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,604
to assure monitoring reliability.

182
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,410
For failing units, patient data is
seamlessly transferred between devices.

183
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,814
Maintaining continuous monitoring,
even when individual component fails,

184
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,660
real world impact.

185
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,850
Our system has already demonstrated
significant real world impact

186
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,260
across multiple scenarios.

187
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:42,949
During the Napal earthquake, we
successfully monitored over 5,000

188
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,430
patients across 15 market makeshift field.

189
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,090
Hospitals with 99.3% of time during
critical disaster response operation.

190
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,310
This provides continuous continuity
of care despite complete collapsed

191
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,000
infrastructure, enabling more
efficient triage and resource

192
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,970
allocation following Hurricane Maria.

193
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,080
Our system was rapidly deployed
when hospital infrastructure

194
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,030
collapsed, providing 17,000 patient
hours of uninterrupted vital.

195
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,250
Monitoring in an extreme condition.

196
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,050
This allows healthcare providers to
focus on treatment rather than manually

197
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,720
monitoring, significantly improving the
efficiency of limited medical personnel

198
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,360
beyond immediate disaster response.

199
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,310
Our technology has transformed
healthcare delivery by extending

200
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,440
critical monitoring capabilities
to facilitate 200 facilities in.

201
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,530
Underserved regions without reliable
power infrastructure to demonstrate how

202
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:51,440
innovation driven by extreme requirements
can broader impact on global healthcare,

203
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,350
across global healthcare access.

204
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,890
Key takeaways to conclude,
I want to emphasize that SRE

205
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,390
principles can transform healthcare
technology, reliability, and

206
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,120
extreme conditions when human lives.

207
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Lives depends on uptime.

208
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,410
Traditionally reliable standards
and approach simply aren't enough.

209
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,160
Our research demonstrate that through
focus, innovation, and in connection,

210
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,079
reliance in connection, reliance, power
optimization, update mechanism, and g

211
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,954
graceful degradation, we can create health
monitoring system that functions reliably

212
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:36,115
even in the most challenging environment.

213
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,870
The impact extends beyond immediate
disaster response, potentially

214
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,699
transforming healthcare delivery
in resource constraint environments

215
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:52,009
worldwide, and establishing new
standards for medical device reliability.

216
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,650
Thank you for your attendance.

217
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,439
I'm happy to take any questions about
our research or the specific technical

218
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,015
approaches that we have developed.

219
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,740
Thank you again.

220
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:04,505
