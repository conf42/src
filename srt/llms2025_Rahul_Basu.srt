1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,060
Hello, my name is Rahul Basu, and today
I'm gonna talk about ai, Hollywood, and

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,710
Metaverse, and how we can find synergy in
these two technologies and one location.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,340
as we know, historically in the
entertainment industry, we have

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,380
seen, technology be at the forefront
of the advancements, whether it

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,069
is CGI or virtual reality or VFX.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,380
So Hollywood has always been at the
forefront of, any cutting edge technology.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,910
the.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,170
The rapid development of AI lately
is now, creating a transformative

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,230
force in Hollywood, including,
the immersive metaverse.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,500
We can already see that AI is
revolutionizing multiple aspects of

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,100
content creation from script writing,
and digital actors to audience

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,380
engagement and film marketing.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,240
Similarly, metaverse is enabling
immersive storytelling, interactive

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,300
experiences, and dynamic digital worlds.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,010
So what can AI do for filmmaking?

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,150
we see that AI is revolutionizing
filmmaking by enhancing content

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,370
creation, performance simulation,
storytelling, and distribution.

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,150
It assists in script writing,
pre-visualization, and post-production

19
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,990
tasks like VFX and sound engineering.

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,880
we also see that there are AI driven
digital humans, voice synthesis

21
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,250
and casting recommendations.

22
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,670
To improve performance realism?

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,240
the other point is about AI generated
NPCs or non-player characters and

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,500
metaverse world building tools are
enhancing, the ability to create

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,840
interactive storytelling in the metaverse.

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,470
Content distribution benefits from
AI based recommendations, real time

27
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,900
dubbing and predictive analytics.

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,900
And at the same time, neural networks are
enabling immersive interactions, including

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,540
gesture recognition and eye tracking.

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,939
AI is also helping enhance music
composition and background scoring,

31
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,390
enriching cinematic experiences with
dynamic and adaptive sound design.

32
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,670
What would probably never be happening
in the future, we would probably

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,609
never see a fully autonomous AI
generated movie as AI will probably

34
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,230
only serve as an assistive tool.

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,399
For human creators rather than a complete
replacement of creative individuals.

36
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,929
And there are some really big
people, who are known for the movies

37
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,739
they make, the movies they direct.

38
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,789
we do see that neural networks, sorry,
neural interfaces like brain computer.

39
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:58,154
Interaction.

40
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:05,024
They, have been a long term inspiration,
but direct brain to AI integration is

41
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:09,734
probably beyond scope in the tech, in the
current technology, realm of technology.

42
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:16,374
we'll never see something like a daydream
get converted to a movie or a TV series.

43
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:22,014
Now, how do we even build something
like this that includes, ai, metaverse,

44
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:24,314
and yeah, good old filmmaking.

45
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,139
It'll probably have three.

46
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:30,619
primary layers and the
two software components.

47
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,159
So the three primary layers would be
content creation, production layer, the

48
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,979
first one, which would include AI powered
tools for filmmaking and creative media.

49
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,804
The second one would then be a.
Metaverse experience layer that focuses

50
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:53,454
on AI driven storytelling, non-player
characters and immersive environments.

51
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:59,564
And the third one, we would probably have
something like an AI distribution and

52
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:05,104
personalization layer that would enhance
user engagement with recommendation

53
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,994
engines and adaptive storytelling.

54
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:13,254
The key software components would
include an AI script writing engine.

55
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:20,334
Ai, pre-visualization and storyboarding
interactive storytelling engine and

56
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:23,574
AI generated environments for VFX.

57
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:29,324
Additional features include
post-production automation, digital

58
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:34,484
humans, real-time dubbing, personalized
recommendations, and predictive

59
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:39,614
analytics, ensuring a fully integrated
and dynamic content experience.

60
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,184
A lot of this was already happening today.

61
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:48,534
this is, a tech stack slide that I tried
to, Accu accumulate through my research.

62
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,284
a lot of these tools are new.

63
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:55,304
A lot of these products probably would do
something else in the future, than what

64
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:59,294
they do today, or they would probably
be even better at what they are today.

65
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,574
but if you wanna take a look
at the technologies that, that.

66
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,114
Cater to all of these layers individually.

67
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,904
This would probably be the slide for you.

68
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:12,714
So I'm gonna leave, just a
couple of seconds in case you

69
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:13,644
guys wanna have a look at it.

70
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:17,044
And I'm happy to answer any question
that you might have later on these.

71
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:20,394
Now, Hollywood is all
about creativity, right?

72
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,254
So how do we streamline this process?

73
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:27,114
we do see that, AI is transforming
Hollywood by streamlining

74
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,844
filmmaking processes, from script
writing to post-production.

75
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:35,164
there are tools in the, that have
been built using AI that are analyzing

76
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:39,724
scripts and identifying audience
preferences based on that analysis,

77
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:44,794
suggesting dialogue and story arcs and
assisting writers in brainstorming.

78
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:50,944
These pre-visualization technology,
products help directors and producers

79
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:55,594
generate scene previews, thereby
reducing costs for complex projects

80
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,904
in the post-production world.

81
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:04,114
AI automates, tasks like color greeting,
visual effects and sound editing.

82
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:10,284
Machine learning software can also
help DH actors remove unwanted

83
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:13,074
objects and enhance audio seamlessly.

84
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:18,364
All of these currently happen
and the latest movies use

85
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,594
all of these technologies.

86
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:21,034
that being said.

87
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:26,319
it's important to remember that AI
will never probably replace creatives.

88
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,459
it'll only serve as a tool
to improve efficiency.

89
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,999
cutting costs and optimizing
the filmmaking workflow.

90
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,039
And I'm a strong believer of this.

91
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,789
So now the important bit,
the casting and performances.

92
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:49,369
AI is revolutionizing casting and
performance technology by offering new

93
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:52,189
opportunities for filmmakers and actors.

94
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,969
virtual actors and AI generated
characters are enabling realistic

95
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:02,249
performances without human presence
even as much as portraying roles

96
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,899
impossible for real actors.

97
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,389
Facial recognition advancements
are allowing studios to create,

98
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,209
to, recreate actors as well, for a
scene in the flashback or new roles.

99
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,459
though there are some
ethical concerns around that.

100
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,234
but overall AI driven costing tools are
helping analyze audience preferences.

101
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,979
Past performances and character
requirements, thereby helping

102
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,169
directors, find the ideal actors.

103
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,829
These innovations enhance storytelling
possibilities, expanding creative

104
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,479
horizons in the film industry.

105
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,119
So the important people, the audience,
the viewer, streaming platforms

106
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,289
are known to use AI to analyze
user behavior, providing personal

107
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,749
recommendations to keep audiences engaged.

108
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:01,059
We probably already do that really well,
but AI would also enable interactive

109
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:05,679
storytelling, allowing viewers to
make choices that shape the storyline.

110
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,129
Introducing a gamified and
entertainment experience.

111
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,859
Additionally, there would be tools.

112
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:17,839
There are already tools that help
generate real time subtitles and

113
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,249
dubbing in multiple languages.

114
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:28,249
So every movie is good to go in China,
in Japan, in European countries,

115
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,199
even if it's shot in English.

116
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:35,364
So this helps, improve accessibility
and fostering culture and exchange.

117
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,564
yeah, that's already happening.

118
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:42,694
So how would now AI impact
film marketing distribution?

119
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,439
We have made the movie, it's beautiful.

120
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,524
How would it impact film
marketing and distribution?

121
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:52,724
I believe that, AI would, Provide more
than the data driven insights that

122
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:58,094
are currently done because predictive
analytics would help studios forecast

123
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:04,694
box office success, identifying
target demographics, and optimize the

124
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:06,404
marketing strategies based on that.

125
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:10,724
And this would help reduce
financial risks for studios.

126
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:16,204
AI can also help you in generating
multiple tailored versions of trailers,

127
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:22,094
for different audience segments
and maximizing engagement and an AI

128
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:27,114
power translation and localization,
would appeal to global audience and

129
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:29,184
expand films marketing potential.

130
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:34,504
These things would help, in turn,
streamline marketing efforts, improve

131
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:39,034
resource allocation and enhance
audience connection, making films more

132
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:43,474
accessible and appealing across diverse
cultural and linguistic barriers.

133
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:48,814
So thereby making every film a global
success, I believe that should happen.

134
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:49,334
yeah.

135
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,574
What does the future.

136
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,274
AI hold in Hollywood.

137
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:59,154
we do know that AI is transforming
Hollywood, by enhancing storytelling,

138
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:03,534
production, and creativity while
maintaining the human touch.

139
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:09,024
The industry's challenge is to balance
innovation with artistic integrity.

140
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:14,384
AI is also playing a pivotal role
in shaping the metaverse, powering

141
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:18,774
immersive experiences and dynamic
vir vi virtual environments.

142
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:23,274
It's rapid evolution, which is
driven by deep learning, and

143
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:27,384
mainly transformers is revolution
revolutionizing multiple fields.

144
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,304
So the early applications such as
voice assistance and autonomous

145
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:33,859
systems were impressive.

146
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:38,864
But the next generation, of AI
products including, which are

147
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:42,744
probably built with the GPD four,
which showcase exponential growth.

148
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:47,834
I believe that AI's role in
entertainment and technology will

149
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:54,344
only expand, redefining how stories
are told and experience in the

150
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,844
digital and the physical worlds.

151
00:10:56,344 --> 00:11:03,174
So what would immersive interfaces
add to the movie watching experience?

152
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:09,164
I believe that it would, help
transform human interactions, and

153
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:10,634
include them in the virtual world.

154
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:16,124
So things like gesture recognition,
emotion analysis would enhance

155
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:20,384
natural communication, making
digital experiences more intuitive.

156
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:24,805
I. we all know that eye tracking
technology is optimizing VR rendering

157
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:30,624
by focusing high resolution visuals
where users look improving immersion

158
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,025
while reducing computational demands.

159
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:38,645
So overall, I would say that, the
metaverse is a transformative shift

160
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:43,115
in human technology interaction
with AI as its foundation.

161
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:49,965
AI is definitely powering storytelling
guide to creation infrastructure, and

162
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:54,285
immersive experiences shaping every
aspect of the metaverse world, right?

163
00:11:54,795 --> 00:12:00,885
But as AI advances its influence,
will expand, merging human creativity

164
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:05,535
with the machine intelligence to
build unprecedented digital worlds.

165
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:10,384
The synergy between AI and the
metaverse unlocks in the middlest

166
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:15,574
possibilities behaving the way for
innovative experiences and opportunities.

167
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:21,954
This evolution signals the dawn
of a new era where imagination and

168
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:27,489
technology converge, redefining how
we engage with virtual environments.

169
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,739
The journey into this AI driven
