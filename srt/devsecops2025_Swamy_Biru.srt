00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,899
ideas into impactful technology.

4
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:15,899
We're excited to be at Kyle 42 and
share some of the work we've been

5
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:21,014
doing, securing AI during financial
operations systems at scale.

6
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:25,924
Investment banking operations demand
bulletproof security alongside efficiency.

7
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:30,424
This presentation reveals how we
implemented a security first enhanced

8
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:35,574
agent, ai clean work that transforms
middle office operations, enterprise

9
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,349
grade security standards, the

10
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,159
security impaired, the challenge.

11
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,699
Financial institutions face
an uncomfortable issue.

12
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:48,230
Traditional security families were
never designed for complexities

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,999
of agents and AI systems.

14
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:54,199
Three, AI capability introduced
attack vectors within

15
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,969
existing traditional systems.

16
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:59,990
Where do you secure a system where
decisions emerge from probabilistic

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,480
models rather than deterministic needs?

18
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:04,699
How do you maintain compliance when.

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,789
AI agents autonomously feed and synthesize
information from vast knowledge basis.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,800
Power approach.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,260
Security must be embedded in
architecture for not bolted on.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,410
Using means treating every component
of the AI pipeline as a potential

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,190
vulnerability and designing accordingly
to careful architecture, rigorous dev

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,970
practices, and continuous refinement.

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,460
We created a platform that process
enormous transaction volumes while

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,170
maintaining security standards
that exceed industry benchmarks.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,395
When an ai, the knowledge base, the Red
Cross passes through multiple validation

41
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,525
layers before any information is released.

42
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,165

Log every interaction.

49
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:04,295
For compiles secure transmission, you can
retrieve information through transmission.

50
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:07,675
Orchestration and
consensus and zero trust.

51
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,785
Specialized agents shared

52
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:16,405
assessment, communication,
section handling, operational.

53
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:22,490
Each agent operate within a strictly
defined school, principles of least

54
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,125
privilege, consensus mechanism.

55
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:29,685
High stakes decisions require agreement
across multiple specialized agents.

56
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:35,675
Execution agent by proposed action that
compli to risk and operation agents must

57
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,855
independently before execution proceeds.

58
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,905

And optimized architecture.

130
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,020
We have proven that security and
performance are complimentary

131
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,090
rather than competing objectives.

132
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,740
Our system maintains some second

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,590
Key lessons learned,
security from inception.

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Retro fitting security into
an architecture design without

136
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,820
it is far more difficult than
building security from the start.

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,850
Treat security as first class requirement,
align their functionality and performance.

138
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,010
Human oversight remains critical.

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,470
The right balance involves
clear Donation of AI handles

140
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,720
autonomously versus human judgment.

141
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,745
With rapid escalation path, like AI
encounters uncertainty, cultural success

142
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:56,545
requires transparent communication,
training programs, environment of

143
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:58,665
operation staff and AI system design.

144
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:05,295
Demonstration of all how ai, rather than
replaces human expertise, def defense.

145
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,415
The threat landscape involves constantly
security systems themselves must learn

00:09:58,755 --> 00:09:59,640
It's happening now.

162
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,930
Responsibility is to ensure
that transformation strengthened

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
rather than weakness.

164
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,140
The security posture of financial
institutions start with security.

Security throughout your architecture
from day one, continuous process.

166
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,110
Treat security as ongoing.

167
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,760
Evolution, not destination.

168
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,110
Invest in culture, build the people
and culture needed to make it work.

169
