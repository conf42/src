1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Everyone, good afternoon, good
morning, and good evening.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,360
Whatever the time is on today.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm pretty much so happy that we are going
to discuss about the quantifying RIRI,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,940
TE management and how AI implementation
transform of financial in 2025.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,810
So this is the one of the
pretty good topic, which I'm

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,440
pretty much looking forward and
looking pretty much interested.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,085
To see how it's going to help
the human kind or humans or

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:33,065
whatever, whoever is going to get
the more benefits using this ai.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,575
Okay, which one of the
primary example is myself?

10
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:41,664
Which I'm getting benefit through AI
all the time with respect to the system.

11
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:46,494
At the same time, how is helping me in the
real time at the same time, how is helping

12
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,684
me in both personal and personal ways?

13
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,234
Which we can discuss in
this making decision.

14
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:55,224
The primary focus should be on
the financial services, how AE is

15
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:59,184
helping the banking sector or other,
any other tech sector, which we are

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,474
going to discuss in this meeting.

17
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:01,794
Okay, thank you.

18
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:02,964
Let's delve into this one.

19
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,879
If we can see the, my
first slide quantifying RI.

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,070
If you see the synopsis here,
the financial service industry

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,020
has witnessed unprecedented.

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,490
Transformation through strategic
AI implementation with the global

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,510
enrichment facing 1 42 0.83 billion.

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,100
This is reflecting year's crucial
to in aging traditional financial

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,460
operations and driving industry
enhancements why AI tion so rapidly

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,885
simply, let's put the next slide.

27
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,165
Okay.

28
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:38,105
Yeah, simply put it
delivers tangible deals.

29
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:43,295
A driven automation has imposed
operational efficiency by 35%,

30
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:47,795
streamlining the routine process such
as account creation, consolidation,

31
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:50,285
transaction processing, and data entry.

32
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:54,575
Financial institution like JP
Morgan Chase, for example, have

33
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:58,355
successfully deferred a to automate
loan approvals and account verification

34
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:01,550
process, significantly reducing
manual labor and human error.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,350
Just think about this.

36
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:08,070
Within this year itself, we are
seeing 33% of operational efficiency,

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,110
as we discussed about right now.

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,300
The example of JP Morgan Chase has
a split A to automate loan approvals

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,420
and the verification process,
it used to take so much of time.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,339
Previously we go for any loan approval.

41
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,019
The initial process surface, they
used to take minimum two weeks, the

42
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,180
maximum of four weeks or five weeks.

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,310
Now it came down to less than a week.

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,089
It is saying so much of time for the
bank at the same time saying so much

45
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,800
time for that end user customer.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,789
Also at the same time ation
process, but this having so much

47
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:42,659
of manual labor and human error
that is cutting so much of term.

48
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,899
Okay, coming back to the next finance,
what I'm saying is much of 15%.

49
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:48,829
Okay.

50
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:52,319
In general, the financial forecasting
will be done by the most of

51
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,479
the companies across the world.

52
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:54,784
Out of that.

53
00:02:55,054 --> 00:03:01,204
We can see right now in this effect
25 25, we are seeing the 15% with ai.

54
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:05,734
Like for example, if they take
Goldman Sachs, but it's one of the

55
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:09,355
biggest company to market fluctuations
and budget needs unprecedented.

56
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,915
Additionally, a systems have reduced
data processing errors about 20%.

57
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,915
Is your team taking
example of Goldman Sachs?

58
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,170
Everyone will follow.

59
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,845
The Goldman says Complete what?

60
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:25,345
They provide their predictions
about the market, either or contract

61
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,805
India, sorry, these are Nasdaq here.

62
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:31,185
Do here about the New York where
we, everyone eagerly wait to see

63
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,125
what's going to the predictions for
tomorrow or day after the next week.

64
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:34,995
Other we everything.

65
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:40,545
So instead of Goldmans has used to spend
so much of manual hours, now they onboard

66
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:46,335
with a. They're able to provide the
accurate information with AI and then the

67
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:48,645
pressure also so accurate and so good.

68
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:53,905
That's the reason a is going to be
the game changer or the path breaker,

69
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:57,864
whatever your name, it's going to help
the humankind in much better ways.

70
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:58,825
Okay.

71
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,114
Let's go to the next slide.

72
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:02,785
Okay.

73
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,225
Ex, exactly.

74
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,755
And then let's go to.

75
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,525
When we are talking about all this
technical architecture about how A is

76
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,040
going to help, I dive into three parts.

77
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,360
Generative A and security protocol.

78
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,654
That's because I was a. How it
going to help central to these

79
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:25,495
achievements is sophisticated technical
architecture anchored by the generator.

80
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:31,135
A systems capable crossing over
1.2 million tokens per second.

81
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:35,365
We're talking about 1.2 million
tokens per second, transform

82
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:38,544
customer interactions and ending
into deeply present experiences.

83
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:43,795
Banks like HSBC's now employ advanced
chart bots for customer service,

84
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:48,565
providing immediate tire response
based on a real time, and also customer

85
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,515
profiles and financial behaviors.

86
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:56,824
Okay, so think think about what we are
doing with the h SBCs Bank and they

87
00:04:56,824 --> 00:05:02,884
have any number of transitions, all time
going on the general way we can validate

88
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:07,414
and monitor, we can remove the analysis
and we can develop so many agents.

89
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,926
I can talk about so much of AA
agents, which we are right now,

90
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,034
the going on across the world.

91
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:13,834
That agency is going to help.

92
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:18,664
And then with the agents, we are going
to processing 1.3 million to per second.

93
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:23,494
It being said, it cannot be done with
the human, can be done with the A only.

94
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:29,374
So with the help of aa, because we see a
kind of, banks are using the third parts.

95
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,649
For customer service.

96
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,209
I'm saying a agents, which is going
to change, but we can talk about chart

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,069
parts or agents, whatever you name it.

98
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:41,659
Those going to provide that providing
immediate tire responsibility

99
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,539
on the real time of customer
profiles and financial bills.

100
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:49,009
Seriously, if you're doing something
right previously, if you send any

101
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,924
request to the bank, it'll take
24 to 48 hours or more than that.

102
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:57,064
To get a response with the chart parts,
what we are going to develop with the

103
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:01,599
generative AI and agents, what we are
going to go and discuss more of what

104
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,574
we're going to see much more in future.

105
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:08,824
Those will change the banking sector
completely like how the processing like

106
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,654
one point million tokens per second.

107
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,399
Let's go to the one more
called creative analytics.

108
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:18,154
Where predict actually in general
water about what's going to happen

109
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:21,694
with the data water we have with the
actuals, what we call the actuals.

110
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:25,689
So with the actual set we can see,
okay for three years or four years, it

111
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,119
used to take so much of time and the
human interactions at the same time,

112
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,589
lot of labor and then everyone need to
spend so much of time to analyzing the

113
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,859
what happened for the past three years
and then come up with the numbers.

114
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,659
What's going to happen
in the next three years.

115
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,039
And then we don't know how much
that with the ai, if you're

116
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,169
providing that predictive analytics.

117
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:47,799
Okay.

118
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:51,669
Approximately, there's 2.5 petabytes
of data financially, daily.

119
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,129
In respect of any bank, the number
you can at number 2.5 petabytes,

120
00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:00,969
it's equal to thousands of digital
libraries for entrance enrichment.

121
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:06,099
Firms like BlackRock utilize breakthrough
analytics to swiftly identify emerging

122
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,629
trends, anticipate marketing shift
and manage risk culturally securing

123
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,189
a robust portfolio performance.

124
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:18,339
Even market, BlackRock is one of the
biggest emission firms, which they're

125
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:22,384
using a breakthrough analytics they
used to do previously as well, but

126
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:24,109
with a lot of human intervention.

127
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:29,509
The lever now with leveraging
this analytics with a. It's

128
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,979
pretty much game changing.

129
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:35,419
And then the title also
so good and accurate.

130
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:40,339
And if you need to think about that as
a language, you're doing the everything

131
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,699
like generative ai, creative analytics,
you should not forget about security.

132
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,764
Security is one of the key factor
where whatever things you're doing,

133
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,559
you need to be under secured.

134
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,209
Otherwise you'll see so much of anomalies
and their data and everything will

135
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,099
go to the other spaces and it'll be.

136
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,629
The world as well.

137
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,169
So that's the reason we
need to consider security.

138
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,469
It's a paramount in financial
services, AI implementation in

139
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:10,519
corporate advanced, multi-layered
encryption and quantum algorithms

140
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,499
to secure sensitive information.

141
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:17,704
Institution like Visa have AI
driven cybersecurity protocols,

142
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:21,514
drastically reducing security breaches
and enduring strict compliance

143
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,464
with the global financial ions.

144
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:28,919
So we need to make sure if you're
using generative AI or analytics, the

145
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,959
security must be for all the time.

146
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,564
So that means you need to think
about security when you're

147
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,064
thinking about generative aid.

148
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:39,634
Either it's chat bot or agents,
whatever you are going to use.

149
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:43,264
To ease the process, you need to
think about security because you're

150
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,334
talking about the individual PI data.

151
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:50,314
We need to always should be SOX
compliant and then we should make

152
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:54,664
sure we are under security guidelines,
like how each company is spending

153
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,244
some billions of data and security.

154
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,594
That's where we to make sure our end
users are stakeholders that should be

155
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:06,034
much more secure and nothing can be
done with them, any of these anomalies.

156
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:07,414
Okay.

157
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,404
The next one, anti money laning impact.

158
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:19,424
So maybe right now we are seeing some AI
has notably anti-money Laning AM practices

159
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:23,444
a power a m Returns now bo, over 83.5.

160
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:27,824
Catalyst accuracy in threat detection,
identifying social security financial

161
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:31,004
crimes that previously went unnoticed.

162
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,744
We are, right now, we are seeing so, so
we're seeing so many financial crimes.

163
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,454
But even we don't know what's going to
ha what's going to happen, what happened

164
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:45,134
previously because of, we don't have a
at the time, but the AI is on board now.

165
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:51,164
We are seeing 83.5% of the protection
identifying so sophisticated financial

166
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:53,264
crimes that previously went unnoticed.

167
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:58,489
Financial institutions such as CD Bank
have significantly reduced false by

168
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:03,009
65% stimulating complaints, operations,
and improving customer experiences.

169
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:08,309
Additionally, risk assessments at
major banks have accelerated by two

170
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:14,489
40% turning lengthy investigation
into efficient rapid response process.

171
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:21,209
Okay, this, we need to talk about this
A ML anti-money laundering practices.

172
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,949
That's where we know about money
landing, what kind of so many things

173
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,439
we had previously with the ai.

174
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,669
We can get rid of all this money
landing practices because AI is more

175
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,569
powerful and secure if you follow
all the security process with that.

176
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:43,270
We can see that 83.5% of the reduction
and followed by the identifying the

177
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:46,454
financial crimes, which previously
completely unnoticed even.

178
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:51,104
We don't know some financial crimes
are happening because of how much good

179
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:56,464
there are about all these things, but
with the a for should we can get rid

180
00:10:56,464 --> 00:11:00,994
of all of these things so that the
transactions should be pretty clean and.

181
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:05,974
All the way we have transparency in the
address between the banks to the customer

182
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:10,564
B2B, B2C are technical companies, whoever
the companies is going to leverage this.

183
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:15,814
A entry, money landing practices
that will help them a lot.

184
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:19,785
And then looking forward
let's go next one.

185
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:21,119
Okay.

186
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,359
What will be the future
of the banking system?

187
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,319
That's one thing.

188
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,759
Pretty much I'm looking forward.

189
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,180
Okay.

190
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:33,089
The looking forward is influence will
continue to expand by 2027, maybe nearby,

191
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:39,089
or it may take much little bit more time,
but A is projected to handle approximately

192
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,609
85% of 14 banking transactions.

193
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:46,829
For example, Wells Fargo, for instance,
is actively moving forward this future.

194
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,929
Implementing advanced automated
systems to manage routine transactions.

195
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:56,040
Freeing financial advisors to
focus on personality, financial

196
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,109
planning, and complex customer needs.

197
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,780
So right now, if you go to any of the
bank, you may see multiple people and each

198
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,599
person have that so many responsibilities.

199
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,620
And sometimes you may feel that, okay, why
am these guys are not helping me a lot?

200
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,680
Because they have so many other
things to take care because

201
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,000
they're working for the bank.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,959
The bank will have so much of protocols
they to follow each and every protocol.

203
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,430
Then only they can be secure.

204
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,139
With the help of aa, like routine
banking transactions, like the tele

205
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,640
transactions, the other customer
questions either you can go, we can

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,490
send it to aa, like chat bots or agents.

207
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,600
The other way around you can directly
go to the kiosk or directly talk to

208
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,700
the kind of robo, which I'm expecting.

209
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,110
You may see be 20%.

210
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:43,070
For example, like Wells Fargo is
actively working with the future.

211
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:47,045
Implementing advanced automated
systems to manage routine transactions.

212
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:49,535
Freeing the financial advice,
like if you want to go for the

213
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,815
bank, for the loan process, okay.

214
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:55,955
It should take so much of paperwork,
the initial discussion, everything.

215
00:12:55,955 --> 00:13:00,365
Now the advisor, not only to what you
approve the time he or she can spend

216
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:04,120
so much of time with you currently,
or personal finance planning, and.

217
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:06,395
Customer needs, complex customer needs.

218
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:08,135
The complex customer should be anyone.

219
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:12,545
If you're trying to do something different
and you want to understand about how the

220
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:15,900
bank is working on everything, maybe you
might not get the information right now

221
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,550
with the A, with the bots and everything,
but you can get the same information

222
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,930
with the from the in human, which they're
able to focus only on those things.

223
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:28,979
That is a groundbreaking and
changing for the banking sector,

224
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,530
which we may see by 2027.

225
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,110
That's one thing I'm pretty
much looking forward.

226
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:37,945
And not only Wells Fargo, which I'm
thinking about the Bank of America,

227
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:42,425
chase, our key bank, or what are the
bank, you name it, across worldwide.

228
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:48,155
We have almost more than a hundred
thousand plus banks, which I am

229
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:52,165
giving you some pretty much gold
some information of contract banks.

230
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:57,385
But where we have one 90 plus countries,
each country will have different banks

231
00:13:57,385 --> 00:14:01,195
and the common bank, private bank, whoever
they need to follow the guidelines of.

232
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Cary Rules, bank Rules, and with
that all the financial advisor will

233
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,140
have so much of button on them.

234
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,460
So if you're able to automate the routine
task so that they can concentrate mainly

235
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,620
on this advising the end user customers
like you and me will go to the bank.

236
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,740
We'll get all the information, or
if you call them Financial Advisor,

237
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,070
you can take the card, they can
provide you all the information.

238
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,980
Pretty much I'm looking
forward to see, going to help.

239
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,165
Exactly.

240
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,225
And then the same thing
about the risk models.

241
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:36,685
The risk models issued extraordinary
accuracy, which so many of lms

242
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,328
are going to see in future.

243
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:43,608
Right now we are pretty less, this means
still companies are working on the lms.

244
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:48,018
With that, we can get 97% of
enabling fair lending practices.

245
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:52,278
For example, FinTech companies like
Aman Square use advanced models to

246
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,508
accurately assess clear risk, offering
equitable financial products to

247
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,758
historically deserved populations.

248
00:14:59,208 --> 00:14:59,538
See this?

249
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,753
So what are the transactions?

250
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:03,648
What are the take an exam?

251
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:07,488
If I'm going to apply for the
loan, okay, I need to fill

252
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,348
all recommendation by default.

253
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,038
Our banks are tied with
the Affirm are square.

254
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,368
They'll pull all the information off
you and they'll send us to the bank

255
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:22,158
so that bank can do the, all the ities
and everything with the A immediately.

256
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:27,088
Right now all Affirm are Square is
leveraging the advanced AI models so

257
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:30,688
that once they get the information,
they're doing all the checks right

258
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:34,408
away so that the banks are able to
spend pretty less time on this, in

259
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,748
this, on this application, everything.

260
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,118
The ation making will be much faster.

261
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,918
With this, we can find anomalies or
something or someone is trying to do

262
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:48,268
some bad things or anything with AI
can pretty much easily so that the

263
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:52,678
bankers cannot approve the loan or the
persons who are in the pretty genuine

264
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:58,418
information so that they can get the
loans pretty much easy and even we need

265
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:02,228
to talk about the, a social benefits
as well, how it is going to help

266
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,928
the V and operational enhancements.

267
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:10,433
YAYA driven initiatives have actionable
banking service to 1.7 billion

268
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,683
previously unbanked users globally.

269
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:18,953
Mobile payment platform like AM and Kenya,
which is a one of the country in Africa.

270
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:23,493
Maybe some part, maybe still into the
old traditional ways there to go with

271
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,593
the advanced technology, but still come.

272
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:29,283
Some banks are coming back and saying
that, okay, we are going to leverage

273
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:34,473
ai, which helped them pouring millions
with secure and can banking services.

274
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:37,233
Okay.

275
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,613
What about the community impact?

276
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:43,273
So this is one of my sector where we can
see the community, how it's going to help.

277
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:49,243
The AI has strengthened consumer
protection with advanced fraud detection

278
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:54,263
systems preventing approximately
15.4 billion in consumer financial

279
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,473
losses, like pay for instance, and
plus AI ActionAlly to in a time

280
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:04,063
safeguarding millions of ways in ware
from sophisticated digital threats.

281
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:07,363
If you're talking about the global
financial inclusion where we are

282
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:12,013
talking about the Kenya Bank, which
they're going to leverage a enable

283
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:16,873
financial access and pouring with
secure banking services, so we know

284
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:20,803
about so many people in the operating
don't about the banking and everything.

285
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,763
With this, they can understand
easily how AI going to help

286
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,323
them in their own language.

287
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:30,088
In their own understable language
so that they can go through each

288
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:33,988
and everything in the, and they
can listen and they can take ation

289
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:36,658
instead of going for the middle mass.

290
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,128
And the middleman can
simply take everything.

291
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:43,058
And if they left okay, that they can
simply, whatever they have, the mobile

292
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:47,438
or anything, they can go to the bank
and with all these things with the air.

293
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,558
And one more thing about
the small business medium

294
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:51,578
and business entrepreneurs.

295
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,203
How it's going to help the
small and medium business?

296
00:17:54,263 --> 00:18:00,503
Business success is right now we are
seeing with the a enhancement, we are

297
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:02,678
seeing 40% of increase loan approval.

298
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:08,543
Enhancements, like companies like Kaba
or Fund Box utilize a efficiently SME

299
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:12,953
credit witness supporting academic
growth and innovation in our understand

300
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,293
communities, undeserved communities.

301
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:16,763
Okay.

302
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:17,813
That's the thing.

303
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,973
Finally how it is going to
implement effective aid deployment

304
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:27,353
in must s planning clearly find
objectives, measurable outcomes,

305
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,823
and comprehensive talent and skill.

306
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:33,893
Government, robust governance and
ethical guide in due responsible use,

307
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,983
continuous monitoring and adaptive
improvements aligned with evolving

308
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:41,973
regulated frameworks all the time we are
talking about how we can improve the ai.

309
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,853
At the same time, we need to
think about how statistically

310
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:46,023
it's going to be planned.

311
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:51,003
Clearly identified objects,
measurable outcomes, and comprehensive

312
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:52,263
talent and skill development.

313
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:57,483
These are the things we need to think
about is AI improvement, robust governance

314
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:00,783
and ethical guidance in general,
responsible use, continuous monitoring,

315
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:05,613
for sure, how you monitor the all the
services in the cloud infrastructure the

316
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:11,853
same way we should have wanting about
the A and implement evolving frameworks.

317
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,303
Finally, in conclusion,
what I want to say is.

318
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:19,383
Strategic a deployment is
fundamentally transforming financial

319
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:25,099
services, delivering measurable,
ROI miserable, ROI and RI.

320
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:29,643
Enhancing human roles and positively
impacting communities globally.

321
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:34,053
A, the parents a unique opportunity,
not mely as a technical advancement,

322
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,558
but as a powerful tool of creating a
fair, more inclusive financial level.

323
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:43,518
And what if you see the compliance
automation, a motor religion is across

324
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:48,198
justification, complaints, documentation,
generation, audit, ation, this scanning,

325
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,788
if you see about documentation, we to
spend so much of time previously to

326
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:57,583
create a document the meaningful way with
the help of a in less than our, I don't

327
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,303
know, not an hour, less than 10 minutes.

328
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:03,228
We are able to create a document,
which is helping everyone.

329
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:04,188
Okay.

330
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,858
I'm one of the example where I'm going
to, I'm using it right now with the

331
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:13,178
a. Previously I need to spend hours
and hours on the documentation to

332
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,768
put everything in a proper order.

333
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,078
Now I'm ING synopsis and everything.

334
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:22,448
What I want to create a document, the A,
is helping me to create a document so that

335
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:26,708
I don't need to spend hours and hours,
like every day, like two, three hours.

336
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,788
I need to spend a documentation.

337
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,758
No, I'm spending less
than hour or maybe less.

338
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:36,158
And that's the way how the document
generation has changed over period of last

339
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:39,008
two years with the AI audit practitioner.

340
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,498
Previously for the audit, we used
to spend so much of time to putting

341
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:48,008
all the documents in one place
and go to each every document.

342
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:52,518
And the boring and worrying and
all the time, okay, yeah, sorry.

343
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,988
We need to document instead of that.

344
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:57,858
Now with this ai, those
activities much more.

345
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:02,363
Easier and I can spend much more
time on how I can improve the other

346
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:05,183
financial systems, how I can help the
other stakeholders and everything.

347
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:07,283
I can spend some more time
there instead of sending the,

348
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,023
doing the routine activities.

349
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:10,203
Yep.

350
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,383
Finally, the key measurable impact.

351
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:17,793
How is going, how ROI, how is the
a going to implement ROI across

352
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:18,993
multiple financial domains?

353
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:22,243
S implementation, how,
implementation strategy.

354
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:23,683
Define clear optics.

355
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,853
Envision talent.

356
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:25,993
Okay.

357
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,003
How I going to envision the talent?

358
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:31,063
Like enhancing the human growth
and points impact in community.

359
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,533
And then stablish governance.

360
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,238
Measure RI continuously.

361
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:34,958
Other.

362
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,598
We need to measure the how.

363
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:39,928
What is the R way with the
A. That will help a lot.

364
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:43,408
These are the key takeaways,
which I always benefit.

365
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,383
Measurable impact, strategy,
implementation, human, a

366
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:48,093
partnership and community benefit.

367
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:54,963
A implementation, RIA success request
through all the global planning come

368
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:59,463
from combining a capital expertise,
a transformation beyond ROI to

369
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,873
create a broader social impact.

370
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,213
Finally, thank you.

371
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,973
Thank you for joining this
con particular session.

372
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:09,663
Let's continue Leveraging yes,
transformative power to shape

373
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:13,863
a brighter, more equitable
financial future for everyone.

374
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:18,618
This is what I want to discuss with
you all about this AI implementation

375
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:20,518
with respect to the financial world.

376
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:22,198
Hope this helps everyone.
