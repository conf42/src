00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,029
Hi, my name is PaweÅ‚.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,940
For a quick background, I used to be
a Java developer and then I gradually

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,109
moved to the dark side and currently
I'm taking care of several teams of

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,890
DevOps and developers at Xebia Poland.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,319
Today I would like to present
you a topic of imposter syndrome.

6
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,359
Let's start with a quick background.

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:20,889
What is impostor syndrome?

8
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,479
What is not an impostor syndrome?

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,549
Who should be concerned?

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,099
What is the science around this?

11
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,149
We'll then look into the mind
of a person with impostor

12
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,879
syndrome and see how they think.

13
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,409
We'll explore some risks, what
things can go wrong and what dark

14
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,019
places you can find yourself.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,239
We'll look at some mechanisms.

16
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,169
The understanding of mechanisms
by itself is a little bit helpful.

17
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:47,954
But we will also look at some
particular solutions, tips, and

18
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:52,661
tricks on how to do, how to deal
with the imposter syndrome, right?

19
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,791
start with the background.

20
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:55,801
what is an imposter syndrome?

21
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,661
What is not?

22
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,871
Should we be concerned?

23
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,521
And what is the science there?

24
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:04,691
basically, imposter syndrome is a
kind of like psychological pattern

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,711
or mild personality dysfunction,
where a person doubts their skills,

26
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,831
abilities, intelligence to do the job.

27
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:11,891
Okay.

28
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:15,601
person doesn't believe should
be the place where they are.

29
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:19,531
For instance, if they are some
senior developers, they don't

30
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,891
believe they should be senior.

31
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:24,381
If they were hired in some company,
they don't believe that it should be

32
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:29,391
hired, despite some obvious external
evidence of their competence, right?

33
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:34,256
And there is also this constant fear
that somebody at some point will

34
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:38,216
find out that we are impostors and
then the terrible things will happen.

35
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:43,996
We'll be fired, we'll be demoted,
our wife, Lisa, or the dogs will

36
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:47,076
walk away, the fishes will swim
away or something like this.

37
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:50,766
so there is this constant and
long lasting feeling that may

38
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,706
take several months, even years.

39
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:57,186
So the science behind this, there
was a paper in the late 70s by

40
00:01:57,236 --> 00:02:01,936
Pauline Clance and Susan Eames,
and they were researching, say, the

41
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,946
environment of high achieving women.

42
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:08,206
So women in academia, with titles
of professors, doctors, with lots

43
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:14,046
of research papers, and also in
business, directors, CEOs, etc.

44
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:18,446
And there was this, there was this
recurring feeling that they don't

45
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:22,856
belong there, they are not good enough,
and also somebody at some point will

46
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,226
find out that they are impostors.

47
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:28,496
Initially it was thought that it's
mostly about women, but then later

48
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:32,796
research proved that impostor syndrome
works on both genders, in fact.

49
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,726
who should be concerned?

50
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:39,776
Surprisingly, all of us, so depending
on the research you look at, there is

51
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:45,576
between 50 or 80 or even 90 percent of
people who are experiencing impostor

52
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,826
syndrome at some point of their lives.

53
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,456
It might happen at many points.

54
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:52,346
For instance, if you are starting the
career, you're a junior developer,

55
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:57,346
you think that I shouldn't be hired
in the first place, but There are

56
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:00,786
different expectations between
junior and senior, of course.

57
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:04,626
And if you are junior, you still
might have this experience of five

58
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,836
years of computer science study, etc.

59
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,816
Somebody decided to
recruit you to the company.

60
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:13,016
All right, it might happen when
you're switching the careers.

61
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:17,296
So if you used to be a developer, you're
moving to management, or used to be

62
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:21,576
QA, or the development, or architect,
or whatever else, and direction.

63
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:25,806
If something is changing, there's a high
risk of getting an imposter syndrome,

64
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:30,386
and also especially for people that
are somewhere really high, right?

65
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,846
You have a lot of achievements,
you are maybe a famous actor, some

66
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:37,726
kind of celebrity, you're somebody
at the top of the company, and it's

67
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,806
quite possible that the imposter
syndrome will be the strongest here.

68
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,866
That is connected with
intelligence, right?

69
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,506
So intelligent people have this
tendency to overthink some problems.

70
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:51,316
and overprepare for issues
that are not really there.

71
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:55,616
It's connected with perfectionism,
so if you want to, if you want to

72
00:03:55,616 --> 00:04:00,076
have things done perfectly or not
at all, that might be a problem.

73
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,816
It's connected, speaking of the big
five of personality traits, there is

74
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:08,396
this neuroticism trait that if you
have high, if you are highly neurotic,

75
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:14,046
basically you feel like, feel a lot of
fear, strong emotions, stuff like this,

76
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,546
you're not very emotionally stable, and
this is also something that is Makes

77
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:24,156
you prone to feel like an imposter
and experience this fear, right?

78
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,166
It's not imposter syndrome.

79
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:30,156
So it's not about imposter
syndrome if you're an actual fraud.

80
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:33,881
So if you say on purpose Not you
can do something, but you can't.

81
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:39,081
Trying to, trying to make somebody believe
that you are good, but you are not.

82
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:45,371
not about momentary doubt, because
all of us have those doubts, right?

83
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,351
At some point, at some moment, we
might feel that we are not good enough.

84
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,931
I had a bad day or even a week, but
impostor syndrome is about having

85
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,241
this issue for months or even years.

86
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,661
It's not about, it's not
really a mental illness per se.

87
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:03,581
There is no international code
of diseases code for that.

88
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:07,931
Although I've read some research in a
British paper where they are considering

89
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,771
making it an official mental illness.

90
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:12,711
It's not about humbleness per se.

91
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:17,951
humbleness is a nice trait, but if
it stops you from, doing some nice

92
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,521
stuff and exploring the company
and the world, that's a problem.

93
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,081
And as I mentioned, it's not
really specific to women, right?

94
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:29,250
It was initially thought that
it's about women, but it turns out

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,101
that both genders are affected.

96
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,301
Maybe women a little bit more.

97
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,571
It also works for, I think
all minorities, right?

98
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:41,341
Because if you are in, any kind of
minority you might feel stronger needs

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:46,756
to prove yourself and there might
be an additional doubt and it makes

100
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,256
you prone to the imposter syndrome.

101
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:53,046
So if you google top 10 celebrities with
imposter syndrome you'll probably find a

102
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:58,736
lot of quotes like this, that seems that
I'm somewhere by mistake and every time

103
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:04,903
I appear there I have to prove that I'm
actually good or maybe no matter at what

104
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:07,266
point of your career you as you arrive.

105
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,606
You still wonder how did you get there?

106
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:13,066
And you are being afraid
of being discovered, right?

107
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:16,676
There's this recurring theme
of being discovered as a fraud

108
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,066
and then losing everything.

109
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:23,176
And there is this feeling of
inadequacy and again this theme of

110
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:28,596
somebody will find out that I'm a
fraud and everything will be lost.

111
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:33,806
Okay, so now let's look into the mind
of a person with impostor syndrome.

112
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:35,006
So what's the thinking there?

113
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:41,906
So whenever we have some success due to
our skills or abilities, we will actually

114
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,176
attribute this to one of two things.

115
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:47,246
One of those things are
seven factors in general.

116
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:50,996
So I was able to do something
because I was lucky, right?

117
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:53,896
There were some unfavorable circumstances.

118
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,696
So for instance, I was the only
person in the recruitment process,

119
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,006
so they had to hire me, of course.

120
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:06,706
Maybe I was able to deceive the recruiter
that in fact, I'm better than I really am.

121
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:10,321
All right, maybe there was some
misjudgment on their part, so maybe

122
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:14,941
there was, Maybe I was speaking with
an engineering manager who is not a

123
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:18,711
technical person, so he was not able
to really judge my technical skills.

124
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:22,516
He just thought that, hey, I'm a
nice person, maybe I should be hired.

125
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:24,676
Maybe it's about connections, right?

126
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:27,746
I was able to get a job or do
something because of my connections.

127
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:32,366
And here, disclaimer, connections
are not something really bad, right?

128
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,416
It's a part of your life.

129
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:39,496
So network is a part of, it's your assets,
like a skill or ability or experience.

130
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:42,516
So don't be afraid to use
your connections as an asset.

131
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:46,086
Of course, I'm not talking about,
some pathological situations

132
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:50,971
like in politics, probably, but
just healthy use of your network.

133
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,091
But there's one possibility.

134
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:56,331
I was successful because
of external factors, okay?

135
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,611
The other possibility is overwork.

136
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:02,941
So I was successful because I
put additional hours, like I

137
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,621
was doing countless reviews.

138
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:09,671
I was doing the overwork and without
even logging this in a company system,

139
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:13,841
because it would, I would be discovered
that I'm a fraud because I should

140
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,541
be able to do this faster, right?

141
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,171
Not spend that much time.

142
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:21,731
So either external factors or
overwork, that's our thinking.

143
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:25,631
We should also note that all of
us have this kind of a belief

144
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,401
filter, belief system in our head.

145
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:31,881
So because the world is complicated
place, we do some simplification,

146
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:36,671
some explanation how things work,
some categories, we put people,

147
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,251
things in some categories, right?

148
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:43,761
This belief system forms up until
you're 20, more or less 20 years

149
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:48,581
old, 2025, and later it's a little
bit difficult to change that.

150
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:53,861
If you are getting some information that's
contradicting your belief system, you will

151
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:58,871
try to, if it's not fitting very well, I
can try to bend it a little bit to fit.

152
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:03,441
But if it's trying to contradict your
system, I might just, plainly discard

153
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,731
the feedback of the information.

154
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,146
So it will be important
a little bit later.

155
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:11,676
Now, 0s and 1s, we are in
computer science, so 0s and

156
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,796
1s seems to be a nice thing.

157
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:18,196
But at the end, I'm thinking about
this perfectionism here again, right?

158
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,946
So if you're a perfectionist,
Everything is either zero,

159
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,676
total trash, or one perfect.

160
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:28,526
And we know there's no 23 perfect,
so even if it's zero, it's 90,

161
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,036
98 percent, 99 percent, anything.

162
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,286
We just run this down to
zero, and it's trash for you.

163
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:39,216
This is a problem with impostor syndrome,
because you might think that almost

164
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:42,956
everything that you do is actually
trash, where in fact it's almost perfect.

165
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:47,396
how does stone translate to
IT, or to technical work, or

166
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,636
knowledge work in general?

167
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:53,351
So in general, we have Mostly
smart people in 19, or at

168
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,551
least we choose to believe so.

169
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,251
So it's about this intelligence
that I mentioned earlier.

170
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:01,281
If you're intelligent, you're
thinking about a lot of

171
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,391
problems, sometimes overthinking.

172
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,491
It might not be very good.

173
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,101
Our industry is intangible.

174
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:08,096
What does it mean?

175
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:11,646
So it's difficult to judge the
quality of what we do, right?

176
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:15,746
if you look at some counter examples
from classical craftsmanship,

177
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:19,906
for instance, let's take medieval
blacksmith with his forging swords.

178
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,086
You can take the sword
into your hand, right?

179
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:26,146
You can check if it's balanced, you
can check if it has some sharp edge.

180
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:30,756
You can see if it has some nice
ornaments, if it looks good.

181
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,956
If you think about baker or painter
or anything like this, it's similar.

182
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:38,046
We are used to judging
this type of quality.

183
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:42,996
But in IT, what we do is
sometimes magical for people.

184
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,766
from outside our field, right?

185
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:50,096
So it's, for instance, let's do an
experiment and let's try to, describe to

186
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:55,986
your grandmother that you prepared a nice
suite of automated tests or your method

187
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:59,736
has a low cyclomatic complexity, right?

188
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:00,846
It's difficult.

189
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:06,756
And whenever it is difficult to explain
what we do, it's an area where there's

190
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:11,616
a lot of doubt and the feeling of being
an imposter might be magnified here.

191
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:18,168
Maybe it's a little easier on the, say,
front end or design side, if you are

192
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,973
creating some UIs or websites, etc.

193
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:24,786
You can look at the website and say, okay,
it has some nice animations, buttons, etc.

194
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:29,711
But it's more difficult on this,
maybe more back end or obscure side.

195
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,056
areas of what we do.

196
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:35,056
Also our industry is growing rapidly.

197
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:42,286
So uncle Bob around I believe eight or
nine years ago mentioned that on average

198
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:47,346
the median age of median experience
of a software developer is five years.

199
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:51,416
So half of the developers have
less than five years of experience.

200
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,986
There is a great influence
of people into the industry.

201
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,896
Those people are creating a lot
of things, that other people use.

202
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:01,406
So we have new version of
languages, libraries, new

203
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,066
framework, new methodologies.

204
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:08,096
We can do a lot of things in, let's
say, different layers of abstraction

205
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:11,146
or software and deconstruction
of our software and systems.

206
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:16,496
And it makes you think that after
a few years there is so much Things

207
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:21,536
going on, so much technology, so much
knowledge and skills, and you should be

208
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:25,986
learning all of that, but in fact, it's
impossible, it's just too much, just a

209
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,966
smart portion of it, and it's normal.

210
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:32,796
And then we have this, let's say,
approve, make it till you make it,

211
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:37,726
so we're hearing about some companies
that are curing cancer in the garage,

212
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:40,451
or fixing the problem of, of cancer.

213
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:42,351
shortage in Africa, right?

214
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:46,151
And it might be overwhelming, so
everything on the social media should be,

215
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,921
should be consumed with a grain of salt.

216
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,581
All right, let's move on to risks.

217
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:57,161
What can basically go wrong
with imposter syndrome on dark

218
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,721
places you can visit as a result?

219
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:03,651
first of all, when you have this constant
fear that somebody will discover that

220
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:08,551
you're an imposter, you have to have
this constant process of defense, right?

221
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:12,081
you have to check who is in the
room, what you can say, what is safe,

222
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:16,521
and basically consumes your energy,
because it's like this process running

223
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:20,216
in your head, consuming your mental
energy, willpower, if you will,

224
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,561
and if you compare to computer, the
cyclist of your processor, right?

225
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,161
it makes you exhausted
at the end of the day.

226
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:30,216
If you are afraid that something bad
will happen, you will be discovered,

227
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,486
it might lead to some anxiety states.

228
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,846
There is the whole topic of
burnout, 12 stages of burnout, a

229
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,266
lot of presentation, a long topic.

230
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:43,426
But in the end, it can lead to some
really nasty places, mental problems,

231
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,156
such as depression and similar.

232
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:50,465
Furthermore, there's a problem, there
might be a problem with balance, right?

233
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:56,125
If you choose this path of overwork,
then you can sacrifice your private life.

234
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,675
You might have an issue with
relationship, because if you don't want

235
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:03,605
to be discovered as fraud, then you
will naturally avoid people, either

236
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,685
at work or, but also private things.

237
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:07,505
keep people at distance.

238
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,685
There's the thing with procrastination,
so basically you might want to

239
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:15,605
avoid situation where you will
be tested, when somebody can

240
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,145
find out that you're an imposter.

241
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:22,185
And this in terms might lead to issue
of priorities, so imagine you have a

242
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:26,055
sprint, there are some important tasks
and less important tasks, or maybe

243
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,755
easier and harder tasks, so you might
want to focus on the stuff that you are

244
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,965
comfortable with, not the stuff that
really matter, and in the end it might

245
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,745
actually lead to failing the sprint.

246
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:39,675
And changes, people with impostor
syndrome might be not really afraid

247
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:43,232
of changes because that's a moment
of test where somebody might find out

248
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:48,705
that they are impostors or perceived
impostors, so they might want to, might,

249
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:53,895
avoid looking for a new job or maybe
changing a project within your current

250
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,125
organization and miss many opportunities.

251
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,735
What else can be missed?

252
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,770
All right, so knowledge, basically
in order to learn skills and

253
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,040
develop, you have to get out of
your comfort zone just a little bit.

254
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,370
So if you're afraid of being
discovered, you just naturally

255
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,620
stick to things that you know well.

256
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:15,740
You might, miss some occasions
for promotion in the company,

257
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,040
maybe some pay raise.

258
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:23,545
And also, the company, the team, the
whole IT industry misses the ideas

259
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:27,965
and knowledge that you have been
providing, because you are afraid to

260
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:32,535
speak up, or afraid that, what you say
is stupid or something like this, right?

261
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:37,475
Let's look at some mechanisms,
like psychological patterns

262
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,435
and stuff around that.

263
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,375
And knowledge about this
is helpful by itself.

264
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,315
As we will also get to some
concrete tips later on.

265
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:49,865
So first of all, the sheer
realization that there is something

266
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,655
like an impostor syndrome, right?

267
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:54,505
It's not that there is something
wrong with me, it's just a

268
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,595
psychological thing, impostor syndrome.

269
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,895
This is the first thing that
if you realize that you might

270
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,085
be in a much better place.

271
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,290
The second thing is, This is very common.

272
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,470
It's not like it's one
or two percent of people.

273
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,390
It's basically half of us
probably watching this.

274
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,530
And also it's probably
to some extent solvable.

275
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,880
Whether it's fully solvable or not,
that's slightly philosophical questions.

276
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,970
It's can you get rid of all
your demos and stuff like this.

277
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:27,575
It's hard to say, but you can for sure,
diminish the effects of that, and you

278
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:31,675
can learn how to deal with that, for
instance, how to drink tea with your

279
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:34,425
demons and live with them, right?

280
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:39,385
In order not to be too softish in this
talk, I have some diagram for you.

281
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:45,045
So this is the central mechanism in
imposter syndrome, the imposter cycle.

282
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,675
We're running in some kind of
cycles, and how does it look?

283
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,460
So we start with tasks.

284
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,630
Starting with task, we approach this,
we have some anxiety, we have some worry

285
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,370
about this, can we make it this time?

286
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,930
Maybe they will discover this time that
I'm an imposter, but at some point we

287
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,880
have to make a choice and do something.

288
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,660
So we have two paths to choose here.

289
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:12,540
We can either go with over preparation,
so it's additional time, over work,

290
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,950
the time that I'm not even logging
in the system, I will make countless,

291
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,090
reviews, countless fixes, etc.

292
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,010
I get a lot of knowledge.

293
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,710
put additional effort, or maybe I
can go the procrastination route.

294
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,990
So I assume that, okay,
there's nothing to be done.

295
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,940
They will just discover
that I'm an imposter, right?

296
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,900
Or on the other hand, maybe I will
be lucky this time, but I just

297
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,540
want to postpone this, pressure
and feeling that I will be tested.

298
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,010
So it reminds me the situation on the
university when I was studying that

299
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,340
there is an exam in half an hour or
something like this, and at some point I

300
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,230
just decide I'm cramming from the book.

301
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,305
front of the room.

302
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:54,025
At some point, I just decide to close
the book, put it away, get up, get

303
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,775
some walk, get some fresh air, etc.

304
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,435
I just, I don't want to think
about this, and this is like

305
00:17:58,435 --> 00:17:59,785
a procrastination mechanism.

306
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:06,115
whichever path we choose in the end, since
we are competent and intelligent, etc.

307
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,355
we are able to succeed
in this task, right?

308
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,905
So we have this accomplishment, we have
the relief that okay, maybe this time

309
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:15,235
I was able to somehow slip by, right?

310
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:20,275
So I got the positive feedback and here
is the time when this filter kicks in

311
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:24,355
our head that hey, We are not really
good, we are not intelligent, so whatever

312
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,045
they are saying they are just nicer.

313
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:31,365
Whatever doesn't fit my belief system,
so I discard it or ban it, because I

314
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,005
have an explanation on what happened.

315
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:36,465
It was either the extra effort, I
put additional hours, and this is

316
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:40,355
the reason why I succeeded, somebody
else would be able to do this in a

317
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:45,445
much shorter time, or it was just a
luck, so I was able to succeed because

318
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:49,735
of some favorable circumstances,
because I didn't put that much effort.

319
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,965
All right, so I'm not really In my
head there is this image that I'm

320
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:58,735
not really this, smart, intelligent,
capable person, but there are some

321
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:02,355
other explanations, some external
factors, extra effort and luck.

322
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,615
So let's continue all
this positive feedback.

323
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:10,485
Now my perception of being an imposter
kind of increases with each cycle,

324
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:14,315
and then we arrive on another task,
and the cycle repeats, basically.

325
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,385
Another interesting bias in our
thinking is the perception of knowledge.

326
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:23,605
So we have those mechanisms to
simplify the world, so we have

327
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,745
this in our categories for people.

328
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,970
You might have the category
of general developer, general

329
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,900
manager, general QA, etc.

330
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,720
And you assume that
they are mostly similar.

331
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,680
So what happens is that if we talk to one
person, say developer one, get a piece

332
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,270
of information A, to another developer,
another piece of information, third

333
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,050
developer, the third piece of information.

334
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,420
In our head what happens is that
all those developers merge into this

335
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,010
one developer, generic developer,
who knows all of those things.

336
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,990
So each of those developers knows all
those things and we might think that

337
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,520
A general developer knows really a
lot when we don't, and this is this

338
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,960
left picture, but the right is, the
reality is that the knowledge of

339
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,650
various people might be similar in
size to ours in the right picture.

340
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,180
Another interesting effect
is the Dunning Kruger effect.

341
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,050
there's basically a, it's a relationship
between confidence and competence.

342
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,110
whenever we gain some competence,
in some, say, new skill or some

343
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,950
new path, They're quite quickly, we
are getting out of confidence and

344
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,060
disclaimer, people are not very good at,
differentiating confidence and competence.

345
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,430
If somebody's speaking with
competence, you assume that the

346
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,760
person is of confidence, we assume
that the person is competent as well.

347
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,030
What happens is, when we learn a new
skill, something starts working, we

348
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:53,310
can produce a green path, some early
successes, and our confidence shoots

349
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,650
up, we are reaching the speed of Mount
Stupid where we think that we are

350
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,740
really good, but then we notice that,
okay, we made some mistakes, maybe we

351
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,000
changed some projects, had some fuck
ups, realized how broad the field really

352
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,460
is, and we are falling quite quickly
from this peak of monstipity into the

353
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,550
valley of despair, and our confidence
is, let's say, decreasing quite rapidly.

354
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,760
And now in order to regain this
confidence, it takes time, a lot of

355
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,470
experience, and with years of experience
we are regaining our confidence, as we

356
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,565
are reaching this level of sustainability.

357
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:32,435
Okay, and how is this
relevant to imposter syndrome?

358
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:37,125
Basically, somebody's You know, it
is value of despair or climbing the

359
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,495
slope of enlightenment, and if you
meet a person who is on the peak

360
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:45,795
of non stupid, you assume that this
person is confident, quite competent.

361
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:46,615
It's confident.

362
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,485
If it's confident, it should be competent.

363
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:53,105
And we think that, hey, this person
has two, three times less experience

364
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,965
than us, but it's quite competent.

365
00:21:55,505 --> 00:22:00,015
maybe it's something wrong with me when
in reality, you might be in a different

366
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:04,735
places on this Kruger effect chart.

367
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,235
And so we shouldn't be
too worried about this.

368
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:11,775
From my experience for software
development, basically, Mount

369
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:15,285
Stupid is somewhere around
one, one and a half years.

370
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,485
in a career.

371
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:20,465
It's the experience from technical
recruitment but probably a

372
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,955
little bit of myself as well.

373
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:26,425
So we have this, young people who
say I have 10 out of, 9 out of

374
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:31,585
10 in Java, 9 out of 10 in SQL
depending which type you're on, etc.

375
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,365
And please recruit me, give me money, etc.

376
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:33,845
Good.

377
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:37,635
But then they realize that maybe
they are not that good after all.

378
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,705
Another interesting effect
is the spotlight effect.

379
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:43,655
So basically, think of ourselves.

380
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,015
We are much more egoistic
than we would like to admit.

381
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:51,575
Okay, so we mostly focus on ourselves,
and we think that other people focus

382
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:54,075
on us as well, which they do not.

383
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:57,825
for instance, imagine that you are
in this group photo situation, right?

384
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:02,065
You have the photo taken, you
are examining it, and what's

385
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,425
the first thing that you do?

386
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,160
Probably look at yourself, whether
your tie is straight or whether

387
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,670
you are not staying with some kind
of sauce or something like this.

388
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,800
So other people are not
really that actively looking

389
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,430
at us and at our mistakes.

390
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:18,975
And, and because of that, we shouldn't
be that afraid, to speak up, to talk

391
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:23,435
to extreme ideas, et cetera, because we
won't be judged that much as we think.

392
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,045
Another thing worth knowing
is the curse of knowledge.

393
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:30,675
small children have this feature
that they assume that everyone else

394
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,075
knows and feels the same as they do.

395
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:36,445
And we grow up from that to an extent.

396
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:37,045
Okay?

397
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:37,535
Because.

398
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:42,195
There are those classical
misunderstandings between technical people

399
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:47,405
and business people where they assume that
the other party knows the same as they do.

400
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:52,735
But also I had this experience two years
of being the Java GIF master at our

401
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:58,565
company and part of the job was looking
for people that would like to speak on our

402
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:03,865
quarterly internal conferences and it was
difficult because people were shy that's

403
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:08,935
one thing but also if They were thinking
that they have nothing to say, interesting

404
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:13,665
to say to other people, that everyone
else knows this, what they do, right?

405
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:16,875
And it's not really true, because
people have different sets of knowledge.

406
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:20,615
And if you're a senior developer,
you might have a lot of experience,

407
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:24,355
probably have a lot of experience that
you can just share with other people.

408
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:27,985
If you're a junior developer, you
might just know some library or a new

409
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:33,095
version of language that others don't
and this is also a valuable topic and

410
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:37,035
so basically whenever you think that
you don't have anything interesting to

411
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:41,035
say because other people knows that they
are out of there's a lot of people who

412
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:47,225
don't right so it's worth to try and
present stuff to other people right so

413
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:50,115
let's move to some concrete solutions

414
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,085
and tips for dealing
with impostor syndrome.

415
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:58,795
First of all, once I encountered the
thread on Twitter, the X or whatever it

416
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:04,045
is called now, basically the idea is that
there were people from computer science,

417
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:09,885
IT, but also engineering and other stuff
with a lot of years of experience in their

418
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:15,105
fields, and they were mentioning Some
seemingly basic stuff that they have to

419
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:19,365
Google or look up or check in notes or
copy from previous projects, et cetera.

420
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:24,015
So especially for junior people might
seem that if you're a Java developer,

421
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:28,025
something you might, you have to know
everything about Java and everything

422
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,555
about your framework, et cetera.

423
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,010
Or in fact, I will tell you a secret.

424
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,910
Everyone Googles stuff, basically, right?

425
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Copies from previous projects, etc.

426
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,970
My personal confession is that I used
to write in Java for, 12 or more years.

427
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,570
And currently, I don't remember how
to read a file into the memory, a

428
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,990
file from the disk into the memory.

429
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,514
I always have to Google that because
there are, nested streams, etc.

430
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:57,524
I used to know this probably 10 years
ago at some point when I was doing

431
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,164
the certification, but not anymore.

432
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,934
Alright, so Basically, don't think that
you should be, you should know everything,

433
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:06,634
everyone is googling, that's okay.

434
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,654
Shift words about comparisons.

435
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:13,984
We tend to compare ourselves to other
people, but this is not really a

436
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:17,884
good idea because you have different
materials for comparison, right?

437
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:20,894
We can compare this to
object oriented programming.

438
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:24,924
If you look at people as objects, if
you look at yourself, you have access

439
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:27,399
to your, internal variables and the
history of your state and what you

440
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:28,738
were doing, how you were feeling, etc.

441
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:31,226
But if you look at other people,
you only just see the public

442
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,374
standard they choose to show you.

443
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:33,714
After that, this is filtered by your

444
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:35,894
belief system, internal belief system.

445
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:42,689
So the only really good comparison is if
you are comparing yourself to your earlier

446
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,889
snapshots in time with yourself, right?

447
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:48,969
look at you, what have you learned in
the previous month, previous year, or

448
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:52,719
ten years, or whatever, and this is some
kind of comparison that you can use.

449
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:54,659
All others are, probably wrong.

450
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,029
All right, a little bit
about imperfections.

451
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:01,909
Japanese people have this art of
fixing broken ceramic with gold, right?

452
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:07,439
They have this notion that the ceramic,
or some object, a piece of work, or a

453
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,989
person is broken, then it makes them.

454
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,844
Unique, and they have soul
because of that, right?

455
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:18,554
So whenever you think of yourself
that your work is broken, or you

456
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,614
are broken, might just think that,
hey, you have a soul, you are

457
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:22,884
unique, that makes you unique.

458
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:24,794
And this is positive.

459
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:28,334
All right, a little bit
about computer games, right?

460
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:29,824
Achievements in computer games.

461
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:34,044
We have achievements in computer games for
a reason, because, they release a little

462
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:36,394
bit of dopamine in your bloodstream.

463
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:37,844
It makes you feel better.

464
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:41,974
whenever you're really not feeling very
well, you might think about creating a

465
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:44,454
list of achievements for yourself, right?

466
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:49,464
the list of projects that you did,
some schools you went to, studies,

467
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:52,284
books that you have read, some
courses that you finished, etc.

468
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:53,154
Stuff like this.

469
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:54,389
This might help you.

470
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,069
Kind of similar to a CV or
maybe a LinkedIn profile,

471
00:27:58,099 --> 00:27:59,299
but maybe something else.

472
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,819
And whenever you're in this, not a very
good mood, you can get back to this list

473
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,589
and see that, Hey, I achieved so much.

474
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:06,979
I'm not that bad.

475
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,959
Some people say that it works
better if it's in a physical form.

476
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:12,839
So we have all those, clouds.

477
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:17,383
But in the end, if you write it down
on a piece of paper, put it in a

478
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:20,337
drawer, it might have a little bit more
power to our analog mind, let's say.

479
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:22,109
Unless your house burns
down and your dog eats

480
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:23,309
the paper, of course.

481
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:24,949
And besides that, you're good.

482
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:29,139
Again, about social media, if you
see anything on social media, any

483
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:33,059
successes, etc., I should keep in
mind that everything is filtered,

484
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:37,729
everything was chosen to be there,
and also it's going through your

485
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,859
belief, internal belief filters, so you
should take it with a grain of salt.

486
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,759
About job ads, so yeah, we have the space
unicorns, you can say, sometimes we can

487
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:52,709
see a list of requirements, very long
list of requirements of various stuff

488
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,289
on the job ads, but you should be aware
that those are mostly wish lists, right?

489
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:02,789
The employer doesn't require you to know
all of that, maybe just some of that.

490
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,489
There's a piece of trivia about
the IBM in, I believe, late 70s.

491
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:12,289
There was a research, how people respond
to internal job ads for internal projects.

492
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:16,919
Turned out that men were applying
when they met about 60 percent

493
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:21,319
of criteria, but women usually
had to met around 90 percent.

494
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,414
So ladies were maybe not that
competent, at least not confident,

495
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:27,574
I'm sorry, at least at this time.

496
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:33,414
All right, so our brains, reptile brain,
I have to be aware that, our brains

497
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:38,914
have these layers that were created
in a, during the process of evolution

498
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:40,574
over hundreds of millions of years.

499
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:44,714
We have this primitive parts that
basically take care of, basic,

500
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:48,994
our basic instincts, survival
instincts and reacting to threats.

501
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:50,214
So whenever you're.

502
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:55,244
Say coding or doing some difficult
mental work and you find yourself

503
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:58,184
at this position that you're
stuck You don't know what to do.

504
00:29:58,194 --> 00:29:59,754
You don't understand how something works.

505
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:01,274
Start to worry.

506
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,464
I'm not that good.

507
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:09,694
They will fire me Terrible start to
feel this fear and whenever the fear

508
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:14,654
sets in basically cuts off your let's
say the new part of the brain, the

509
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:18,664
new cortex that does all the thinking
and programming and stuff and leaves

510
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:23,124
everything to this primitive part
that deals with threats and security.

511
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:29,424
So whenever you think that you're afraid
and you think that, my god, I'm stupid,

512
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:31,334
you're basically making yourself stupid.

513
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:35,474
blood flow to the neocortex is
reduced, and this is the self

514
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:36,984
fulfilling prophecy, basically.

515
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:41,674
So whenever you find yourself in this
situation, it's better to break away from

516
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:47,554
this thought, just get up, get a walk, get
something to drink, talk to somebody, etc.

517
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:52,474
Just try to detect this pattern and not
succumb to all those dark thoughts there.

518
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:58,559
A little bit about talent, so is there
Does something like a talent exist or not?

519
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:05,189
So Edison has this famous quote
that 99 percent of success is hard

520
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,859
work, just 1 percent is talent.

521
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,559
In general, people who are successful
usually just are persistent, so they

522
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,389
are trying some things in a different
way many times to make it work.

523
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,309
And in order to do that, you probably
have to like it just a little

524
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,249
bit, to experiment many times.

525
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:27,279
Basically, my advice is to look
around in the company, the industry,

526
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:29,499
because our industry is quite broad.

527
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,039
You can do a lot of things, really.

528
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:37,269
You can be developer, QA, architect,
DevOps, you can be some agile role, some

529
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,729
scrum role, maybe some management, etc.

530
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:43,999
There's really a lot of things to do,
and you shouldn't be measuring the

531
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,449
developers, just by the number of lines
of code or something like this, right?

532
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:52,904
Even if you want to just keep the
label of developer, You can be a

533
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,664
developer and do a lot of things.

534
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:56,344
You can have some attitude.

535
00:31:56,844 --> 00:32:00,384
You can be better at talking to
people, organizing something.

536
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:02,734
Maybe you're more on the DevOps stuff.

537
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:06,184
Maybe you are just this person,
like a good spirit of the team

538
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,424
that's removed from the projects.

539
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:14,979
Basically breaks the whole team and
you lose three people in fact, just

540
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:19,079
one person if you effectively work
with three people, something like that.

541
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:24,779
So try to look around and see what's
there and experiment and maybe

542
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,639
you will find a better niche for
yourself as well in the industry.

543
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:29,519
A little bit about recruitment.

544
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:33,039
So if you have a chance to be
taken for a recruiter, it's a.

545
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:37,989
It's a nice opportunity to see
this, see that people don't really

546
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:40,469
sometimes know the things that you do.

547
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,639
So this knowledge is different
for different people.

548
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:47,149
Of course, it's also a trap because
you might have this urge to, come up

549
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,809
with some difficult questions that
nobody will really know by heart.

550
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,419
Everybody's just looking
at the documentation.

551
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:58,049
But it's not a good idea because,
the I think recruitment is that

552
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,879
we just want to get nice people
for our company to lift your ego.

553
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,499
However, you can also get something
from yourself in the process.

554
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:06,399
just don't be nasty.

555
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,829
A little bit about remote work, right?

556
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:12,129
So a lot of us are just working.

557
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:17,164
fully remotely, even though we have
office in our town, our vicinity.

558
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:21,934
So whenever you think that maybe
you have this kind of, you feel like

559
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:27,974
imposter, and if you go to your cave
or just don't talk to people, just

560
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:31,994
work remotely all the time, it reduces
the risk of being discovered, right?

561
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:36,414
But if you want to be cured for
imposter syndrome, you have to expose

562
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,904
yourself to the stressor, actually.

563
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:41,104
So it's a nice idea if you have
possibility to sometimes, just

564
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,664
go to work, talk with people.

565
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,304
and it will help you a little bit.

566
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,524
And we are in the topic of talking.

567
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:48,514
What is this trick?

568
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:52,564
If you suspect that you're a team
leader, which is a good teammate, and

569
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:56,354
you suspect that you have some people
with heavy imposter syndrome around

570
00:33:56,354 --> 00:34:01,134
you, the next trick is to, talk to them
and be a little bit vulnerable, maybe.

571
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,914
tell something about how you
screw up at some time, you are

572
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:07,184
not feeling very secure, etc.

573
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:10,694
The idea is to just, normalize that
we are not perfect at work, right?

574
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:14,234
Sometimes we screw up and we
do not have to be perfect.

575
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,994
And maybe over time it will
just, normalize this idea.

576
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:23,164
There was a nice book by George
Brzezinski called Classicalogia.

577
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,614
It's a bit difficult to
translate to English.

578
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:30,224
It's like a science of patting on the
bottom, on the back or on the head.

579
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:36,189
Basically, it was my idea that We have
this tank of container of sweetness

580
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,349
in us, and we fill this container,
but by saying something nice or

581
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,939
having nice interactions with people.

582
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:47,459
And then we take away from this tank
when we have some difficult interactions,

583
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,099
we have to give some difficult
feedback or something like that.

584
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:56,689
And of course, The idea here is that
when the tank is empty, it's not good

585
00:34:56,689 --> 00:35:00,539
to take away from this tank because
there's nothing there and it will lead

586
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,269
to some difficult reaction probably.

587
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:08,139
So before you have some difficult
interactions in mind with a person,

588
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,299
it's good to fill this tank a little
bit, so add some positive interaction.

589
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:13,345
Help a little bit.

590
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:13,481
Appreciate.

591
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:13,891
Say something nice.

592
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:16,809
It can be something so small as
to liking a message on Teams or

593
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,959
Facebook or whatever on that person.

594
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:23,119
And last but not least,
the issue of therapy.

595
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:28,379
you maybe in Poland, there is a
little bit of social stigma that's.

596
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:34,069
Okay, I'm not crazy, I will not go to
therapies, but in States or Western

597
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,959
Europe it's much more normalized, right?

598
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,149
Most people have their shrinks.

599
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,669
don't be ashamed of asking for
help and talking to professional.

600
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,829
It's really, there's really no
shame in that, if you are feeling

601
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:48,579
overwhelmed or dealing with some issues.

602
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:52,569
A lot of companies, especially after
the COVID 19, have some programs

603
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,039
that can support you in that.

604
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,599
some free therapy hours
or something like that.

605
00:35:57,649 --> 00:36:00,769
Check, checking your company,
maybe they have something, right?

606
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,789
If you want to test yourself,
there's of course a possibility of

607
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,949
that if you google clans ip scale.

608
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:12,509
IP here starts from Impostor
Phenomenon, that's basically a 20

609
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:16,539
question test on Impostor Syndrome
with questions rated 1 to 5.

610
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,419
if you put it into Google, you'll
find a PDF with those questions.

611
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:24,709
If you don't want to calculate it
manually, you can look at psychtest.

612
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:25,809
org or some other.

613
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:29,154
Other, websites where
they have automated tests.

614
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:33,834
I did two or three such tests
after normalizing to a hundred

615
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:40,484
percent to now that I'm around 42
or 43% still impostor syndrome.

616
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:45,484
So it didn't go away fully, but I
believe at that I'm much better spot

617
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:47,194
than 10 years ago, for instance.

618
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:49,164
So it's worth to.

619
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:50,184
Work on that.

620
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:53,994
So guys, this is my, this
QR code is my LinkedIn.

621
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:55,554
So you're welcome to join.

622
00:36:56,394 --> 00:37:00,504
I also have the Twitter or Excel, whatever
you call it now, while it's still working.

623
00:37:01,444 --> 00:37:05,954
And if you prefer to read, maybe not to
look at presentations, I have a blog.

624
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:08,524
Just called how to train your java.com.

625
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:11,824
It's not really about Java
for probably a few years now.

626
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:16,409
It's more about general software and
people were, and there is an article

627
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:20,819
about impostor syndrome there as well,
probably five or six po six posts ago.

628
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:25,769
And there might be some additional links
like to this Twitter threat and maybe some

629
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:28,068
different approach to the, to the problem.

630
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:30,848
All right, so that's basically it.

631
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:36,013
So take care of yourselves and people
around you, and thank you very much.
