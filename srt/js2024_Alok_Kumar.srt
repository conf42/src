1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,780
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,720
Today, we are going to talk about how to
3dify your website using reactive fiber.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,410
So before we proceed, let
me first talk about myself.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,610
So this is Alok, your friendly
neighborhood, full stack developer.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,290
And I love JavaScript.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,480
I code, I blog, I write a box and
give talks whenever I get a chance.

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,825
So when I'm not coding, I'm mostly
watching anime or jamming to music.

8
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:29,175
Apart from that, I love cooking
and a fun fact about me that I once

9
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,365
tried to a mountain in slippers.

10
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,035
Mostly people don't believe
that when I say that.

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,785
So I always carry a proof
with me that I'm not lying.

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,855
So let's move forward.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,090
And let's talk about, what are the
things we are going to discuss today.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,400
So first we will see what are Three.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,230
js, React 3.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,110
5, WebGL, and after that, we'll start
coding, we'll set up everything.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,900
Then we'll create some 3d scenes.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,470
After that, we'll talk about
environment and staging.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,550
Then we'll talk about models.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,950
And, at the end, we'll
talk about deployment.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,690
So let's dive in.

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,030
So firstly, an introduction to Three.

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,979
js and React 3.

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,100
5.

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,780
So before that, let's
talk about what is WebGL.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,620
So WebGL is basically a JavaScript API
for rendering 2D In any web browser

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,980
and it allows, like it provides a low
level access to the GPU, which enables

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,899
us to render 3d graphics and WebGL, is
the basis of libraries like ThreeJS.

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,530
So three, as I said, ThreeJS
is, made on top of WebGL.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,030
So it abstracts the complexities
from WebGL, and it makes it

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,520
easier to use those APIs.

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,200
This includes graph, geometries,
materials, textures, lighting, and etc.

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,560
That we'll see later on.

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,870
And it works in all modern web browsers.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,020
And Pages has a good
documentation and support network.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
So let me show you some examples.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,460
So you will have a better idea
of what I'm talking about.

38
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:00,315
How threes can be used in live projects?

39
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:01,965
What are the different things we can do?

40
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:06,205
so let's first have a look at a
website that NASA has created.

41
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:12,035
So you can see here, we have one solar
system, which we can interact with.

42
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:15,305
You can zoom in and zoom out.

43
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:20,885
You can also click on, like
satellite and it'll take you to that

44
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:24,215
satellite and like more, clear view.

45
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,835
You can also interact with
the satellite from all angles.

46
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:32,385
So it is like now you have a
way to interact with the solar

47
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,525
system, which makes it, more.

48
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:41,155
Easier and also more informatic and
also a cooler way So also one more

49
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:44,805
example that I can show you which
is a very basic one that I created

50
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,904
a portfolio of mine using React 3.

51
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:47,365
5.

52
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:53,835
It's not much just a laptop, which is a
waving through and It has my resume in

53
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:58,315
it, which you can scroll down and read
also you can interact with the laptop

54
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:03,865
pretty much this much So there are
a lot of ways, so you might have

55
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,565
gotten a basic idea of what Three.

56
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,295
js is, what we can achieve through it.

57
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,995
You can use models like this laptop.

58
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:13,075
You can add interactivity like this one.

59
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:17,165
You can add animations,
lighting, all other stuff.

60
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:18,655
let's move forward.

61
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,294
So what

62
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:21,484
is React 3.

63
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,004
0 Fiber or R3F?

64
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:24,504
So basically when Three.

65
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:29,774
js started gaining popularity, So the
React ecosystem wanted to integrate

66
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,214
it, with the ease of, component
based, you can say component based.

67
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,584
So it, R3F combines that,
React's declarative syntax

68
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,279
with 3GS 3D capabilities.

69
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:42,839
It uses JSX and React
hooks to manage 3D scenes.

70
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:49,009
Now it, allows us to make a reusable
components of 3D objects and logic,

71
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,809
and the best part is that it can easily
integrate with existing React projects.

72
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:58,479
So before we, proceed to code, let
me first talk about what is Dray.

73
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,099
So Dray is a community where
people are creating help, helpers.

74
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:06,214
revolving around three years,
which they have hosted, and you

75
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:09,894
can easily just import those
helpers and use it in your project.

76
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:13,474
We'll be also using some
of those helpers today.

77
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:15,684
Let's start and set up everything.

78
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:20,044
So for that, we'll need, I'll be
creating one Vite project, and then

79
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,504
we'll integrate React 3 Fiber in that.

80
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:28,844
So to save time, I have already
started, set up one Vite project

81
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:30,324
with React configuration.

82
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:32,734
And I have installed the, packages.

83
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:37,694
So if you have a look, we have
three packages that I've installed.

84
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,504
One is native three JS that we need.

85
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,814
Another one is, react three fiber.

86
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,864
And the last one is, that
we'll be using, for help.

87
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:48,664
That's pretty much the packages we need.

88
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:52,424
rest of the folder structure is
similar as any other react project.

89
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,724
We have our, main JSX, then app.

90
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,394
jsx.

91
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,164
we'll talk about this code later on.

92
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:03,774
I've also started our server
and it is running in, port

93
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:06,384
5173 right now it's blank.

94
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,014
So there is a blank screen.

95
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:09,579
we'll start.

96
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,244
the, how the talk will go is we'll
talk about, topic then I'll show

97
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:17,154
you some code here and, live, you
can see the effects of those code.

98
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,064
So let's move forward.

99
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:23,924
So before we code, let's talk about some
of the basic components of, three DC.

100
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,254
So firstly, I've seen it, obviously.

101
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,879
So a scene is something like a stage right
where there are different objects, for

102
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,959
example actors Lighting and everything.

103
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,689
So a scene is something which will
contain objects Then we have an object

104
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:43,559
which is any object like cube or a
model Or your lighting or anything

105
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,669
then we need a camera so that we can
see that stage So camera will be our

106
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,509
point of view through which we'll be
able to see the scene and the objects

107
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,459
And at the last we need a renderer.

108
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,559
So the use of renderer is to Combine
everything and with the render it

109
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,914
with the Viewpoint of that camera.

110
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,834
So let's talk a bit in detail.

111
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:11,874
So scene is basically, as I said,
a container to contain a 3d object.

112
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:15,934
And then a 3d object can be
defined using, two things.

113
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:16,934
Firstly, a geometry.

114
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,224
So geometry is basically the
shape of that 3d object, whether

115
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,914
it is like a sphere or a cube.

116
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:25,624
And then the material is the
look and feel of that object,

117
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,594
which is like the appearance.

118
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:28,514
What is the color?

119
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,164
What is the texture of that material?

120
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:34,894
And when we combine a geometry and
a material, it will create a visible

121
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,104
3d object, which we call mess.

122
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:40,744
So let me show that with the help of an
example, so we'll have a better idea.

123
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,114
So right now here, right?

124
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:48,814
So we have one scene, for example, this
one, this whole, sky color area, right?

125
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:54,424
So this is a scene and there is a camera
placed in front of that, screen, scene.

126
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:58,664
So with that, the viewpoint of
that camera, we are just watching

127
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,104
at the front of those, this scene.

128
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:03,704
And then we have a
geometry right now here.

129
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:09,799
Which has a spare geometry and then
we'll introduce our, material to it.

130
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:15,229
So you can see we have a white color
material, which has a smooth texture,

131
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,639
which is reacting to a light source,
which is somewhere around here.

132
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:24,909
So you can see there's a light,
illuminating this area and the

133
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,839
area that is in the backside,
it is like a bit darker.

134
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,349
So this is now combining a geometry
and the material right now.

135
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,089
This ball is a object
or you can say a mess.

136
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:43,189
So this is the basic 3d, example of, what
we can achieve using these four things.

137
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,009
So let's move forward.

138
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,989
Finally, we'll start coding
and create our own 3d scenes.

139
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,669
But wait, before we write anything
in React 3, if I was, I would

140
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,199
like to show you how it would
have been done in native 3ds.

141
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,711
Basically, how to, we have done
it in like plain HTML file.

142
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:08,411
So we'll see first how, how much code
we need to create a small radius in

143
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,561
native 3js and then we'll compare
it with how much code we need to

144
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,291
actually replicate that in React 3.

145
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,191
So let's proceed.

146
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,901
So firstly, we need a simple, a
simple file where we'll have our

147
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,161
body tag, there we'll add canvas,
which is basically canvas is the,

148
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:27,531
as the name sounds, it's like a.

149
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:33,626
Empty paper where we'll draw our 3d scene
and then, I have selected that canvas

150
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:38,976
using document query Selector and I've
stored it in a variable called canvas.

151
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:42,666
Then we are adding one scene
Then we have our object.

152
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:47,326
So basically we are as I said object
combines geometry and material So

153
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,796
we have one three box geometry and
then the material is basic mesh basic

154
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,801
material we'll talk about this in
detail in the next few slides You And

155
00:08:56,811 --> 00:09:01,321
then combining those, geometry and
material, we are creating our mess.

156
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,711
And then we are adding
our mess to the scene.

157
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,711
So next we need a camera.

158
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,791
So there are different kinds of camera.

159
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:13,911
So the perspective camera is similar
to, like our eye, which says the objects

160
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,561
which are in far will look smaller
and the objects which are nearer to

161
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:21,566
us, This will look, bigger than we
are adding that camera to our scene.

162
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:26,846
And at last, we have one renderer,
which takes canvas as input.

163
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:31,996
And then on that canvas, it render our
scene with the viewpoint of camera.

164
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:37,256
This is, the amount of code we need
in order to create a small 3d scene.

165
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:43,046
Let's see how this thing can be done
in, React 3 Fiber and yeah, that's it.

166
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:47,516
That's all the code you need in order
to create a replicate everything that

167
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,086
we have seen in the past three slides.

168
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,566
So let's talk about this one by one.

169
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:56,946
So canvas is a component that will
be importing from React 3 Fiber.

170
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:01,126
Canvas comes prebuilt with
camera, renderer, and everything.

171
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:05,016
You don't need to specify it again
or, write it, add it to the scene.

172
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:09,351
So it has seen your camera and
renderer with some default settings,

173
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,521
obviously you can customize if needed.

174
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,001
Then, we have our geometry.

175
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,831
So torus knot is also
geometry that we'll see.

176
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,531
And then we have our, mesh basic material.

177
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,221
Once we wrap that around, mesh
or we can, wrap it with mesh.

178
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:28,121
So mace will automatically
take this geometry and material

179
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,881
and it can serve as an object.

180
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:34,071
We don't need to like
manually bind it, to mace.

181
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,511
So let's see, using an example.

182
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:41,511
So here in app JSX, I have
already imported canvas.

183
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,681
You can see right from React 3.

184
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:49,401
5 and I have For the sake of separation,
I have, I'll write the rest of the 3d code

185
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:52,361
in experience file, which is experience.

186
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,971
jsx and I'm importing that in our jsx.

187
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,116
Let's go to that file right now.

188
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:58,716
It's empty.

189
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:03,646
So as I said, we need, a mess firstly,
the rest of the things are already there.

190
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:09,946
So I will add one geometry, for
example, Taurus not geometry,

191
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:15,826
and then a material, which is right
now we are going to use miss basic.

192
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,566
And that's

193
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:18,136
it.

194
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:24,131
You can see here, we have our geometry,
but right now we can't see it.

195
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,831
Yeah, now you are able to see it.

196
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:31,991
So we have one geometry,
but it doesn't look 3d much.

197
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:35,141
So let's talk about these things first.

198
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:40,081
Then we'll add a few things in order
to make it look more realistic and 3d.

199
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,551
So let me take you to
the documentation of 3js.

200
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,181
So there are a lot of things like
how to get started and everything.

201
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:53,761
We'll talk about a few of things rest
you can explore so we have cameras

202
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:59,731
different kind of so This canvas component
has perspective camera by default if

203
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:04,211
I needed you can explore other Types
of camera and use it as per your need

204
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:09,561
then we have our geometries So there
are different kind of geometries.

205
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:14,751
So box geometry looks like something
like this Then we have, capsule

206
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:19,271
geometry, circle geometry, and
similarly a different, lot of there.

207
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,651
So what we have just right now use
this, this one, torus knot geometry.

208
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,031
So right now we are watching
it from just one side.

209
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:31,221
So it's not looks 3d enough,
rather just a plain 2d figure.

210
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,851
But we'll soon make it, more, 3d one.

211
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,091
So let's talk about, lights.

212
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,301
We'll see lights later on in detail.

213
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,891
And then we have our materials.

214
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:45,191
So there are a lot of materials
like, simple line, basic material.

215
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:51,886
Or the mostly the one that we'll be
using, or you will be using later on is

216
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:57,006
one is miss basic material, which is this
one, a material for drawing geometries

217
00:12:57,006 --> 00:13:02,586
in a simple shade, flat, or where a
wireframe way, then other one that you

218
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,646
will be using is a standard material.

219
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:09,626
So standard materials are those materials,
which basically react with the light.

220
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:13,726
So when we'll be adding light in
our project, standard materials

221
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,436
are those light, those metals,
which will react to that, lighting.

222
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:21,766
And, so we have one, miss normal
materials, which is basically,

223
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,636
which, material, which shows the
normal vectors to RGB colors.

224
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:26,676
It's like maps them.

225
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:31,851
So that you'll have a, it kinds of look
cool, but rather uses is for different

226
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:38,491
purpose for basically, what we say, we
need it for during, testing purpose or

227
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:42,991
well development phase, we need, needed
to, look into the vectors, basically.

228
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,731
So we'll be using this materials,
just for having a cool effect.

229
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,551
So instead of mesh basic material,
let's use a normal material.

230
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:55,141
See now it's looking more 3d, right?

231
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:58,681
So still right now we are
not able to interact with it.

232
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,781
And also still the camera
is placed in front of it.

233
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,591
So we're looking at the
front of this object.

234
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,431
So let's move forward and
explore the rest of the things.

235
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:16,091
So now we have, a small basic 3d scene
where we have a canvas and we have added

236
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:20,508
one object, which is not geometry and,
with the material, normal material.

237
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,930
So let's talk about XS helper.

238
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,617
So XS helper is basically a helper.

239
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:30,567
Which kind of gives you a visual reference
of all the three x's we have which is

240
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:35,767
x y and g in our 3d scene, so let's add
it in our project and for that you can

241
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:42,967
simply just add Access helper in your
simply import it and just use it So

242
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:48,177
there Is our access helper, you might
be able to see it is behind our object.

243
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:53,317
So let me just Comment it for
some time See, let me increase

244
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,227
the size of our access.

245
00:14:55,727 --> 00:15:01,747
And for that, it takes and a prop
called arcs, which will take,

246
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:06,137
the unit of how much you want
to, keep the size of that access.

247
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,297
So I'm giving it 10 right now.

248
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,717
So you can see the size increase.

249
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:17,427
So this green one is our Y axis,
red one is our X axis and G is

250
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,177
our, which is of blue blood.

251
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:24,072
it is our GX, but right now you are not
able to see that, because as I said, right

252
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:28,662
now our camera is placed in just, vertical
of this one, just at the front of it.

253
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:34,252
So the, blue line that is coming as GX,
it is like perpendicular to our camera.

254
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:36,072
That's why it is not visible right now.

255
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,712
So we'll see that blue
line just after this slide.

256
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,732
So the next one is orbit control.

257
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,552
So our orbit right now, as I
said, our camera is starting.

258
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:49,312
For example, this one is our stage and
our camera just placed at the front of it.

259
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,722
So our camera is static right now.

260
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:55,542
So orbit controls give you that,
functionality that now you can move

261
00:15:55,542 --> 00:16:00,632
your camera from left to right or
interact, zoom in or zoom out like

262
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:02,152
you saw in that NASA website, right?

263
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:07,382
Where we were able to like zoom in, zoom
out, we can just playing with the scene.

264
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,412
So let's add it to our project.

265
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:14,372
And as I said, for to set up
orbit controls, we need a lot of.

266
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:18,472
But thanks to the people at
Dray that they have created and

267
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:22,892
bundled it and you can simply just
import it from Dray and use it.

268
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,782
So I'm adding orbit
controls in our, project.

269
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:28,052
So it's added.

270
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:29,792
Now let's try to interact.

271
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:33,742
earlier when I was trying to click on
our scene or interact with it, it was

272
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,014
not responding, but let's try now.

273
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,062
So now you can see, I can
interact with our scene.

274
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:43,462
So now you are able to right now, I'm just
moved my camera from front to this side.

275
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:47,367
So now you can see, we have our
Z axis, which is a blue color.

276
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:50,907
Let's add our scene, our
object back to our scene.

277
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:57,307
So you can, just, see that our
objects start at the origin, right?

278
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,987
So from there we can, move it,
which we'll see in the next slide.

279
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,197
So now we have our orbit controls.

280
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:08,572
for the next few slides or rest of
the project, I'm just changing our,

281
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:13,962
material, basically geometry, sorry,
to some other stuff, the shape,

282
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:19,132
which is easier to visualize and
see, which is for now box geometry.

283
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:20,152
Sorry.

284
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:23,912
And instead of normal material,
I'm using basic material

285
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:24,692
here.

286
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:29,862
You can see right as, the whole surface
is plain or we can say, perpendicular.

287
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,722
So it has the same color.

288
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:36,457
But when, it has a, it had a
curved surface, in torus nodometry.

289
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:40,667
So for each of the, perpendicular
lines, there were different colors.

290
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:44,777
So it was, imitating RGB spectrum,
but right now as all this whole

291
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:49,067
surface is just a plane and all the
perpendiculars on the similar line.

292
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:50,457
So it is of same color.

293
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:53,257
So now we have our basic material.

294
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:57,317
Let's talk about properties of how
we can add color to our material.

295
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,162
So simply you need to pass color prop.

296
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:05,062
And whatever the color you need,
I'll go with, medium purple.

297
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,592
So right now we have our box
object, which is placed at origin.

298
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:13,642
If you can see it is like
at the center of our scene.

299
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:18,002
So now let's move forward and
talk about transformations.

300
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:21,062
So for transformations, we
have basically three things.

301
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:24,422
One is positioning where like
we can change the location of

302
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,352
our object in our 3d scene.

303
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,747
right now it is that you can see at the
center we can move it like in any of

304
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:36,507
the axis Also, we can rotate that object
around it any of the axis and the last

305
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:39,237
one is like scaling that object Okay.

306
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,007
so let's see these with
the help of some examples.

307
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:48,927
So in order to change that, We
can simply pass Position prop in

308
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:54,087
our object and which takes three,
parameters X, Y, Z respectively.

309
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:59,157
So let me try to move it, on
X axis, one unit and I'll keep

310
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:00,877
the rest, as zero zero only.

311
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,427
So now, just see that,
this box moved one unit.

312
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:10,537
On the x axis similarly, you can make
it negative one and it will go to the

313
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:17,937
other side of negative x axis Similarly,
you can, add two other Axis and now

314
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:23,167
you can see Our object is like at
equidistant from each of the axis like

315
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:28,857
one unit from z one unit from x and one
unit from y Okay, similarly rotation

316
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:35,262
So just instead of position, you can
pass rotation and similarly, it will

317
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:37,162
take the parameters for X, Y, and Z.

318
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:39,222
So let me add.

319
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:44,302
So if you'll see from this side,
so our X axis is going that way.

320
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:46,262
So I've added rotation of one.

321
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:49,942
So our object was like, this
one first and it rotated.

322
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:54,012
On the x axis one so
you can see the changes.

323
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:58,282
Let me add it one by one like
incrementally you add one

324
00:19:58,682 --> 00:19:59,812
and you will see the effect.

325
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:04,082
So two, you can see it rotating rate.

326
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:08,572
Similarly, I can rotate it backwards.

327
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:13,537
So this is way on the way you can rotate
or move your object in our 3d sequence.

328
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,427
The last one is scaling.

329
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:20,877
So as the name, as we did with rotation
and position We need to pass scale prop

330
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:26,557
which will take one, input Like how much
you want to scale your object for let's

331
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:31,677
suppose consider right now We have one
unit so we can just make the size double

332
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:37,157
or we can make it half of our original
So that's how basically scale works.

333
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:42,247
So these are the transformations
Of positioning rotation and

334
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,757
scaling next one is animations.

335
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:50,107
So animations, like we all know the
basic definition that, series of pictures

336
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:54,767
when sewn together at like less interval
of time, it looks like an animation.

337
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:56,337
So that's the same thing here.

338
00:20:56,437 --> 00:21:00,147
We have a code which will
execute on every frame render.

339
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:03,897
So for example, our renderer is
rendering some frames one by one

340
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,637
after some certain, amount of time.

341
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:11,657
So we have, we'll have a code that
will render on each frame, which will

342
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,467
give us an impression of animation.

343
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,562
And for that, we'll be using
a used frame hook, which will

344
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,362
basically give access to each frame.

345
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:23,812
And then we can animate any
object using, by changing the

346
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:26,842
properties of transformations like
position, rotation, and scale.

347
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:28,972
So let's, see them one by one.

348
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,732
So as I said, first, we will need, useRAM.

349
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,902
So this one, has two params.

350
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:37,662
One is state and another one is delta.

351
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,142
I'll talk about this one by one.

352
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,802
next, in order to, now we have our frame.

353
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:46,382
Let me talk, let's talk about state first.

354
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:49,952
So state basically, contains the data.

355
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,152
about the scene, right?

356
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:55,052
So let me console log it and check it.

357
00:21:55,552 --> 00:22:03,712
So if you'll see here we have details
about camera clock or you can mouse

358
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:09,882
pointer so we have information about
all the different things or objects

359
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:16,072
in our Scene that we can use to modify
or customize it And also you can see

360
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:20,702
right now it is, this console dot log
is being rendered on each frame, right?

361
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:24,962
You can see it's still being rendering
one by one, one way on after, in

362
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:26,792
each frame it is being rendered.

363
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,542
It will go on.

364
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,292
so let me remove that.

365
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:29,977
Okay.

366
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:30,161
Bye.

367
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,182
Or wait, let me talk about Delta.

368
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,252
So what is Delta?

369
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:37,842
Delta is basically, you can say
that time difference between the

370
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:41,262
last frame that was rendered and the
next frame that will be rendered.

371
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,162
So let me console look that

372
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:45,462
so you can see that.

373
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:51,801
So this is the amount of times,
which is in a second 0 1 0 1 6.

374
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:55,782
so this is the amount of time that
is the difference between, let's

375
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:57,902
suppose if I stop, take any two one.

376
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:02,552
So this one was the frame rendered and
the next one, the frame was rendered.

377
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:04,302
So 0.

378
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:07,852
16 on average is the kind of like the
difference between two frames, the

379
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:09,222
time difference between two frames.

380
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,122
And if we remove our console.

381
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:15,712
log, so now we have a frame, a
use frame hook, which will, which

382
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:17,222
gives us access to each frame.

383
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:23,082
But now we need to add some
transformations in our object for that.

384
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:25,112
We'll be using a reference.

385
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:31,742
So we'll create one ref for our
box, which we'll call box ref, and

386
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:35,362
then we'll import user, from react.

387
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:37,942
Now we'll attach that to our object.

388
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:42,022
So now our reference has
been attached to our object.

389
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:49,222
Now, we have access to our reference and
it will, it has one property called Which

390
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:55,752
has, other properties, one is position,
then we can just target any axis.

391
00:23:56,032 --> 00:24:01,392
For example, I'm taking X and what
I'm going to do is that on each

392
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:07,837
frame, I'm adding one unit to the X,
position of our object in the X axis.

393
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:09,237
So let's try that.

394
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:14,397
So you can see that right now, our
object just went in the x axis one unit.

395
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:17,877
So let me just turn it this side.

396
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,977
So you'll have a better idea.

397
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:24,337
Let me refresh it and
start our screen again.

398
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:28,547
So it was too fast to see because
one unit is too much for it.

399
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,697
So let me reduce it to zero one, zero one.

400
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:34,517
Let me refresh our scene.

401
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,707
So now you can see that
our object is moving.

402
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,262
0.

403
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:43,362
01 unit on each frame, right?

404
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:47,902
Similarly, So there is a thing
like a unit about unit side.

405
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:54,312
So there are different configurations
for example 30 fps or 60 fps So if we are

406
00:24:54,312 --> 00:25:00,092
going with, units, then we'll have a diff,
different experience in, these, system.

407
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:06,172
For example, let's suppose we have a 30
FPS scheme, a screen, and I'm adding one

408
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,502
unit to our, Object on each frame, right?

409
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:13,472
So after, we can say 30 frames per second.

410
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:19,182
So after one second, our object will be
30 units ahead of its original position.

411
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:25,102
And in 60 FPS screen, what will happen
is that after the end of one second,

412
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:30,222
now, as we are adding one unit and it
has 60 frames per second, so it will be

413
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:33,412
60 units ahead of its original position.

414
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:38,882
So these, the same animation will look
different on, different configurations

415
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:43,782
to, in order to make a similar, give a
similar experience in all the devices.

416
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,442
We use Delta.

417
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:49,052
as I said, Delta is the time
difference between two frames, right?

418
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:54,882
But if you're taking, if you're going
to use Delta, then even after one

419
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:59,342
second, this object here will, the
animation will not be that smooth

420
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:05,592
in 30 FPS as like time differences
greater in 30 FPS between frames,

421
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:08,397
than the time difference in 60 FPS.

422
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:14,317
Between the frame so the animation in
60 fps will look a bit smooth as the

423
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:20,127
time duration is less So the object
will go like tick but in 30 fps the

424
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:23,417
animation will be not that smooth
because the time difference is greater.

425
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:28,342
So the object will move tick But
at the end of the day means at the

426
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:31,602
end of one second, the both objects
will be at the same position.

427
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:36,732
So now, even after, we have a different
configuration, but the animation will

428
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:40,042
look, the same, in different devices.

429
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,852
For that reason, only instead of
going with plain units, we'll be

430
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,372
using Delta for our animations.

431
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,242
So let me do it.

432
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,841
So now you can see our
object is going similarly.

433
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,612
Similarly, you can target any other axis.

434
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,082
Why let me rephrase my scene, right?

435
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,672
similarly, instead of position,
you can go with rotation.

436
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:01,522
Okay.

437
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:05,472
Or along x axis, right?

438
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:09,322
And similarly, you can
also target scaling.

439
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:10,582
So let me.

440
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:11,522
Okay.

441
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:16,542
Since it's like scaling the object
along the X axis and adding,

442
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:19,292
Delta on each frame render.

443
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,992
So now we have the monkey
king stuff with us.

444
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:28,052
So let's move, that's about animations,
like how you can, use, use framework.

445
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:33,357
To get access to each frame then
using a reference we attach to our

446
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:38,457
mesh which is basically our object
and then we modified our Properties

447
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:43,407
like rotation or position scaling in
order to create an emission effect

448
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,947
So let's talk about
environment and staging.

449
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:52,157
So till now we are only kind of playing
with our object not with the Environment

450
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:56,392
surrounding it So instead of object,
now let's play with our environment.

451
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,212
So first, lighting.

452
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:02,862
So lighting is to give more
realism and depth to our 3D scenes.

453
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:05,431
Till now, we don't have
any light in our, scene.

454
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:10,591
We can say in our 3d scene, but
still we are able to see the object

455
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:15,991
because as I said Mace basic material
don't need lighting rather my

456
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:18,101
standard material needs lighting.

457
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:21,341
So we'll see that There are
different types of light Ambient

458
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:25,061
directional point and spotlight which
we'll discuss in the next slide.

459
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:29,086
Mostly we'll be using today
ambient and directional light rest,

460
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,066
you can use and explore later.

461
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:36,136
So there are different properties of
lights that we can tweak with color

462
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:43,393
intensity position, and then when we
add light to our, all 3d scene, it now

463
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,903
gives us access to add shadows to it.

464
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,663
As when there will be lights,
there will be shadows.

465
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,813
So we'll talk about shadows
separately later on.

466
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,983
So let's talk about
different types of light.

467
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,823
Firstly, we have one ambient light.

468
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,583
So ambient light is like a general
enumeration that affects all

469
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,183
objects equally irrespective.

470
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:06,063
Then we have a directional light which
is like a sunlight or a distant light.

471
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:11,103
So directional light is as the name
suggests it is somewhere As like

472
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:16,368
sun and it is directing its light
to our object Then we have point

473
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:20,318
light, which is I said, similar to
directional light, but a bit different.

474
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:23,508
So it is it emits light in all
directions from a single point.

475
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:25,728
And then we have a spotlight.

476
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:27,668
So spotlight is similar to flashlight.

477
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:31,308
So imagine, keeping a
flashlight in front of a wall.

478
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:35,368
You will see a round, light, And
apart from those and those around

479
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:38,438
circle, the rest area will be on dark.

480
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:41,888
So similar kind of effect
you will get using spotlight.

481
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,448
So let's see a few examples.

482
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:48,228
So as I said, in order
to, let me remove our.

483
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,103
Okay.

484
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:55,503
Now let me also remove
our scale and rotation.

485
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,033
So now we have our initial scene
where we are, with our access

486
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:04,213
helper and our basic box object.

487
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:08,963
So instead of basic material,
let's switch to standard

488
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:11,063
material, which reacts to light.

489
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,013
which needs basically light.

490
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:17,763
so I just, converted our object
from a MACE basic material

491
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:18,713
to MACE standard material.

492
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:25,053
Now you can see our object is there, but
even I have assigned a color of medium

493
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:30,513
purple, it's in black color because
it's not black, it's actually dark.

494
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:34,783
So as it is dark, we are not able
to see the color of our object.

495
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:38,023
Let's add lighting to our project.

496
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:41,343
And for that, as I said,
we can use ambient light.

497
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:46,253
So now as I added light to our,
environment 3d scene, you can see

498
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:51,823
as the definition was embedded
light, illuminates our, the whole

499
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:53,803
scene, irrespective from all sides.

500
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:59,293
So you can see, now we can see all the
sides of our, object is illuminated.

501
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:03,983
Let's see then directional light
also, you can play with intensity.

502
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:09,883
So if I add intensity on suppose
four, you can see the intensity

503
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:11,333
of the light is increased.

504
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,463
So instead of ambient light,
let's use directional light.

505
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:18,333
So now you can see, as I
said, the directional light is

506
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,993
right at the top, like a sun.

507
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:26,428
So the top surface of our box object,
it is now illuminated, but rest of

508
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,368
the sites, it is like still in dark.

509
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,188
that's why it's like black color.

510
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:35,028
So let's move our object,
light, position off.

511
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:40,508
So now, let's, I'm, keeping my light
like equidistant at the positive side

512
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:43,338
of our origin, which is, one unit.

513
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:47,218
So let's imagine our light is around here.

514
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,118
Right now.

515
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:53,498
So that's why the light is coming
from this side and you can see these

516
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:57,248
three faces They are like being
illuminated because our light is

517
00:31:57,258 --> 00:32:00,308
somewhere around At front right now.

518
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:05,873
So these three faces are illuminated But
the other three sides, which are away

519
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:08,033
from the light, they are still in dark.

520
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:11,393
So this is like how
directional light works.

521
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:15,053
So let's move forward
and talk about shadows.

522
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:21,163
So shadows as lighting, add more realism
shadows, add more depth and realism to

523
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:25,913
our 3d scenes by simulating, like how the
light interact with objects right now.

524
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:31,298
So we have a object and we have
a light, but we don't have any

525
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,678
shadows or other things right now.

526
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:38,488
So it also helps viewers to understand
the position and scale of objects

527
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,478
related to other object and environment.

528
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:46,098
And also one thing to keep in mind
that adding shadows is like, more

529
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,168
will take away some performance.

530
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:53,008
So adding too much of shadows here and
there, like in every object will make

531
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:55,228
your website, a bit slower or laggy.

532
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,758
So we'll have to keep in mind
when adding shadows, which are the

533
00:32:58,828 --> 00:33:03,628
objects that actually need shadow
in our whole 3d scene, or which

534
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:04,798
are the things we can ignore.

535
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:05,668
Okay.

536
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:08,538
So let's add some shadow, in our project.

537
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,988
So for that, firstly, you will need
to enable your canvas to have the

538
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:18,428
functionality of shadow and which is
simply by just giving a prop of shadows.

539
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:24,048
And now our canvas supports, shadows
and next, so I'll be right now.

540
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:24,968
We have one object.

541
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:28,268
We don't have anything in
order to capture that shadow.

542
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:28,358
Okay.

543
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:32,948
Oh, so we need something like
a ground, below our objects.

544
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:37,188
So whenever we'll have a sunlight,
so when there is object, it will

545
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:38,888
cast its shadow that ground.

546
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:43,768
So let me add a plane just below our,

547
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:47,638
let me add it first and I'll
explain, which is not much actually.

548
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,578
We are just using it in a different way.

549
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:53,398
So right now we have a ground like thing.

550
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:59,198
Let me refresh it and just okay So
it is a like instead of box geometry.

551
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:03,128
It is a plane geometry Then we have
mesh standard material which supports

552
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:09,468
lighting which is of green yellow
color Okay and then I have rotated it

553
00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:15,263
along x axis, perpendicularly or Yeah
Like it was firstly like this, and

554
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,403
then I went, rotated it for like this.

555
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:26,023
And then I have scaled our, plane and I
have just moved it at the minus Y axis

556
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:29,023
down a bit so that it is below our object.

557
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:29,973
Okay.

558
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,643
So now we have our plane.

559
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:33,493
Okay.

560
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,633
And our setup is ready
to, add some shadows.

561
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:39,613
So it is simply, all
you need to do is that.

562
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:46,923
Don't, Tag, which of the objects
will cast a shadow and which has

563
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,503
the object, which will receive us.

564
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:52,773
So firstly, our light
will cast a shadow, right?

565
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:59,183
Then this box will cast a shadow
and lastly, our plane that is the

566
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:01,713
ground that will receive that shadow.

567
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:03,193
So that's all you need.

568
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:03,993
Let's see.

569
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:05,383
You can see here, right?

570
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:09,013
We have our light here
somewhere one, one, one.

571
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,073
So it is, like throwing
a light in our object.

572
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:15,383
And then that object is
casting a shadow on the ground.

573
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:18,743
But, what if instead of a static?

574
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:22,513
Box, we have a a revolving
or a moving object.

575
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:25,673
So will that shadow will,
react to that moving object?

576
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:27,133
Or will it be static?

577
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:34,423
so let's see that Let me add rotation so
you can see right so on each frame render

578
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:41,423
that Shadow is again being rendered so
that is the that is the reason because

579
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:46,268
of which it's eats away performance from
your website So there are different ways,

580
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,268
right now you can see the edges, right?

581
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:49,088
Of the shadow.

582
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,098
It's a bit, blurry.

583
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:56,338
So there are different ways through which
you can make your shadow sharper and, or

584
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:58,668
more blurry in order to save performance.

585
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:02,248
So you will, when you will be
using shadows, so you will have

586
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,378
to take care of these things.

587
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:07,408
So that your website don't
result into a laggy one.

588
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:08,168
Okay.

589
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:10,298
So next talk and let's
talk about background.

590
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:15,258
So till now we have our object,
but the background is still dark.

591
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:16,978
Or we can say there is nothing there.

592
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,528
So we can add background to it.

593
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:24,018
So first one is like normal,
any color that you need to add.

594
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:28,408
So end of the day, canvas
is also one, HTML tag.

595
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:31,408
So you can simply add any
background color to it.

596
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:37,098
Let's suppose I'm adding sky blue so
you can see now we have our background

597
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:43,008
color or you can add gradients
or images or environment maps.

598
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:48,868
So let me add one picture that I clicked
on my last trip as an environment to our

599
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:52,198
3d scene and let's see how that turns out.

600
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:54,548
Let me first remove
this, background color.

601
00:36:55,048 --> 00:37:02,498
And let me, and to add environment
you simply need to, as I said, some

602
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:05,778
very good, helpful people in Trey
have already created that for us.

603
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:09,688
So you need that, you need to import
that environment component from Trey.

604
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:16,508
You need to label it as a background
And then it will take a file which

605
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,838
you will be adding it as a background.

606
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,568
So I have placed one
file here in public, pic.

607
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:27,028
jpg Which is basically a mountain
picture that we'll be using as

608
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:29,638
our background So let me put that

609
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:33,308
Okay So let me remove these things

610
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:36,278
If we don't need any more, sorry.

611
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:42,620
Okay, let me remove our box
too and also our access helper.

612
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,149
Let me refresh it.

613
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:45,781
Okay.

614
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,942
Somehow I messed up something.

615
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:49,574
Okay.

616
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:50,206
Yeah.

617
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:56,528
So let's keep it this
way and let's remove this

618
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:58,078
access at least.

619
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:00,088
So now we have our box.

620
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:02,768
And our background.

621
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:06,568
So you can see right now,
It a 360 view of that image.

622
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:10,918
but that picture was not
made in order to support 360.

623
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,728
So you can see that edges are
just trying to take a paper and

624
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:17,028
fold it and make it like a cube.

625
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:21,918
That's why like the edges are like
this way, but that's what you got the

626
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,858
idea of how to use environment maps.

627
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,448
You can easily download different
environment maps from internet.

628
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,533
Basically under licenses are free.

629
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:33,383
So yeah, that's how we add
environment to our 3d scene.

630
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:35,923
Now let's talk about models.

631
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:41,243
So basically the 3d scenes that you
will use in live projects, which will

632
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:47,533
not be only like you sand planes or
any sphere or torus symmetry, right?

633
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,333
You need models, for example,
images, or like we saw in the

634
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,193
NASA one, there was a satellite.

635
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:56,483
So that is a model that we'll be
using instead of just simple cubes.

636
00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:59,918
So models can be created
using different ways.

637
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:04,498
one simple way is using a blender,
software, which using which we can

638
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:08,688
create, models for our 3d scenes,
and then we can import it and use it.

639
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:13,598
So there are different, formats of,
Models that are supported in 3js.

640
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:16,078
the most popular one is GLTF or GLB.

641
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:18,978
And then we have an OBJ or FBX.

642
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:23,068
So as I said, models can represent
anything from like characters to

643
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,878
vehicles or entire environments.

644
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:31,448
Let's add a model in our scene to
have a more better understanding

645
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:37,148
and for that Okay, we need
to use a primitive component.

646
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:43,248
Okay, so let me first remove the animation
And let's firstly import our model first.

647
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:47,988
So I have already downloaded
one model Which is along with

648
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,148
the license and everything.

649
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:55,393
So we have our scene dot gl tf here
with us Which will be importing and

650
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:58,963
the rest of these are the like the
supporting files of that, model.

651
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:03,143
So for that we'll be using, use GLTFO.

652
00:40:03,643 --> 00:40:06,373
So let's suppose our model is here,

653
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:09,173
which is again, importing from tray.

654
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,123
And it will take the path to our model.

655
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:14,583
So which is basically slash word.

656
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:16,673
Last scene.

657
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:17,663
Dot.

658
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:19,103
So

659
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,413
now we have our model imported.

660
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:23,623
Now let's add that to our scene.

661
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:27,563
And for that, as I said, we
need a primitive component.

662
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:34,393
Okay, which will take object
which is our model dot scene

663
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:39,083
Okay, so now I have added that
but it is not visible right now.

664
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:45,063
Okay, so let's see probably Yeah,
so we have our model right now,

665
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:49,103
but it is like too bigger to
like Accommodate in our scene.

666
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:53,223
So let's scale it down So as we
already know about the properties

667
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:58,293
that you can use So scale is one of
them using which we can modify this.

668
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:02,183
Uh size of our, model or any object.

669
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:07,633
So I've tried with it with different,
numbers, like when you will be starting to

670
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:12,403
create or develop these scenes, we'll have
to play around, use hit and trial method.

671
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:19,688
To get the correct, size or another one is
like you need to make your models in order

672
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:25,768
to incorporate in your website, so you'll
have to Make it of that size that you need

673
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:30,048
instead of then you won't have to modify
it here So i've tried with different

674
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,568
units and one that I could find is like 0.

675
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:39,408
03 Okay, so now let's
remove this box Okay.

676
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:44,828
So now we have A scene where we
have an environment, a model, right?

677
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:49,518
Now, can we do everything that
we did with box with this model?

678
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:57,458
And that is absolutely yes So as we
added a reference we can add here

679
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:04,228
Let's name it as box ref Okay And
similarly we can access it like rest

680
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:09,608
of the thing Okay, so now you can see
You We have this word, which is like

681
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:12,128
how we used, animation in objects.

682
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:14,538
Similarly, same thing we
can do with this one too.

683
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,488
Also, we can go with position and

684
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:25,158
now you can see our bird
is flying in the sky.

685
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:29,448
So this is the way we can
create a small 3d scene where

686
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:31,108
like it's more interactive way.

687
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:36,218
Instead of just plain, simple
cubes and other objects.

688
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:39,658
So let's talk about deployment.

689
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:44,438
So I wanted to show you that,
now this don't look like a

690
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,378
simple HTML static site, right?

691
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:51,138
So we have, we know the normal
ways to deploy any site using

692
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:52,938
Netlify or WordCell or other stuff.

693
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:56,988
So can, so is it like a different
process to deploy these kinds

694
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,238
of websites, which are like.

695
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:01,918
You can have 3d assets and
interactive and, such stuff.

696
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:08,108
And that is totally no, you can,
as simply you created or deployed

697
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:13,348
other as plain HTML, static website,
you will can do this one also.

698
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:20,288
So just, you need to create the build
and you can deploy it as similar as like

699
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,488
Universal or Netlify or GitHub pages.

700
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:26,098
So as we all know, in a bit,
we can create the build.

701
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:32,058
using, NPM run build, and I have

702
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:33,318
already done that.

703
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:36,968
So it will create one test
folder where you will have

704
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:38,838
all the assets and like index.

705
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:44,738
html and every code like
compiled and ready to be served.

706
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:48,568
And then you can deploy this
folder anywhere like internet.

707
00:43:48,978 --> 00:43:51,348
So I've already done that in Netlify.

708
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,848
you can probably.

709
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,312
Take it if it's still live.

710
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:56,710
Okay.

711
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,507
Let's wait

712
00:43:58,007 --> 00:43:58,577
it for load.

713
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:03,137
And yeah So this is the same thing that
we just created in our local, right?

714
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,637
So I just created a a dist folder
and created a build and just

715
00:44:07,657 --> 00:44:12,337
deployed it in netlify And now you
can just access it in your website.

716
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:18,567
Yes, it's it threejs hyphen Dash
talk dash demo dot netlify dot app.

717
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:22,737
You can open it your system right
now and can check it You And

718
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:27,247
say it, and this is just a 3js.

719
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:30,087
There are a lot of things to,
you can explore on yourself.

720
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:34,707
And there are a lot of
creative ways you can use it.

721
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:40,177
Maybe let's suppose you have an existing
react project of airlines, right?

722
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:43,677
You can add a small aeroplane,
3D aeroplane that is like

723
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:45,287
flying around your website.

724
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:50,857
Or in buttons or let's suppose
you have one, hotel website.

725
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,997
So you can add a small window, a
small canvas and place it at your

726
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:59,477
website at the top corner, small
window from where a 3d safe model

727
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:02,307
is coming on the window and waving.

728
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:05,427
Sometimes it's coming with a
different days or just saying hi.

729
00:45:05,857 --> 00:45:08,907
So there are a lot of creative
ways you can think of.

730
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,227
You can use 3js in your website.

731
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,422
Either a new one or existing one.

732
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,112
so that's it from my side.

733
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:16,852
thanks.

734
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:19,652
Thank you again for being
a wonderful audience.

735
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:22,342
And I hope you have learned
something from this talk.

736
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:28,002
you can reach out to me on the cool
learning, which is my Twitter handle.

737
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:31,942
I'll be always, love to
interact with you and just talk.

738
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:33,892
So thanks again.

739
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:34,572
Bye bye.
