1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,590
Good morning.

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,150
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,970
Good evening, everyone.

4
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,360
Thank you for being here.

5
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,610
My name is Vinodupaturi.

6
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,580
I do have 11 years of experience
in the financial industry.

7
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,310
Currently, I am working as
a senior software engineer.

8
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,140
Today, I am thrilled to talk about the
subject that's not just critical for

9
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,499
financial institutions, but for everyone.

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,910
AI powered fraud.

11
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:18,555
detection.

12
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,655
Did you know the financial fraud
cost the global economy over 5.

13
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,455
4 trillion dollars annually?

14
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,074
This is a staggering number emphasize
the urgent need of innovation.

15
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,975
Today I'll be discussing how artificial
intelligence and machine learning

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,414
are transforming the fraud detection
into high efficient, proactive,

17
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:39,135
and customer friendly process.

18
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,015
Let's dive into the fundamentals
of AI powered fraud detection and

19
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:47,055
understand why it's such a revolutionary
force in financial security.

20
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,835
Billions of transactions
are processed every day.

21
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:54,775
Within these transactions,
fraudsters are hiding, adopting,

22
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:58,134
and exploiting the loopholes.

23
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,125
How do we oversmart them?

24
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,974
Using artificial intelligence.

25
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:05,764
There are three major
approaches for fraud detection.

26
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,564
Supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and deep learning.

27
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,045
Supervised learning.

28
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:15,015
AI will always thrives on
learning from the past.

29
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:19,485
Using billions of label transactions,
supervised learning algorithms

30
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:23,334
refine themselves over time
to achieve a staggering 99.

31
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,425
9 percent accuracy in the fraud detection.

32
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:30,924
For an instance, think of
how your email filters spam.

33
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:36,229
AI applies a similar concept to
transactions, but with precision sharp

34
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:42,084
enough to spot even the most complex
patterns of fraud in milliseconds.

35
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,874
Unsupervised learning.

36
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,034
Fraud isn't always static.

37
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:47,014
It evolves.

38
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:52,044
Unsupervised learning steps in
where the pattern isn't clear.

39
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:57,494
It identifies hidden threats,
the anomalies we don't know

40
00:01:57,644 --> 00:02:03,574
exist, and improves early
fraud detection by 42%, 42%.

41
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:08,624
Imagine a AI system spot unusual
behavior in the transaction from

42
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,904
a new system or a new location.

43
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:15,674
Even if it doesn't match
previous fraud patterns, AI

44
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,714
flags it for a deeper analysis.

45
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:19,004
Deep learning.

46
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:24,174
This is the powerhouse for
of modern fraud detection.

47
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:30,454
Deep learning network process thousands of
data points for transaction in real time.

48
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:33,424
This means they don't
just identify a fraud.

49
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:38,004
They stop it as it
doesn't, as it's happening.

50
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:45,794
Deep learning has slashed cardinal present
fraud by 76%, a major achievement in

51
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:51,374
the fraud against, fight against digital
fraud, real time fraud prevention.

52
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:55,444
Let's move from detection to the
prevention in the real world,

53
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,394
area where AI truly shines.

54
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:00,974
Imagine a fraudster attempt to
use a stolen credit card online.

55
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:05,129
Before the transactions can be
processed, the system flags it as

56
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,189
suspicious, blocks it, and notifies
the rightful account holder.

57
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,239
All this is happening in
a fraction of a second.

58
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,879
Prevention can be done
in three major ways.

59
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:19,979
Real time transaction analysis, behavioral
biometrics, synthetic identity detection.

60
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:21,829
Real time transaction analysis.

61
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,319
AI system analyzes 100k
transactions per second.

62
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,769
Scanning for anomalies
within a few seconds.

63
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,674
is 50 milliseconds response time.

64
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:36,344
For an instance, consider a user,
in New York whose card is currently

65
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,054
used for purchases in London.

66
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:42,644
EA immediately flags this as a potential
threat based upon the patterns like

67
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,504
unusual location and transaction size.

68
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:51,074
This level of speed ensures the
fraud in, fraud is intercepted

69
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:51,834
before it can be used.

70
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,154
can cause damage, protecting
customers and saving billions.

71
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:56,784
Behavioral biometrics.

72
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:02,024
AI studies how users
interact with their devices.

73
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:07,854
Their typing rhythms, swipe gestures, even
the pressure they apply on a touch screen.

74
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:12,944
This creates a digital fingerprint
unique to each user, which is incredibly

75
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,264
hard for a fraudster to replicate.

76
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:20,394
Behavioral biometrics have reduced
the account overtake attempt by

77
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:24,114
impressive of 89 percent accuracy.

78
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,124
Synthetic identity detection.

79
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:30,134
Fraudsters create fake identities
by combining the stolen data

80
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,504
from multiple individuals.

81
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:36,054
These synthetic identities often
go unnoticed in the transaction.

82
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:37,634
Traditional systems.

83
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:44,734
AI maps and analyzes fabricated identities
with 94 percent precision, intercepting

84
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,764
fraudulent activities before it can occur.

85
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:49,164
Use cases.

86
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:54,364
We have explored the power of AI,
how it prevents fraud in real time.

87
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:58,184
Now let's zoom in on
real world applications.

88
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,994
Real time transaction monitoring.

89
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:06,279
AI analyzes thousands of data points for
transactions like location, time, device,

90
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,349
and spending patterns within milliseconds.

91
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,899
Suspicious transactions are flagged
and blocked immediately, preventing

92
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:16,299
the fraud before it cause damage.

93
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:21,689
Let's imagine a customer card is
suddenly used to buy high value

94
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,779
items from unfamiliar locations.

95
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:30,119
AI detects this anomaly and stops the
transaction instantly, saving the customer

96
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,249
and institution from significant loss.

97
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,559
Account takeover protection.

98
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,889
Fraudsters often gain unauthorized
access to accounts using the stolen

99
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,769
credit cards and stolen credentials
or by brute force attacks.

100
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,339
Behavioral biometrics
and machine learning 5.

101
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:54,209
Deviations in the user behavior
such as login patterns, device

102
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:00,589
usage, and to identify and
stop these unauthorized access.

103
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:05,889
AI neutralizes account takeover
attempts and protects both customers

104
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,799
data and institutional trust.

105
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,379
Synthetic identity fraud mitigation.

106
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:14,859
Synthetic, synthetic fraud is one
of the fastest growing threat where

107
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,269
fraudsters create fake identities using
the mix of the real and fabricated data.

108
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,269
AI cross reference the data
patterns across multiple systems,

109
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,219
identifying inconsistencies that
human investigators might miss.

110
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,829
AI prevents 87 percent of synthetic
fraud attempts saving institutions

111
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,649
billions of dollars annually.

112
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,109
For an instance, if the loan
application is flagged as a suspicious

113
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:44,139
due to the mismatched identity
details, AI can block the process

114
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,239
before any funds are dispersed.

115
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,139
Phishing detection and prevention.

116
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,789
Phishing is one of the most common
and, common entry point for the fraud.

117
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,339
Natural language processing scans
communications like emails, messages, and

118
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:07,279
calls, for phishing keywords and patterns
and the links blocking them in real time.

119
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,519
Impact.

120
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,269
Institutions intercept phishing
attacks before they reach customers

121
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,709
and ensuring their safety.

122
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,279
AI protects every aspect of the
financial ecosystem, from individual

123
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,579
transactions to large scale operations.

124
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,019
This solution doesn't just respond to
fraud, they anticipate and prevent it.

125
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,309
By safeguarding accounts and transactions,
AI strengthens the bond between

126
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,179
institutions and their customers.

127
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,919
Implementation roadmap.

128
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,629
To realize the future, organizations
need a clear and actionable roadmap.

129
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,559
Let's discuss the steps to
simplify the implementation

130
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,349
and AI powered fraud detection.

131
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,999
Building a robust AI fraud
detection system isn't just

132
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,649
about deploying algorithms.

133
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:56,709
It's about the strategy, alignment,
and continuous improvement.

134
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,419
Define objectives.

135
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,669
Conduct a comprehensive internal
assessment to map out a plan.

136
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,009
fraud detection goals and align
them with overall risk assessment

137
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,979
and risk management strategies.

138
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,959
For an instance, if your goal is
to reduce a fraud by 50 percent and

139
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,089
ensure the customer's trust, define
it clearly to guide your approach.

140
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,449
Data assessment.

141
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,259
Data Audit your existing
data infrastructure to

142
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:27,479
ensure quality diversity.

143
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,569
Poor quality data leads to
biased and ineffective AI models.

144
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:38,359
For an instance, if an organization may
discover gaps in the data collection, like

145
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:45,194
missing behavioral insights and address
them before training their AI systems.

146
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,144
Model selection and training.

147
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:52,374
Experiments, experiment with multiple
models leveraging advanced machine

148
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:56,694
learning techniques like supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning.

149
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:02,024
Choosing the model that adapts to evolve
the threads and provide explainability.

150
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,994
Deployment and monitoring.

151
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,004
Rolling out the AI in phases.

152
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,699
with continuous performance
tracking and the feedback loops to

153
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,689
refine defect detection mechanism.

154
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:17,459
Fraud detection is not like
a fight and forgot effort.

155
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,719
It requires a real time adaptability.

156
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,489
For an instance, if an organization
deploys AI for online payment first,

157
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:31,779
refine it accurately before expanding
to the other regions or demographics

158
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,469
or maybe other type of transactions.

159
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,039
Benefits of AI powered fraud detection.

160
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:43,019
We have seen how AI detects and prevents
fraud while enhancing customer experience.

161
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:48,199
Now let's focus on the game
changing benefits that makes AI must

162
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,179
have for financial institutions.

163
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,539
Fraud isn't just a cost, it's a threat.

164
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,564
to trust, efficiency,
and customer loyalty.

165
00:09:56,784 --> 00:10:01,594
With AI, we are not just fighting
fraud, we are transforming the way

166
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,804
business operates, protects, and grows.

167
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:07,114
Let's break this down for you.

168
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:08,634
Reduce fraud loss.

169
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:12,824
Every fraudulent transaction costs
not only money but reputation.

170
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:18,024
By intercepting the fraud at a source,
AI prevents the loss before they occur.

171
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:19,944
Enhance security.

172
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,284
Traditional security systems
rely on static rules.

173
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,749
Can't keep up with evolving threats.

174
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:27,129
