1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello, this is Vamsi.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,710
let me do, let me introduce myself.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,069
so I have like overall 16 years of
experience in, cloud and platform

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,130
engineering, with special, with,
specialization in infrastructure

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,849
automation and digital transformation.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,320
today I'm going to, give,
introduction, like session on,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,990
mostly Like today's the world is
changing, evolving with, completely

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,470
into the multi cloud environments.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,370
Like we are not locked.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,590
With one cloud provider.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,140
So like we are currently like, going
with the multiple cloud providers,

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,700
AWS like a, Azure and GCP and whatnot,
so it is very, challenging and like

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,920
implementing, security, across a multiple
cloud platforms actually for our hosting.

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:41,985
Or application infrastructure.

15
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:47,255
So today I'm going to most deep dive
into the DevSecOps strategies for

16
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:51,015
enhanced security and compliance
in this, multi cloud era.

17
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,584
so the shift to multi
cloud is accelerating.

18
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:57,905
So with, with organizational leveraging
diverse cloud platform, cloud

19
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,025
providers for agility and scalability
and redundancy, but securing this

20
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,535
complex ecosystem is critical.

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,290
So this presentation explores how to
integrate security seamlessly into

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,240
DevOps workflows, enabling organizations
to thrive in the multi cloud era.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,600
So let's deep dive into it.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,740
so we, let's discuss about
the importance of DevSecOps.

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,080
so we are at the two, two pillars here.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,110
Like one is a shiftlet security and then
other one is a continuous integration

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,560
and, integration and delivery.

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,260
so what is shift left security?

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,940
DevSecOps fundamentally.

30
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:39,515
transform security by integrating it
from the earlier stages of development.

31
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:44,075
By embedding security practices through
the software development lifecycle,

32
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:49,095
teams can identify and remediate
vulnerabilities earlier, reduce costs,

33
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:51,715
and build security first applications.

34
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,445
This proactive approach creates a
collaborative and, collaborative

35
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,105
culture where security becomes
everybody's responsibility.

36
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,995
It's let's discuss about shift lifecycle.

37
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:05,815
Earlier, back in the days, back in the
days, we used to have a SDLC lifecycle

38
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:11,055
and when we used to have a, like a,
let's go to the, like a, if you have

39
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:16,275
a code, like a code developer and
then push to the higher environments.

40
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,015
We'll come to.

41
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,755
do the testing of, application and
even the security testing we will

42
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,485
be doing at the stage of, before
we even go to the production.

43
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:27,895
at that point of time, it's becoming
it will become, hard for any, it will

44
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,655
be, let's say, for example, if some,
something happens, let's say, for

45
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:34,465
example, if we identify vulnerabilities
at the stage of hey, we have a release

46
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:37,815
in next week or so, let's say, for
example, We will have hardly one

47
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:41,405
week to fix the security issues,
which will be difficult to do that.

48
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:45,425
in that case, we should have
a mechanism of identifying

49
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,785
the security vulnerabilities
in the early stages of SDLC.

50
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:52,365
So the shift left security approach,
which we, most of the organizations

51
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,245
right now adopting so that they can,
so that they can, do the continuous,

52
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,805
testing while they're developing.

53
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:00,695
so while they're developing,
that's about shift left security.

54
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:05,575
So another thing is like a CACD,
you might have, we are very much

55
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,985
familiar with CACD, since a decade.

56
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:12,115
It's a, it's more of automated
security, like what CACD, so how,

57
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:16,835
how can we integrate this automated
security and validations in CACD.

58
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:20,085
So here is the thing, automated
security testing and validation with

59
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:24,305
the CACD pipelines is like revolution,
deployment safety by incorporating

60
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:28,805
security scans and compliance,
checks and vulnerability assessments

61
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,495
directly into the automated pipeline.

62
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:35,815
Organizations can, confidently deploy code
faster while, robust security standards.

63
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:40,345
This systematic approach ensures
consistent security, practices

64
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:41,985
across all the deployments.

65
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:46,805
so it's more of so we like implementing,
security, scans and vulnerability

66
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:50,725
checks, like by introducing them
into the CI CD pipeline so that let's

67
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:53,945
say, for example, before deploying
to any code into the environment.

68
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:54,410
So let's see.

69
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,640
do the security scans and
compliance checks and vulnerability

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,470
assessments before even deploying
in, into the environment.

71
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,470
So it's a stage actually.

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,540
so it's like we, we were like
implementing, introducing, sec,

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,940
security steps, security scan
steps, before deploying to the

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,200
core, to the any environment.

75
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,260
so it's more of integrating, so we need
to integrate with the CSCD pipelines.

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,981
And, next thing is.

77
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:21,635
So the key, so let's discuss about key
principles of DevSecOps for multi cloud.

78
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,855
So that the three things actually.

79
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,765
so we need to discuss, we need to
deep dive into the key principles

80
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,305
of DevSecOps for multi cloud.

81
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,095
so we need to discuss about three things.

82
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:33,325
One is like a policy as a code
and, automated, secure testing.

83
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:36,105
And the third one is continuous
monitoring threat detection.

84
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,525
So when it comes to policy as
code, what is policy as code?

85
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:44,045
so the policy as a code is, means so
what it does is it transforms security

86
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:49,205
requirements into executable code,
enabling automated policy enforcements

87
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:54,855
and compliance checks across multiple
clouds, such as AWS, Azure and

88
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,185
Google cloud and other platforms.

89
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:02,795
This approach eliminates manual errors
and ensures consistent security standards.

90
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,635
And, and then, so when, then coming to
the automated, security testing, so what

91
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:11,435
it does it's, it, what it does is by
introducing automated security testing, so

92
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:16,105
it, what it does is embedded, it will, it
will provide comprehensive security scans

93
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:20,755
into your deployment pipeline, including
SAS, DAST, and, container security checks.

94
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,905
This project to approach catches
one of vulnerabilities before they

95
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:29,955
reach production and it will reduce
the risk and, and, reduce the,

96
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:31,895
total operational costs actually.

97
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:35,085
and another thing is when it
comes to continuous monitoring

98
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,065
and threat detection.

99
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:40,275
so by, by, by leveraging, AI powered
security tools, that provides

100
00:05:40,315 --> 00:05:43,735
a real time visibility across
a multi cloud infrastructure.

101
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:48,525
So what it, with incorporating AI powered
security tools, this will automatically,

102
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:53,525
correlate security events and detects
anomal anomalities and enable rapid

103
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:57,335
incident, response and maintain, and
maintain robust security, posture.

104
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:01,165
And, so what are the benefits
of DevSecOps in multi-cloud?

105
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,295
so it's mainly provides
to two key, key benefits.

106
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:07,295
One is reduced compliance
violations and other one is a

107
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:09,125
faster time to market, let's say.

108
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,305
co compliance, reducing compliance
violence is so the, by implementing these

109
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:19,185
DevSecOps in the multi-cloud environments,
Seeing 40 percent reduction in compliance

110
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:24,525
violation through automated, security
checks and, standardized, control across

111
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,005
the platform, which is, Great thing.

112
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:30,695
And, other thing is a faster to market,
by automating security, processes

113
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:34,635
and shift left, by, by integrating,
by, let's say, let's, having a,

114
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:38,165
having the strategy of implementing
automation, automated securities

115
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:40,455
testing and, shift left approach.

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,385
so shift left approach and DevOps,
DevSecOps, principle, principles.

117
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,200
so by, by co correlating like, by
coordinating, by implementing and

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,835
coordinating, automation testing and
shift lift approach, and DevSecOps so

119
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:57,635
we can accelerate, development cycles
by 25% at least, while strengthening

120
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:01,575
the security through, continuous testing
and early vulnerability detection.

121
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,545
And so the next slide, are we
gonna discuss about addressing

122
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:06,635
multicloud challenges.

123
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,145
So we definitely in this growing,
fast phase, everybody or, every

124
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:14,845
company, every, it organization, any
application infrastructure is scattered

125
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,845
across multiple, Cloud platform.

126
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,915
so what are the challenges having
a multiple cloud platforms?

127
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,875
so one thing first, like
we have three, three, three

128
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,015
standards, like three challenges.

129
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,775
So one is like a vendor lock
in and the second one is a

130
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,075
cross platform, discrepancies.

131
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,555
And the third one is a
global compliance standards.

132
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,665
so let's discuss about
like vendor lock in.

133
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:39,845
so when, so we will be deploying,
so to, to address these challenges,

134
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:42,875
like what we have to do is to address
this vendor lock in, challenges.

135
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,875
So here, we need to deploy platform
independent architectures and,

136
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,925
standardized APIs to maintain
operational freedom across

137
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:55,155
cloud platforms while reducing
dependencies on proprietary services.

138
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,615
And the second thing is cross,
cross platform discrepancies.

139
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,110
So when it comes to this area, so we
need to establish a unified security

140
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,530
frameworks and automated compliance
checks to maintain, consistent

141
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,250
security controls and risk management
across diverse cloud environments.

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,580
And then, third one is,
global compliance standards.

143
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,235
so the, what we need to do, we
need to implement a comprehensive

144
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:26,695
data governance frameworks that
automatically enforce regulatory

145
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:32,255
requirements like A-G-D-P-R and HIPAA
while, enabling real time, compliance

146
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,140
monitoring across, cloud platforms.

147
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,700
So, let's come to the real world
examples of DevSecOps in multi-cloud.

148
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,430
So we have a two case studies.

149
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,200
So one case study is like a in a
fortune 500 retail and the second one

150
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,720
is a global, banking corporation So a
global retail leader with 20 billion

151
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,560
annual revenue transformed their
security landscape through DevSecOps

152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,140
adoption by implementing, automated
security scanning and Compliance checks

153
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,060
across AWS and Azure environments.

154
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,680
They achieved 35 percent reduction
in compliance Violations cut,

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,380
security incident response, time
from, days to hours and accelerated

156
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,950
deployment frequency by days.

157
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,390
3x and so and coming to other global
banking corporation like A major

158
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,160
financial services firm like processing
over 1 million transactions daily

159
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,820
revolutionized their security approach
by integrating automated vulnerability

160
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,180
scanning into their CICD pipeline this
resulted, in detecting 40 40 percent

161
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,775
more security issues during development
and reducing production Instance by 60

162
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:45,305
percent and, decreasing time to market
a new feature by 21st percent while

163
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,015
maintaining strict regulatory compliance.

164
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,215
so these are the best, recent,
case studies, best, which will give

165
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,505
a real time DevSecOps, benefits
in multi cloud environments.

166
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:58,745
And the key, and let's come to the
key takeaways, for, with the DevSecOps

167
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:00,985
for secure and compliant multi cloud.

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,200
so one, like I can say
three, takeaways, takeaways.

169
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,800
So one is enhance a culture of
security, so what it does mean?

170
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,030
so with this, we will be
transforming organizational mindset

171
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,900
by integrating security practices
into daily workflows and making

172
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,550
cybersecurity a core value across
all development and operation teams.

173
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,900
And the second thing is
automated security testing.

174
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,990
So by implementing comprehensive
automated security scanning and

175
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,150
testing throughout CACD pipelines to
identify and remediate vulnerabilities

176
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,500
before each production, before they
reach even production environments.

177
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,350
And the third thing is
a continuous monitoring.

178
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,950
So here, we'll be, so we'll be deploying
advanced, threat detection systems

179
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,850
and real time security, analytics to
maintain, resilient oversight of your

180
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,810
multi cloud infrastructure and respond
rapidly to potential security, incidents.

181
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,080
And so let's discuss so far we
discussed, all high level, how, and

182
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,640
what and how to implement, these
principles and, and methodology.

183
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,460
but here in this slide, we are going to
discuss, that, tools and technologies

184
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,830
for, DevSecOps in multi cloud environment.

185
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,180
so three things we need to discuss.

186
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,090
So one is for cloud security posture,
one is like cloud security, posture

187
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,050
management, so which will CSPM will
continuously monitor and assess cloud,

188
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,130
security risks through automated
security assessments and compliance

189
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,865
monitoring and, real time mis confi,
misconfiguration detection across

190
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,895
the AWS Azure and GCP environments.

191
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:36,965
And the second thing is like a cloud
security information and event management.

192
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:42,875
so what SIA, will, this will, leverage, AI
powered analytics to correlate, security

193
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:48,685
data across cloud platforms, enabling,
rapid threat detection, automated incident

194
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,195
response and a comprehensive security.

195
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,610
audit trails for compliance reporting.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,050
And the third one is which is
critical is a container security.

197
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,630
So today the world we are moving from,
monolithic to microservice architecture.

198
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,970
container, using containers
is like becoming and.

199
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:08,445
Part of a daily, daily
operation and development life.

200
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:12,858
So in this case, we'll be implementing,
automated, like we need to implement

201
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:17,991
like, implement automated vulnerability
scanning and runtime protection and policy

202
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:24,421
informants for Docker and Kubernetes
workflows, ensuring security container

203
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:28,801
deployments from, development through
production across all, environments.

204
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:32,761
And, the next slide like we'll be
discussing here is, the future of

205
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:36,191
multi cloud security and what are
the emerging trends like, here is,

206
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:40,501
three things actually like for, these
are the, these three, items are like

207
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:44,081
more of emerging and, we need to
implement in a, in upcoming future.

208
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:47,681
one is like a serverless security
and the second one is, artificial,

209
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:51,381
intelligence for security and
third one is zero trust security.

210
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:57,111
So when it comes to serverless security,
um, advanced runtime protection and

211
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,621
the functional level monitoring for
serverless, architecture to secure,

212
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:04,561
so we, so we need to implement
advanced, runtime protection and,

213
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,421
functional level monitoring for
serverless architecture to secure.

214
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:11,746
Cloud native applications and
prevent unauthorized executions.

215
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:16,536
And the second thing is the next
generation security, powered by AI

216
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:20,666
algorithm, like we need to, develop
next generation security powered by

217
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:25,996
AI algorithm that can continuously
learn from threats, predict potential

218
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:30,686
attacks, and automatically orchestrate
responses across multi cloud environments.

219
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,666
And the third thing is
like zero trust security.

220
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:38,936
it's contest aware security framework
like, that verifies every access

221
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:43,956
request, regardless of source and,
enforcing strict identity verification,

222
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:48,486
and, least privileged access,
access across all cloud services.

223
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,226
So these are the three things like
emerging trends, which, which we

224
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:54,036
need to, aware and look forward.

225
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:57,796
And what are the actionable steps
for implementing DevSecOps in

226
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,206
your multi cloud environment?

227
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,256
So there's the four, four action items.

228
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:04,816
Like one is what first most thing what
you need to do is access current security

229
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:09,166
poster like, for that, you need to
conduct a thorough, security audit across

230
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:15,036
all cloud platforms, identifying gaps
in infrastructure, applications, and,

231
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:20,156
processes while mapping potential attack,
vectors and, compliance requirements.

232
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:24,476
And the second one is, develop
security policies and standards.

233
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:29,006
Need to create a comprehensive security
frameworks aligned with industry

234
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:33,806
best practices establishing clear
guidelines for access controls data

235
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,546
protection and Incident response
across your multi cloud ecosystem.

236
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:44,216
And the third one is integrate security
tools and automation So here we need to

237
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:50,476
do is what we need to do is deploy and
configure automated security scanning and

238
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:56,666
vulnerability assessment and compliance
checking tools within your CICD pipeline,

239
00:14:56,746 --> 00:15:01,146
ensuring seamless integration with
the existing development workflows.

240
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:05,376
And the fourth one, what we need,
and the next step is establish

241
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,026
continuous monitoring and response.

242
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:11,951
Here we need to implement real time
security monitoring with automated alerts.

243
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:17,361
Detailed logging and rapid response
procedures, enabling, proactive

244
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:21,231
threat detection and swift remediation
across all cloud environments.

245
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:25,621
And, securiting, securing the multicloud,
error is a, it's not a journey.

246
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,221
It's a, it's a journey.

247
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,421
It's not a destination.

248
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:33,271
securing the multicloud environment
is not just a technical challenge.

249
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:37,076
It's it's a transformational
journey, that detects continuous

250
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,676
evaluation and a commitment.

251
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,826
through this strategic implementation
of DevSecOps principle, organizations

252
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:48,836
can build resilient, security frameworks
that adopt, adopt, emerging threats while

253
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,896
maintaining comp maintaining compliance
across, diverse cloud platforms.

254
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,486
The proactive approach not only
protects virtual assets but also

255
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:02,306
Enables innovation, accelerate,
accelerates our deployment cycles

256
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:07,956
and, create a competitive advantage
in today's dynamic digital landscape.

257
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:11,876
thank you all for, attending
this, session and I hope you

258
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,386
enjoyed, my presentation today.
