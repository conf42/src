1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello, Griffin.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,850
I'm Navin Kumar Beru.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm truly honored to be here
at conference 42 ML 2025.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,920
Today's talk is going to be about
Beyond Perimeters, implementing

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,660
Zero Trust at Enterprise Scale.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,520
In this session, I want to go beyond
the hype and breakdown what Zero Trust

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,180
really means, why it is not just a
security password, but a fundamental

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,050
architectural shift that enterprises
need to survive and thrive in today's

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,910
cloud driven distributed world.

10
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,285
Zero Trust has become one of the
most important strategies for

11
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,245
modern enterprises, especially
those operating across multi-cloud

12
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,965
environments, different geographies,
and supporting remote workforces.

13
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,865
In this presentation, I will walk
you through key concepts, shared

14
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,405
data points, and highlight real world
implementation challenges and outcomes.

15
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,110
Thank you for spending time with me.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,870
Let's get started.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,750
Evolving digital landscape.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,810
Let's begin by painting the
landscape we are operating in today.

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,580
76% of enterprises run multi-cloud
environments spanning across average

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,050
3.7 cloud providers, creating a
highly complex, interconnected system.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,210
Despite investments and tenter
defense, 95% of reaches still result

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,800
from human error, phishing attacks,
misconfigurations accidental exposure.

23
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:16,015
Breach costs are rise class now
averaging around 4.8 million

24
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,035
10.7 increase from last year.

25
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:21,845
These trends show that traditional
perimeter based defenses are

26
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:26,175
no longer enough to effectively
protect modern enterprises.

27
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:30,645
We need a model that assumes breaches
will happen and focus minimizing impact

28
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:32,795
the business case for zero trust.

29
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,445
So why zero trust.

30
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:39,185
Because organizations that embrace
mature zero trust programs save around

31
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:42,335
1.4 million on an average for breach.

32
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:46,565
Adoption has skyrocketed 49% of
enterprise of support, progress,

33
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:51,215
and zero trust initiatives up
from 21% just a few years ago.

34
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,685
This shift is practically driven by
remote work, which has expanded attack

35
00:01:55,685 --> 00:02:00,365
surface by 37%, adding unmanaged devices,
unsecured networks, and external.

36
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,635
Access funds beyond security.

37
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:08,525
Zero Trust offers business benefits like
greater rigidity, safer cloud adoption,

38
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,105
and stronger regulatory alignments.

39
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:15,595
I think it's an essential for
business from perimeter to zero Trust.

40
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,295
Zero trust requests a
fundamental mind shift.

41
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:22,405
Instead of assuming that everything inside
the network is trusted, we follow three

42
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,535
principles, continuous verification.

43
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:26,180
Every request is checked every time.

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,300
Identity based trust.

45
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,140
Gas stations are based on identity,
not on location, no default trust.

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,270
Nothing is implicitly trusted.

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,870
Even inside the network, this
shift matters because 70% of

48
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,290
today's traffic moves from east
west, inside the perimeter.

49
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,480
The old castle and motor approach leaves
too many gaps open with zero trust.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,740
The trust becomes something you
earn, not something you inherit.

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,770
Identity centric security identity is
the heart of zero trust in this model.

52
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,240
Identity becomes a new perimeter, whether
it's a person, device, or a workload.

53
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,350
According to Nest.

54
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,890
All resource authentications and
authorizations are dynamic and strictly

55
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,630
enforced before access is allowed.

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,100
But this is challenging.

57
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,710
92% of enterprises use multiple identity
systems, making it inconsistent and hard.

58
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,970
Implementing leading implementations
now adopt continuous authentications,

59
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,440
checking identity at multiple points
during a session, not just at the login.

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,480
This has resulted in 37% reduction
in identity based compromises

61
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,710
proving the power of strong
identity centered defenses.

62
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,240
In short, identity management becomes
the foundation for all security layers.

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,805
Microsegmentation is another key zero
trust complement rather than managing.

64
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,525
Network zones, you apply granular control.

65
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:49,925
At workload level, 76% of enterprises now
implement software defined segmentation,

66
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,865
which controls ease to best traffic.

67
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:56,615
By ensuring that only explicit
allowed services communicate,

68
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,525
you reduce the breach by 66%.

69
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:03,185
In segmented environments,
microsegmentation effectively limits

70
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:07,115
lateral movement, turning what
could have been a system wide breach

71
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,615
into a small, contained instant.

72
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,335
It reinforces the principle of
least coverage at the network level.

73
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,705
Cutting off attack
pathways before the spread.

74
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:19,975
Contextual access policies, dynamic
access policies are central to zero trust.

75
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:23,365
They rely on combining
multiple factors such as user

76
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,985
identity and behavior patterns.

77
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:30,175
Device health assessed by 83% of
enterprises request context like

78
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,905
locational time data sensitivity.

79
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,480
Ensuring sensitive resources
get extra protection by layering

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,160
this control organizations create
adaptive risk of access decisions.

81
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,920
The result of 37% of infiltrate
exfiltration incidents showing that

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,230
smart policies make a real impact.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,560
This isn't just a static role
based access, but it's a applying

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,955
context over every decision.

85
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:59,535
Again, dynamic policy and enforcement
is central to zero trust implementation.

86
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:04,695
Witness defining a core tenant that
access to resources is determined by

87
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:10,095
dynamic policy, including the observable
state of client identity, application,

88
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,590
service, and requesting asset.

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
The result is that zero
trust, security effect.

90
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,560
Increases in lot of areas, reduction
in exploitable attacks at first by

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,060
41% reduction in breach scope based of
microsegmentation by 66% reduction in data

92
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,790
filtration instance by 37%, and reducing
identity based compromise instance by 37%.

93
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,270
Current state of zero trust adoption.

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,080
Let's look where most
organizations are today.

95
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:43,315
O. Only 8% have fully implemented
zero trust across their enterprises.

96
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,855
But for others, the pro
process is under the way.

97
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:53,365
NI 90, sorry, 49% are actively applying
zero trust and key areas, and 34%

98
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,655
are still planning their approach.

99
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,230
This highlights the implementation
gap between early pilots and

100
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,575
fully enterprise coverage.

101
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,675
Zero trust takes time.

102
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:03,295
It's not a plug and play solution.

103
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:06,745
It requires careful strategy,
phase rollout, and alignment

104
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:07,795
across various teams.

105
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:10,155
Feder identity management.

106
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:14,165
Managing identities across a large,
complex organization is one of the

107
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,145
hardest zero trust challenges, mainly
because identity, confidence gap.

108
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,345
Only 29% of the organizations are
really confident in their identity

109
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:26,455
security controls creating a significant
challenges for zero trust implementations.

110
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,530
Privileged IDENT Identity Management
is 57% of the organizations Report U

111
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,730
using privileged identity management
and solutions as a part of the Zero

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,950
Trust approach machine identity.

113
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,560
73% of the organizations report
managing more machine identities that

114
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,970
humans human identifies, creating an
expanded identity surface requiring

115
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,350
consistent security controls.

116
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,610
Large organizations must, I must
implement, it must implement

117
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,390
federated identity solutions
that provide seamless, yet secure

118
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,550
across distributed environments.

119
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,300
The identity confidence gap
creates significant challenge

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,130
as 89% of organizations have
experienced at least one identity

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
related breach in recent years.

122
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,590
End-to-end encryption, zero.

123
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,530
Trust demands persuasive
encryption, protecting data

124
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,850
no matter where it travels.

125
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,140
This includes encrypting data
transit data trust, securing a PA

126
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,040
communications, protecting EastWest
microservice traffic, and implementing

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,530
robust key management practices.

128
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,540
Zero trust requires encryption to
protect data throughout its life cycle,

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,350
emulating implicit trust in network
boundaries or transport mechanisms.

130
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,870
Research shows encryption is one
of the fourth most common controls

131
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
supporting zero trust initiatives.

132
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,160
This shift reduces reliance on network
boundaries and ensures that even

133
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
intercepted data remains producted.

134
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,780
It's about making sure that data
sensitive information is always secure,

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,335
and even on unru channels distributed
policy enforcement, zero trust requests.

136
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:06,025
Enforcing policies consistently
at multiple levels.

137
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:11,365
Network layer, the secure gateways with
secure gateways and next gen firewalls.

138
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:16,615
57% of organizations imple implement
secure gateways as a part of the zero

139
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:21,985
trust policy proving foundational
security through next generation

140
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:26,355
firewalls and secure access
through SAS E Solutions service.

141
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:30,105
Meh layer using MTLS
and fine game controls.

142
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:35,925
Finding control policy in a containerized
environment enables zero trust principles

143
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,915
to modern application architectures
with service to service communication.

144
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:47,055
Securing the MTLS communication between
each service application layer, applying

145
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:52,305
rules through a PA gateway, address that
all a PA access and others to zero trust

146
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:56,380
policies with comprehensive authentication
or authorization for each request.

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,780
Policy enforcement must occur at
multiple layers within the technology

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,470
stack to implement zero trust principles
effectively at enterprise scale.

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,640
This architectural approach to
policy improvement represents a

150
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,660
critical success factor with 70%
of the organizations reporting

151
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,540
through difficulty and incorporating
consistent policy enforcement

152
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,160
during distributed environments.

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,210
Without uniform policy informants
gaps appear and attackers look

154
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,560
for those inconsistencies.

155
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,010
Effective policy enforcement
is not just about tools.

156
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,890
It's about ensuring alignment
across technology stack.

157
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,950
Comprehensive observability is
true backbone of a successful

158
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,210
zero trust implementation.

159
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,260
Without it, you are operating blind and in
today's fast moving environment, there's

160
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,950
a risk no, no organization can afford.

161
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,340
To succeed, you need a visibility
across entire stack from

162
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,760
infrastructure to application,
from network to user behavior.

163
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,060
This means that you're not just collecting
raw data, but you're turning it into

164
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,700
meaningful insights that can drive action.

165
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,540
Key components include the secure
event collection across all

166
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,370
the systems, cloud and on-prem.

167
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,990
Comprehensive visibility enabling
both proactive threat identification

168
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,730
and effective incident respond.

169
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,840
Respond.

170
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:13,225
Behavioral analysis to establish baseline
studies and quick, quickly identify

171
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:18,055
unusual patterns, establish baseline
behaviors and identify deviations that

172
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:23,885
may indicate security threats of automated
responses that contain threats, the the

173
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:28,045
moment they're detected, enabling rapid
mitigation of potential threats before

174
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,765
they can cause significant damage.

175
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,500
Cons, consistent feedback loops
where real time data helps fine tune

176
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,450
policies and controls over time.

177
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,530
Leverage operational data to
adjust security controls based

178
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,090
on environmental conditions.

179
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,890
Currently, 42% of the organization report
expanding their logging, monitoring and

180
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,480
telemetry efforts as a part of the zero
trust journey, but achieving comprehensive

181
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,610
observability about more than just tools.

182
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,180
It's about designing the systems
that integrate visibility natively

183
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,640
and not an after that a thought.

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,700
Remember, you cannot
secure what you cannot see.

185
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,930
Zero trust requires full situational
awareness across systems,

186
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,880
identities, devices, and networks.

187
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,000
The more you know about the
environment, the faster, the more

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
precise, precisely you can act.

189
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,200
When something goes wrong.

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,005
Ultimately, I done zero trust, zero
trust from a static policy framework

191
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,405
into a living adaptive security posture.

192
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,705
Let's talk about service mis integration.

193
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,420
When we talk about securing cloud
native application service me, service

194
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,820
meshes like Sst o Linkerd or a WS app
mesh become central to zero trust.

195
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,860
They aren't just networking tools.

196
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,340
They're embedded deeply into
how microservice communicate

197
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,750
to communicate with each other.

198
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,560
Serviceness provide critical capabilities
including MTLS, mutual TLS, ensuring that

199
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,100
every service to service inter interaction
is authenticated and encrypted.

200
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,970
All service to service communication
is authenticated and encrypted.

201
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,710
Explicit access policies defining
exactly which services are

202
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,725
allowed to talk to each other.

203
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,180
Can make zero trust, easy to implement.

204
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,170
Services can only communicate with
explicit authorized endpoints.

205
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,860
Telemetry collection is another
in important feature of zero.

206
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,970
Miss Integrion gathering rich
telemetry data on communication

207
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,410
patterns, errors, latency is
critical for telemetric collections.

208
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,280
Detailed metrics on communication patterns
reveals potential security anomalies.

209
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:28,084
Cryptographic workload identities.

210
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:32,810
This gives services unique verifiable
identities that are hard to solve.

211
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,540
Cryptographic identities for services that
can easily, that can't easily be spoofed.

212
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,910
By integrating these features directly
into the application layer, organizations

213
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,435
can, and for zero trust at a granular sub
level, sub service level communications.

214
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,180
This reduces the risk of lateral movement.

215
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,550
Even if one part of the system
is compromised, the other

216
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,410
parts stay minimal impact.

217
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,610
It also provides better visibility
on how applications behave, enabling

218
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,585
tighter controls and faster detection
of anomalies without the service mass.

219
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,920
Mass integration, zero trust efforts
and mic Microsoft microservice

220
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,580
and environments often fall short,
leaving gap for attackers that GA,

221
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,370
that possibly could be exploited.

222
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:18,635
Think of a service mesh as a connective
tissue that holds zero trust principles

223
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,825
and high dynamic cloud architectures.

224
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:24,395
It's not about improving security,
it's about building resilience,

225
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:27,245
scalability, and adaptability
into the heart of the system.

226
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:28,595
Service mesh like.

227
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:34,075
STO, like we talked about, linker, DAWS
mesh facilitate zero trust by providing

228
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:38,275
critical security capabilities for
containerized microservice environment.

229
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:42,330
Service mesh provide critical capabilities
for implementing zero trust and micro

230
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,125
microservice environment by creating
an architecture by securities embedded

231
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,625
within the application infrastructure.

232
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,495
Now let's talk about API
security and zero trust.

233
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:54,225
APIs are front doors to
modern applications and

234
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,140
they're under concentrate.

235
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,440
A zero trust framework, API security must
be treated as a first class citizen and

236
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,270
first class priority, not an afterthought.

237
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,010
Securing API involves several key
practices deploying API gateway as a

238
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,510
centralized centralized enforcement points
for all incoming and outgoing, a PA calls.

239
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,120
This helps in centralized
enforcement points.

240
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:19,365
For applying security policies,
implementing authentication requirements

241
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,545
for all, a PA consumer, regardless
of their network origin, applying

242
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:27,865
rate limit, and anomaly detection
to prevent abuse, denial of service

243
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:30,145
attacks, or unexpected spikes.

244
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,815
Protecting against this
abuse is critical for zero.

245
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:37,275
Forcing schema validation to block
malformed and malicious payloads that

246
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,625
could exploit the backend system.

247
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:42,315
This prevents, this is critical in
preventing controls, ensuring that

248
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:46,305
all data passed through a PA others
to expected format, preventing common

249
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,045
attack techniques like injection attacks.

250
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:51,065
Zero trust for API
becomes, goes even further.

251
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,635
It means authenticating every API
consumer validating authorization

252
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:58,565
for every action and continuously
monitoring for suspicious behaviors.

253
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:02,495
A PA often connect to sensitive
data, financial transactions,

254
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,895
or critical operations, making
them prime target fraud.

255
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:10,235
Attackers without strong API security,
even most well-designed zero trust

256
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,675
architectures can be bypassed.

257
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:16,865
Additionally, as organizations entries
open ecosystems working with partners,

258
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:21,785
vendors, and third parties, API Security
becomes a vital piece of maintaining

259
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:24,065
trust across extended supply chains.

260
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:29,095
Zero Trust can be applied to APIs to
ensure that every single request is

261
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,165
evaluated, verified, and controlled.

262
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:35,335
Ultimately, your zero trust strategy
is only as strong as your weakest

263
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,430
a PA. Now, let's talk about how to
overcome implementation challenge.

264
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,630
We can't talk about zero trust
without addressing its challenges.

265
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,220
Adoption is really smooth
and organizations fail and

266
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,870
face real practical hurdles.

267
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,940
About 60% of security leaders point to
legacy system compatibility as one of the

268
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,965
biggest obstacles for zero trust policy.

269
00:15:56,465 --> 00:16:00,155
Older systems weren't designed for
continuous verification or granular

270
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,845
access control and retrofitting them
can be expensive and time consuming.

271
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:04,735
These.

272
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:09,115
These are also challenges with
other tools like sprawl, skill gaps.

273
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:12,715
There are also challenges with
skill gaps, cultural resistance,

274
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,215
and also alignment across teams.

275
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:19,195
Zero Trust isn't just a security project,
it's a organizational transformation

276
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:22,915
that requires buy-in from leadership,
IP operations, and business units.

277
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:27,895
Successful organizations approach zero
trust as a structured and stage journey.

278
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:32,970
They start by identifying high value
targets, applying zero trust policies.

279
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,580
Where they can and applying zero trust
principles where they can have biggest

280
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,070
impact, and then gradually expanding
the output help build momentum.

281
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,210
But strong, long-term success
requires sustained investment and

282
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,710
cross-functional collaboration.

283
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,460
The transformation of zero trust
architecture presents numerous

284
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,210
implementation challenges that
organizations must systematically address.

285
00:16:56,795 --> 00:17:01,745
Approximately 60% of the security
professional site legacy systems as that

286
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:06,685
main concern by decoupling identity from
network location, implementing rigorous

287
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:10,075
authentication and authorization, and
maintaining continuous verification

288
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:14,995
organization can build resilient security
framework that adapt to realities

289
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,825
of modern distributed enterprises.

290
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,370
It's important to remember that
zero trust isn't a product you

291
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,900
buy your checkbox, you complete.

292
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,410
It's a shift in how organization
thinks about trust, access,

293
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,240
risk, and a mindset that puts
continuous verification at its core.

294
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,460
At the end, the organizations are
that succeed of those that see

295
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,035
zero zero trust as a strategic
commitment, not as a tactical fix.

296
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:44,025
In closing, thank you all so
much for joining me today.

297
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,485
I hope this talk gave you a
clear understanding on how zero

298
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:51,525
trust cancel enterprise security
and give you a realistic sense

299
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,755
of what it takes to get there.

300
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:56,385
If you'd like to connect and share
insights or continue this conversation,

301
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,885
I would love to hear back from you.

302
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,535
Thank you again and enjoy the
rest of conference 42 ml 2025.
