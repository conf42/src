00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,170
Hello everyone and thank you
for joining today's session at

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,090
Con 42 on incident management.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,979
I'm Viji Ma personally, and I bring
with me around two decades of exercise

4
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:13,520
in cloud technologies specializing
in microservices architecture.

5
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:17,689
Over the years, I have had the
privilege of working with various

6
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:22,130
organizations as a hands-on architect
and team lead, have guided teams

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,610
in building and deploying mission
critical microservices applications.

8
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,935
Within agile and cloud environments.

9
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:32,675
Currently I'm working as a tech leader
at Freddie Mac, and today I'll be sharing

10
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:37,205
how the same principles tie into the
evolution of modern A PA gateways and

11
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:41,975
their role in data driven reliability for
microservices and serverless environments.

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,745
Why a PA gateways matter
for the incident management?

13
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,445
Let's start with why.

14
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,155
A PA gateways have evolved from
being simple traffic routers

15
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,715
to becoming critical planes.

16
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:56,305
In fact, they are often the first
responders during the incidents.

17
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:00,865
They give us comprehensive visibility
across distributed services and

18
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:05,715
enabled rapid fault isolation and
allow for target recovery strategies.

19
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:06,915
Think.

20
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:12,075
Of them as the strategic checkpoints,
the place where you can apply resilience

21
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:16,275
patterns consistently without having
to change each service individually.

22
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,395
Let's discuss today's agenda.

23
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:21,325
Here are the things I'll
cover today in this session.

24
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:25,775
The number one, the evolution of
API gateways, and how service mesh

25
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,815
integration strengthens reliability.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,760
Optimizations for serverless workloads and
edge computing as a resilient strategy.

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,900
The fifth one, AI and ML power
routing and caching techniques.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,190
And the final one, security
and zero trust resilience.

29
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,200
By the end of this session, you
will see how modern gateways

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,060
are inges traffic managers.

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,950
There are incident management engines.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,330
Let's jump onto the
evolution of API Gateways.

33
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,570
We'll deep dive into each
of this topic one by one.

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,770
Let's jump onto the
evolution of API gateways.

35
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,350
Let's trace the evolution of
this API gateways during the

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,515
different generations of first.

37
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:05,295
The generation one, the basic proxies.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,525
These gateways just handles the simple
routing and basic authentications

39
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,865
and offer very limited visibility.

40
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:17,165
And the next generation API
management, it added rate limiting

41
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:19,055
analytics and developer portals.

42
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:23,185
This was the start of governance and
in the further generation, the cloud

43
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:27,295
native, which is the Kubernetes native
service, mesh integrator, and much

44
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:29,545
better at scaling with microservices.

45
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:34,395
The final generation, the reliability
engine, this is a big leap, a driven

46
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:39,645
re resilience and predictive scaling,
and even autonomous recovery.

47
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:45,105
Today, the modern gateways can process
one 80 million a p calls daily across

48
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:49,875
eight 50 plus microservices, keeping
latency under 50 milliseconds, and

49
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,895
uptime at 99.99 percentage even
during the incident conditions.

50
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:58,415
Let's check into the second
topic, service mesh integration.

51
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:02,665
Next, let's talk about the service
mesh integration, which I call

52
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,135
the relatable team multiplier.

53
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:09,555
When paid with an API Gateway service
mesh delivers a lot of great features.

54
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:13,455
Something like below, which is like
62% faster in insulin detection,

55
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,520
34% lower end-to-end latency.

56
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:22,695
And 57% better resource efficiency,
78% more accurate and fault isolation.

57
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,275
Together they form a
resilient control plane.

58
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:28,185
We get real time traffic,
shaping intelligence, circuit

59
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:31,885
braking, and observability,
all in one co one ecosystem.

60
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,745
Let's jump onto a real world
example, which comes from the

61
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,155
financial services sector.

62
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:40,265
Which coordinates eight 50
plus microservices through

63
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,645
a single gateway cluster.

64
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:47,915
The setup processed one 80 million daily
calls, kept LA at 47 milliseconds, and cut

65
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:51,305
MTTR from 23 minutes down to 4.3 minutes.

66
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,975
That's a game changer
for incident management.

67
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:57,265
Let's move on to the
serverless optimization.

68
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,160
Now let's move into the serverless.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,500
Which brings unique challenges.

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,170
Some of them are something like
this, like cold start mitigation

71
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,620
by using pre warming strategies.

72
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,010
We have seen a 76% reduction in cold
strats maintaining 88 milliseconds, warm

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,990
starts even during instant recovery.

74
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,530
Scaling precision predictive
scaling has reached 99.995.

75
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,860
Percentage accuracy enables us
to handle 42 million monthly

76
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,080
events without over provisioning.

77
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,650
And finally, the request izing with
intelligent batching, we cut down 43%

78
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,200
of functional invocations during spikes.

79
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,650
The takeaways, API Gateways help
serverless workloads stay fast.

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,000
Coefficient.

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,350
And reliable.

82
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,460
Let's move on to edge
computing for resilience.

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,020
Under another powerful
lever is edge computing.

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,560
Deploying gateways at Edge provides 58%
reduction in global latency support for

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,580
98,000 requests per second, across 40 to
global locations, and 99.95 percentage

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,260
of time during the regional outages.

87
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:08,815
73% reduction in cross region traffic.

88
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:14,535
An example of a edge deployment
architecture looks like this, and

89
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:18,975
which has several key things which
are like regional API Edge, which are

90
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,025
like local gateway notes, handling
user traffic and a control plane,

91
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:27,015
which has a central configuration and
routing policies, and then an active

92
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,445
routing, which does load balanced.

93
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,635
Health aware traffic screening.

94
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,655
Finally, the failover paths,
which does automatic automated

95
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,335
fallback to healthy regions.

96
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,525
In practice, this multi region
architecture allowed one E-Commerce

97
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:45,905
customer survived a major US East
one outage by rerouting traffic

98
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:50,375
automatically to healthy regions,
maintaining 99.98% availability.

99
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:52,655
This is resilience in action.

100
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:56,260
Failures are contained regionally
while customers stay online.

101
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,925
And move on to the next topic, which is
AI and ML capabilities with API Gateways,

102
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:10,335
AI powered routing gateways make nine,
950,000 routing decisions per minute with

103
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:13,725
99.95 percentage optimal path accuracy.

104
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,895
This directly speeds up
incident resolution by 38%.

105
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:22,745
An ML driven caching by analyzing
request patterns, data volatility, and

106
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:28,945
traffic fix, we achieve up to 47% back
and load reduction during the incidents.

107
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,915
The benefit is clear here.

108
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:35,655
Instead of engineered, scrambling to
scale systems under pressure, AI and MI

109
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:40,865
allow the system itself to absorb the
stress while teams focus on the recovery.

110
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:46,015
Let's jump on to another topic,
which is zero trust security,

111
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:50,495
During the incidents, let's not
forget security re resilience.

112
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,965
During the peak loads, gateways can
process 1.9 million authentication

113
00:06:54,965 --> 00:07:00,395
requests per minute with an average
16 milliseconds response time while

114
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,970
maintaining 99.99% compliance.

115
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,690
How.

116
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,300
To distributor token validation,
local policy enforcement, and graceful

117
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,040
degradation, even when identity providers
or restructured security remains intact.

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,520
These that during incidents, we are not
trading off availability for complaints.

119
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,960
We are maintaining both.

120
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,465
Let's discuss implementing
resilient gateway architectures.

121
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,905
So how do we do this altogether?

122
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,215
There are several key
factors to achieve this.

123
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:32,125
One, a clear ownership and
boundaries define what the

124
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,105
gateway forms versus the services.

125
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,185
And second, the multi-layer
observability, which we have to

126
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,015
do the tracing metrics and probes.

127
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:44,635
Failure, isolation patterns,
which are like circuit breakers,

128
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:46,045
bulk hurts, and rate limits.

129
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:51,685
And automated remediation build
self-healing with fallback behaviors.

130
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,395
And finally, the instant playbooks.

131
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,230
Clear Runbooks for
gateway specific failures.

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,310
This isn't just about the tech, it's about
the operational discipline and readiness.

133
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,630
So the final key takeaways from
this session, a PA gateways

134
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,890
are no longer just routers.

135
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,290
They are critical incident
management control plans, service

136
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,070
mesh integration cards, incidents
detection time by over 60%.

137
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,495
Edge deployments maintain near a hundred
percent of time during the outages.

138
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:25,605
A powered routing and ML caching deliver
fast recovery and efficiency gains.

139
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:26,745
Zero.

140
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:30,045
Trust, resilience, and
ensure security is never com

141
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,965
compromised during the incidents.

142
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:37,195
I hope I covered all the topics which I
intended to cover during this session.

143
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,515
Thank you all for listening.

144
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:43,105
I hope this gives you a clear picture of
how modern API gateways are becoming the

145
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,295
backbone of reliable cloud native systems.

146
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:46,485
Thank you.

147
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,375
I would love to connect further.

148
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:51,985
Here is my LinkedIn link
if anyone want to connect.

149
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,725
Thank you once again.
