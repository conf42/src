1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,270
Hey everyone, thank you
for joining me today.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,390
So today we're going to talk
about something exciting.

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,360
How cloud native analytics is
revolutionizing the way we use big data

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,409
to drive real time product insights.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,789
So in this session, we'll explore
why traditional analytics fall short,

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,969
how cloud native approaches make a
difference, and how this transformation

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,409
can drive business success.

8
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:23,880
So let's dive in.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,860
So now that we've set the stage,
let's take a quick look at

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,390
what we'll be covering today.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,250
So we'll start by discussing
the Big Data Challenge.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,400
as in why businesses struggle
with traditional analytics.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,650
Then we'll define cloud native analytics
and how it enables real time insights.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,080
Next, we'll explore why real time
analytics matters, followed by the key

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,209
technologies that make it possible.

16
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:54,019
Then I'll share a real world example of
Uber, showing how they use cloud native

17
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,869
analytics to drive business success.

18
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,219
Then we'll go through an implementation
roadmap for businesses, outlining

19
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,489
the steps to get started.

20
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,979
We'll also touch on challenges
and considerations, because no

21
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,889
transformation is without obstacles.

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,169
Finally, we'll wrap up by
looking at future trends and

23
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,459
summarizing the key takeaways.

24
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,409
So we are in an era where data is being
generated at an unimaginable scale.

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,184
Every day, businesses, devices,
and users generate about 328

26
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,574
million terabytes of data.

27
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,084
What's the challenge?

28
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:32,364
Traditional analytics and their systems
weren't designed for the speed of volume.

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,954
They often rely on batch processing,
meaning decisions are based on

30
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,074
historical rather than real time data.

31
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:43,444
So this gap between data
generation and actionable insights

32
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:46,124
creates a real business problem.

33
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:48,754
And that's delayed decision making.

34
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:52,214
Missed opportunities and inefficiencies.

35
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,934
So cloud native analytics
is a game changer.

36
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:59,534
Unlike traditional systems that struggle
with scaling, cloud native solutions

37
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:04,224
are designed from the ground up to
handle massive, dynamic workloads.

38
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:11,234
They leverage serverless computing,
meaning you and only you use resources

39
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,754
when needed, making it cost effective.

40
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:18,034
They use containers and microservices,
making them modular and scalable.

41
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:23,634
And most importantly, they enable real
time streaming analytics, allowing

42
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:29,084
businesses to act on data instantly
rather than waiting hours or even days.

43
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,094
So why does real time
analytics matter so much?

44
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:35,552
Because in today's world, being
fast is being competitive.

45
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,044
Take Netflix or Spotify.

46
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:42,124
Real time analytics drive their
personalized recommendations.

47
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,424
And think about fraud detection.

48
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:48,004
Banks need to act on suspicious
transactions immediately,

49
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:49,714
and not hours later.

50
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:52,154
Even product teams benefit from this.

51
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:56,624
So companies using real time insights
can tweak and improve their offerings

52
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,604
based on live user feedback.

53
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,994
So to make real time analytics
possible, we need the right

54
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:03,294
technology stack firstly.

55
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:08,964
That's number one, event streaming
tools like Kafka or AWS Kinesis.

56
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,685
are able to process massive
amounts of live data.

57
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:16,755
Number two, serverless computing
ensures resources scale automatically,

58
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:19,684
which optimizes cost and performance.

59
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:24,025
Number three is data lakes and
warehouses, which act as the foundation

60
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,895
storing vast amounts of data, which is
structured or could be unstructured.

61
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:34,400
And number four is AI and ML. And they
really supercharge analytics by turning

62
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,300
raw data into predictive insights.

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,350
So whether it's forecasting
demand, identifying risks, or

64
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,990
personalizing experiences, AI
and ML are where you look at.

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,970
So now let's take a look at Uber.

66
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,130
I think this is a perfect example
of real time analytics in action.

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,730
Uber doesn't just use static pricing.

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,980
Instead, they analyze demand in real time.

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,670
And if a major event occurs
Ends and demand quickly spikes.

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,760
Uber's analytics engine instantly adjusts
pricing to balance supply and demand.

71
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,080
They use Kafka to stream millions
of riot requests per second and

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,300
Flink to process them in real time.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Finally, they use Databricks
for deeper insights.

74
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,090
And what's the result?

75
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,220
Smarter driver allocation, reduced
wait times, and optimized pricing.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,110
This is all thanks to
cloud native analytics.

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,140
So how can businesses actually implement
real time analytics in a practical sense?

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,720
This is not about ripping
and replacing old systems.

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,510
It's about strategically modernizing.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,440
Step one is to identify where
your data is coming from.

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,230
Customer interactions, IoT devices,
transaction logs are just a few sources.

82
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,910
But there could be many more.

83
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,390
Step two.

84
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,535
Step two is implement real time
ingestion tools like Kafka or Kinesis.

85
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:01,645
Step three is to store data in
a scalable cloud data lake, so

86
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,745
no more rigid databases anymore.

87
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:09,595
Step four is to use serverless computing
and AI to process this data efficiently.

88
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:14,335
And step five is to surface insights
through real time dashboards and

89
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:17,035
alerts, so teams can act immediately.

90
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,455
Now, of course, no transformation
is without challenges.

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,030
So what are the top challenges we can see?

92
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,270
Number one is latency issues can arise
if data pipelines aren't well optimized.

93
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,840
Number two is cost management
can be very critical.

94
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,150
So real time analytics can be expensive
if not, architectured efficiently.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,810
And number three is data security and
compliance could be a big concern,

96
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,450
especially in highly regulated industries
like banking, finance, and healthcare.

97
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,760
But with careful planning, businesses can
navigate these challenges effectively.

98
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,450
So looking ahead, we're going to see even
more innovation in real time analytics.

99
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,490
Edge computing will push real time
analytics closer to the source, whether

100
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,130
it's through IoT devices or smart sensors.

101
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,870
AI driven automation will further
reduce human intervention, and this will

102
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,520
enable fully autonomous decision making.

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,470
And multi cloud strategies
will become the norm.

104
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,055
Allowing businesses to be more
resilient and avoid vendor lock in.

105
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:22,535
So to wrap up, cloud native analytics
isn't just a buzzword, it's a necessity

106
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:24,105
for businesses looking to stay ahead.

107
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,685
Organizations that embrace real time
insights will outpace competitors,

108
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:33,005
optimize their operations, and
deliver superior customer experiences.

109
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:37,765
Now it's the time to invest in
the right technologies and start

110
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,965
your real time transformation.

111
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,115
That's my time.

112
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:40,605
Thank you.
