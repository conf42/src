00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,570
Hello, my name is Paweł Skrzypek, and
today I would like to present some update

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:13,059
regarding the Nebulus meta operating
system for the cloud computing continuous.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,860
What is it, how it works, and who is
using that, and with what results.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,540
My name is Paweł Skrzypek,
I'm a cloud architect, and I'm

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,229
participating in this project.

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,199
short again, short agenda.

7
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,389
I will start with the description of
what is the cloud continuum and why

8
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,789
we are using this cloud continuum.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,339
Probably most of us is using it
currently, even without using

10
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,269
the name of the cloud continuum.

11
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:50,360
I will tell a little bit more
what is meta operating system.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,300
That could be quite new approach for
the building Cloud systems, and then

13
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,593
I will provide information and update
regarding the Nebulas project, what it

14
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:09,670
is, what is the purpose and how to use,
the project, and finally, I will show the

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,789
use case application on Fallows fund, AI
based investments funds, which is using

16
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,130
cloud continuum to do the, algorithmic.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,960
based, investments.

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,150
So that's a very short, agenda.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,090
Let's start.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,610
I will start with some definition.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,230
Yeah.

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,130
What is the cloud continuum?

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,149
And, I think the best definition is
that cloud, cloud continuum is simply

24
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:40,059
the extension of the traditional
clouds to cover the multiple

25
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,089
entities, which provide analysis.

26
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:46,514
Processing, storage, and
data generation capabilities.

27
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,724
And in fact, many more things, especially
running the components and so on.

28
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:56,114
And what constitutes this cloud continue?

29
00:01:56,674 --> 00:02:00,674
the most important elements are
obviously public clouds or generally

30
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:07,044
speaking clouds, Fog, IOT devices,
which are connected to the clouds.

31
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:11,474
data centers and private clouds
'cause some of the application are

32
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:17,254
still running and, probably will be
running in the private data centers.

33
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:24,464
Private clouds, edge sites, multi access
edge computing, so multiple small, smaller

34
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:27,684
data centers, located near the users.

35
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:33,304
And the same for the, micro data centers,
which allow to, to deliver the computing.

36
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,274
It is closer to the users.

37
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:43,704
So to minimize the . So all of that could
conti co constitute the cloud continuum.

38
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:48,914
obviously there are multiple other
models like multi clouds, which

39
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,019
means the usage of two or more.

40
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:57,024
public clouds, hybrid clouds, the mixed
usage of the public clouds and non

41
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:00,914
public private cloud and cloud continuum.

42
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,604
You can imagine as it's a mix
and match all of these models

43
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,914
across of whole continuum.

44
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:13,419
So that's the reason that the
name is the Cloud Continuum and

45
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,589
why we need the Cloud Continuum.

46
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:22,379
As I already said, most of the application
of modern application currently using the

47
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:28,469
Cloud Continuum, for example, all of the
application deployed to the smartphone

48
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:34,009
or smartwatches or other devices
are using the Continuum because the

49
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,469
computation is usually done in the cloud.

50
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,839
But the data gathering data.

51
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:43,039
input and output is done on the
application on the smartphone and

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,349
smartwatch also with the current,
computing capabilities of the devices.

53
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,879
Some of the processing is done also
on, on devices, but the most and.

54
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,419
most heavy processing, is done
in the cloud or private cloud.

55
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,869
And using the Cloud Continuum, we can
optimize usage, the application, and

56
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:14,489
achieve the best possible experience
and utilization of available resources.

57
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:19,329
Because we can minimize the latency,
especially the latency to the user.

58
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,579
We can optimize the usage of the resources
and we also can benefit, on the, devices

59
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:33,484
with the power and computing power
of the big data center or big cloud.

60
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:39,124
One more definition, the last
one is the meta operating system.

61
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:44,954
Meta operating system in our case
is the operating system which

62
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:52,571
extends beyond the one server or
One cluster and is shared across the

63
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,203
multiple, devices across the clouds.

64
00:04:55,203 --> 00:05:02,572
That's the reason that we, use that
name because the idea behind the Nebulas

65
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:08,562
project is to deliver meta operating
system for the cloud continuum.

66
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:12,382
It is also the name of the
project funded by European

67
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:15,402
Union in Horizon Europe program.

68
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:21,962
So it's a research project and it aims to
deliver that kind of the meta operating

69
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:25,232
system for cloud computing continuous.

70
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:32,462
the consortium consists of multiple
research organizations, industry,

71
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:39,382
companies, as well as the end users of
the application, which, provide the use

72
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:44,982
case application to test the project
and to check, Capabilities of the meta

73
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:48,002
operating system in real life application.

74
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:52,182
I will tell today a little bit
more about the one application

75
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,092
delivered by Onfalos Fund.

76
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,252
what Nebulus is doing?

77
00:05:56,752 --> 00:06:02,502
The first thing is, To develop the
appropriate modeling methods, which allows

78
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:07,822
for describing the cloud continuum, as
you already know, the cloud continuum

79
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:12,862
contains multiple type of the clouds,
devices, data centers, and so on.

80
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:18,382
So we need a unified method to
describe this cloud continuum to

81
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,722
provide the application requirements.

82
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,682
to be able to describe and
modeling the application

83
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,342
requirements for the different.

84
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:32,502
different types of the resources and
also to model the data streams, so how

85
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:35,172
to use and connect the data streams.

86
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:39,712
Obviously, everything should
assure the quality of service of

87
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,172
the provisioned service services.

88
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:43,542
And then.

89
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:49,817
Nebulus delivers the optimizers, so
ability to compare different available

90
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:55,767
offerings in the cloud continuum and
using the multi criteria decision making

91
00:06:55,887 --> 00:07:02,007
methods to select the most optimal set of
the resources for the given application

92
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:07,647
and to continuously reconfigure the
application in the cloud continuum.

93
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:13,557
to achieve the best possible efficiency
of the use of the application.

94
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:18,407
Nobles also covered the security,
because the security aspect is

95
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:23,697
critical for the cloud continuum,
and also introduced the novel smart

96
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,947
contract based service level agreement.

97
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:31,992
Yeah, because as we can see in the cloud
continuum, we have multiple, service

98
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:37,752
providers, public clouds, private
cloud, telecom provider with the private

99
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:44,572
data center, Mets, location and also
the communication and other things.

100
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:47,722
And we also have the IOT devices.

101
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:53,282
So the, security and some kind of
the service level agreement is.

102
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:58,572
critical, to achieve the expected
efficiency of the application

103
00:07:58,582 --> 00:07:59,962
in the cloud continuum.

104
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,952
How Nebulus is built.

105
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,882
As you can see, that's a very
general overview of the high

106
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:09,802
level architecture of the Nebulus.

107
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:13,572
That's the critical elements,
core of the Nebulus.

108
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:18,132
And here is the execution
layer of the Nebulus.

109
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,822
Nebulus is based fully on
the Kubernetes cluster.

110
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:26,992
So the idea of the Nebulus is to
deploy application to the various

111
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,752
Kubernetes cluster, which are.

112
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,757
It could be located in the different
location, it could be the public cloud,

113
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:39,457
it could be the private data center,
and it could be the MEC location.

114
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:45,427
And Nebulas is able to optimize the
usage of the resources of these clusters.

115
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:52,467
and to deliver and deploy automatically
application to the given clusters, then

116
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:58,657
to fetch the metrics, so the measurements,
how application is working, what is

117
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:03,087
the quality of the service, what is
the response to the user, what is the

118
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:08,347
processing capabilities, and based on
that reconfigure application if needed.

119
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:15,362
to improve the so called utility function,
goal function, which measures, the

120
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,242
efficiency of the application deployment.

121
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:23,062
More information about the Nebulas
architecture and features is

122
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,612
provided on the Nebulas website.

123
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:29,527
There are multiple technical reports
with the detailed description.

124
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,607
so please, visit and review.

125
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:38,887
if you are interested in using Nebulus,
Nebulus is fully open source, based

126
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,937
on the Mozilla Public License 2.

127
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:49,427
0, so it could be downloaded and used, for
any purposes without any additional costs.

128
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,957
But Nebulus is not only
about the producing software.

129
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:57,317
Nebulus project also offers
the open access research.

130
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:02,107
There are multiple excellent
research papers in the field

131
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:07,487
of the cloud continuum, cloud
optimization, and deployment.

132
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:13,617
we are also focusing on the cloud
continuum dissemination and education.

133
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:18,927
training and last but not
least is the open calls.

134
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:26,117
In the Nebulas project we have two
runs of the open calls in total is 1.

135
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:34,597
35 million euro fund available for
the for nine grants for the nine

136
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:42,726
outside of the consortium companies and
organization who wants to use the Nebulus.

137
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:48,787
The first round of the
OpenCourse was launched in 2024.

138
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:51,837
content is just open for submission.

139
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,177
you can find the link here.

140
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:59,927
So if you have the application,
which is using the cloud continuum,

141
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,857
and you would like to try Nebulus,
it's the best way, because, the,

142
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:09,727
adaptation of the application to the
Nebulus could be found that in the.

143
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:11,957
open course projects.

144
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:15,657
So we are looking for
that, good application.

145
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:20,407
It must be the existing application,
which is using the cloud continuum

146
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,507
and wants to deploy on the nebulous.

147
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:30,267
And that's generally the aim of the
Nebulus projects, to, accomplish the

148
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:34,352
research contribution, especially
in the realms of the cloud, Fog,

149
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:39,602
and Edge procuring, and to develop
the advanced methods and tools

150
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:45,082
which enable secure and optimal
application deployment to the cloud.

151
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:46,352
continue.

152
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:53,652
so that was about the Nebulus and here
we have the use case application and the

153
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,222
use case application is Onfalos Fund.

154
00:11:56,322 --> 00:12:00,882
It is the alternative investment
funds registered in Luxembourg

155
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:06,482
and the uniqueness of the Onfalos
Fund is that it's fully operated.

156
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:11,052
by, automatically by AI
algorithms, which, control the

157
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,408
risk and manage the investments.

158
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:19,025
Onfalos Fund is operating
since January, 2022.

159
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,945
So it's over three years of the life.

160
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,970
track record, audited, and Onfalos
fund uses cloud continuum to maximize

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,605
the efficiency of, its investments.

162
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:36,735
the most of the computing power is
located in the cloud, in the cloud.

163
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:42,795
ONOS fund is using two clouds, AWS and
Ner, so it's a multi-cloud configuration.

164
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:49,075
also, ONOS fund is using the private
data center, so it's quite complex

165
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:53,605
infrastructure and it's directly
connected to the broker, so it could

166
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,895
be considered as the, connections.

167
00:12:56,395 --> 00:13:01,071
and here we can see the results
of the Onfalos Fund in the period

168
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,579
since January 2022 till now.

00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:12,209
so as you can see, Onfalos Fund,
outperforms all benchmarks, yeah, even

170
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:19,494
the NASDAQ S& P 500 with the great
strong up run in the last period,

171
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:26,674
in the longer term that the AI based
investments is just more reliable and

172
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,364

173
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:34,978

of the Onthalos is 3 percent and

174
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:40,254

over 30%, assuming start in the,
