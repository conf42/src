1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,990
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,330
Welcome to conference 42,
platform Engineering 2025.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,270
This is LaMi.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,100
I bring over 20 plus years of
experience in building enterprise

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,360
data lakes and enterprise data
analytics platforms across both on pre.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,000
Cloud environments.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,910
Today's talk is focusing on beyond
manual firefighting, building,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,580
self feeling data pipelines with
AI for platform engineering.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,769
Platform engineers today face
unprecedented operational

10
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,129
challenges because of exponential.

11
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:48,504
Growth of data and exponential growth of
data pipelines across the enterprises.

12
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:54,055
Every transaction or user interaction
generates a lot of data that

13
00:00:54,055 --> 00:01:00,355
has to be ingested, transformed,
validated and provide and available

14
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:02,244
to data analytics platform.

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,690
Even though we have most advancements
in orchestration frameworks and cloud

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,410
native platforms, pipeline failures
remains one of the persistent pain point

17
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:18,410
across all the production environments.

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,130
In the next slide, we talk
about current challenges.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,230
Engineers spend mata of the
time debugging the failures.

20
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:31,855
Fixing the broken data pipelines
manually restoring service continuity.

21
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:38,215
This talk explores transformative to
potential of VA A driven self-healing

22
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:42,535
data pipelines by leveraging
anomaly detection, root cause

23
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,815
analysis, autonomous remediation.

24
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:51,725
So that enterprises can move from
react to firefighting, to ProAct

25
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,395
to eventually autonomous operation.

26
00:01:54,895 --> 00:02:03,775
In this talk, we'll be focusing on three
use cases across retail sector and health,

27
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:06,340
healthcare domain, as well as financial.

28
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:12,000
Domain and also we talk practical
implementation strategies.

29
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:16,979
What are the factors to be considered
for governance, and what would be

30
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,930
the measurable written investment?

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,169
Adapting, yay a in platform engineering.

32
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,169
The introduction, we talk here.

33
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:32,174
The modern enterprises all defined by
data, every strategic decision, customer

34
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:39,255
experience, complaints reports all depends
upon seamless data flow from source system

35
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,435
to analytical platforms and dashboards.

36
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:48,974
To handle this demand platform, engineers
has to design complex data pipelines

37
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:54,214
that operates with high reliability due
to the complexity of these pipelines.

38
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:01,489
Say small schema mismatch, our network
outage configuration transformation,

39
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:08,089
breaking the enter downstream
workflow, which impacts losing the

40
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:13,249
revenues, opportunities, compliance
violation, and violation, and delayed

41
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:15,629
insights of the decision making.

42
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,429
In this slide, we are going to
talk how the current traditional

43
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,630
monitoring is working.

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:27,660
The traditional monitoring system
notifies users when something fails

45
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,450
and remediation is almost manual.

46
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:37,200
As of today, 60% of platform engineers
operational bandwidth will go.

47
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:44,489
Troubleshooting and recovering the
job and the amount of jobs or data

48
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,090
pipelines or interconnected jobs.

49
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,490
The probability of at least one
failure daily is near certain, so by.

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,450
Seeing all these failures, utilization
of Yaya power, self-healing data

51
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,360
pipelines makes a paradigm shift.

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,430
Instead, engineers reacting to the
failures, pipelines can autonomously

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,320
detect the anomalies, diagnose the root
cause, and take the character action.

54
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,830
By doing that, the role
of engineers now become.

55
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,150
Firefighters to supervisor focusing on
the governance, auditing, and improving

56
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,010
intelligence of these autonomous systems.

57
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,520
So the current, what is
the burden of this manual?

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,820
Troubleshooting is for the, any
enterprise is cost association because any

59
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,405
downtime of critical pipeline in retail
organization delay the inventory updates.

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,670
Across the thousands of stores, whereas
in the case of financial services,

61
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,180
broken fraud detection pipeline can lose
millions of dollars for that institute.

62
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,850
In this slide, we are going to
talk about the key challenges

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,770
of manual pipeline management.

64
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,810
The manual process has
highly failure frequency.

65
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:09,975
Because of hundreds of interconnected
jobs interconnected jobs and also failure

66
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:16,155
of one job can impact downstreams and
difficult to stress the root cause

67
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:21,815
and locks are often augmented across
the systems, requires engineers to

68
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,945
stitch together and close manually.

69
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:30,335
This, the, this situation is not
sustainable for data ecosystems.

70
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:35,815
So the promise of AA in self
filling data pipelines decides on

71
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,705
these following four capabilities.

72
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,685
One is anomaly detection.

73
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:44,725
This indicates algorithms
continuously analyze the matrix logs.

74
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:48,535
Data quality checks do
detect any abnormal behavior.

75
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:52,035
You by using trans
transformer based models.

76
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,560
That demonstrated exceeding 90%
in identifying the anomalies.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,910
The second one, root, the second
capability, root cause analysis.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,270
With the utilization of natural language
models, GPT-4, we can analyze the logs,

79
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,090
trace the dependency graphs, identify the.

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,150
Most probable root cause with
the minimal human impact.

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,880
The third capability, autonomous
remediation once the cause is identified.

82
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,150
Reinforcement learning
agents are rule-based.

83
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,030
Automation trigger can
take the character actions.

84
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,390
Continuous learning is by learning
from previous spoilers, successful

85
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,490
remediation and human feedback.

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,640
This is one of the case study in the
retail sector where the global retail

87
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:49,280
sector, our company managing two
terabytes of data ingesting from source

88
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,950
to target is facing frequent data
pipeline failures because of s screamer

89
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,100
changes or high volume traffic spikes.

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,700
The manual process often took
covers leading avail, leading

91
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,590
to delayed product availability
on e-commerce platform with ai.

92
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,470
The k 99% of time across critical
data pipelines are achieved and

93
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,430
anomaly detection with 94% accuracy
is identifying schema mismatches, ude,

94
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,470
and automated recovery of workflows
from two hours to five minutes.

95
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:32,075
As achieved, as well as operational
cost, estimated from a million

96
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,145
dollars to reduced downtime.

97
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:40,375
In the healthcare, another case study
in the healthcare sector, the IT uses

98
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:44,155
GPT-4 to automatically pass the locks.

99
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:49,255
Identify the failure, authentication,
or misconfiguration policies

100
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,625
with autonomous remediation.

101
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,400
We can isolate the failing notes,
rerouting the data, and hand over it to

102
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,400
the engineers to review the EA actions
to take care of high risk scenarios.

103
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,625
So the results were for profound.

104
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:10,074
The recovery times are dropped by 70%.

105
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:16,495
Complaints, audits conformed, all a
driven actions were logged and auditable.

106
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:20,715
Another case study that conducted
was in the FinTech company.

107
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:25,544
In the FinTech sector, real
time fraud detection demands

108
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,344
subsecond responsiveness.

109
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:32,924
The leading tech form faces the
challenges when even where even shortages

110
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:39,230
could explore platform to fraudulent
transaction with AA data driven.

111
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,330
Self feeling.

112
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,650
Data pipelines are reinforcement
learning agents, dynamic resource

113
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,469
allocation as and when the volume is
more immediately allocating more compute

114
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:55,014
resources to fraud detection models.

115
00:08:55,514 --> 00:09:01,844
So that it's automatically
identifying frauds in subsecond,

116
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:04,694
responsiveness and automated failure.

117
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:10,724
One is automatically all the automated
failures to backup pipelines without

118
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:15,704
human intervention and recovery
times are dropped from subsecond

119
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:18,194
levels ensuring uninterrupted.

120
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:19,639
Fraud detection.

121
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,639
So the adoption of self-healing pipelines
will help not only reducing the fraud

122
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,399
risk and also reassuring regulators and
customers of the platforms reliability.

123
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,559
So the whole technical foundation
of the self filling pipelines

124
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,279
relies on detect, analyze, optimize.

125
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,319
So the transform transformer based
anomaly detection, identifies

126
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,119
time series matrix log anomaly
detection natural language models,

127
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,279
identifies the root cause analysis.

128
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,229
Reinforcement learning agents
will use resource optimization

129
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:58,239
agent continuously learn.

130
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:03,789
Optimal policies for scaling
routing resource allocation, the

131
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,319
how the enterprises can implement
these self filling data pipelines.

132
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,474
The architecture patterns
will be three ways.

133
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:16,074
One is centralized a layer, other
one is decentralized embedded agents.

134
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,234
Third one is hybrid models.

135
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:22,784
So the governance and trust plays
a critical role whenever any

136
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:26,024
organization enterprise adapts ai.

137
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:27,734
So the, so if.

138
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:34,519
The that the self feeling data
pipelines, make sure it is compatible

139
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,939
for editability, which means every
variation has logged with explanation

140
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:46,759
and industry specific regulations as
followed in the compliance framework.

141
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,339
Human AI collaboration engineers
should remain supervisory roles,

142
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,949
reviewing high impact remediation.

143
00:10:54,489 --> 00:11:00,849
These autonomous systems operate within
guardrails of gain trust, so building this

144
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:07,984
trust in self-healing system any requires
transparency, continuous monitoring and

145
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:10,264
cultural change within organization.

146
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:18,674
So the role, the information business
impact when any organization implements

147
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:25,394
the self filling data pipelines, what we
saw here is the downtime reduction was

148
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:31,174
approximately a. Very reduced on term
reduction was 99% are achievable and

149
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:38,314
there is huge number of dollars are saved
in terms of handling the volume spikes

150
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:45,184
as well as routing the failure data to
different node and avail and making sure

151
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:48,184
platform is available for all the time.

152
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:54,514
And the team got a productivity
gain of 70% because of.

153
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:00,404
Automatically rev running the
data pipelines for any failures.

154
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:05,684
So the benefit of self-healing
pipelines extends beyond technical

155
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:11,384
resilience, customer satisfaction
with faster, more reliable services.

156
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:18,154
The retina investment often calculated,
comparing the avoided downtime,

157
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:24,614
cost, reducing fraud exposure, and
engineering hours saved the, so the

158
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,324
future of self-healing pipelines.

159
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:30,674
As the data grows, enterprise
data pipelines grows.

160
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:37,589
With the utilizing this a power cell
feeling pipelines, it'll be battle

161
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:44,009
tested solution, and that is already
transforming in retail healthcare finance.

162
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,449
So by adapting anomaly detection,
natural language return, root

163
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:53,339
cause analysis, reinforcement
learning, our continuous learning

164
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,574
organizations can achieve unprecedented
reliability, compliance efficiency.

165
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,234
That's all for that today's talk.

166
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,164
Thank you.

167
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:03,784
I.
