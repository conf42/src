1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,770
Hello, good day.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,339
My name is Victor Onyenagubom and
today I'll be talking about people

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,785
power security, the role of sub
skills in a DevSecOps culture.

4
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:14,405
There's a lot of focus today around
technical skills and, but not a lot of,

5
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:19,865
there's not a lot of discussion around the
role that sub skills could play to improve

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,784
the security culture of an organization.

7
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,765
So looking at how sub skills like
communication, like empathy, like

8
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:30,494
collaboration, like relationship
building can actually improve security

9
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,255
awareness within an organization.

10
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,355
And this has to do with people.

11
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:34,425
Thank you.

12
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:38,114
So First of all, we need to
understand that, there's a gap

13
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,644
in the cyber security landscape.

14
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:43,904
every day there are increase in
the type of cyber security threats.

15
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:47,855
the threats are evolving and
organizations need to stay vigilant.

16
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:48,635
Okay.

17
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:52,795
And since these threats are becoming
more and more complex, it's important

18
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:56,804
for organizations to rethink
the way they see cyber threats.

19
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:02,124
And in terms of in that interdisciplinary
approach, there needs to be a mix of.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,630
Technical sub skills in solving
these challenges, right?

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,690
We've seen the rise of social
engineering attacks that does

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,150
not just rely on technical
expertise, but also people, right?

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,850
To hack somebody, right?

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,750
To hack people based on their
emotions and take advantage of them.

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,470
So there needs to be like, A combined
approach as regards solving cybersecurity

26
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,780
issues in the world we live in today.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,650
So, how can we empower human element?

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,370
What are the importance of soft skills?

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,070
Why am I even talking about soft skills?

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,900
Is it important?

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,100
Why not?

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,110
Why should we not just focus on
the technical skills after all?

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,470
That is, isn't that what is always needed?

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,260
But we would see that soft
skills are like very important.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,269
For instance, effective communication
is very crucial to the world.

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,960
Because if you are a cyber security
analyst, for instance, and you have to

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,119
give a presentation to the C level, maybe
to the CFO, to the CIO, to the CEO, they

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,359
may not be very technical people, and
you need to have effective communication

39
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,879
skills to explain to them why you are
doing what you are doing, why you need

40
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,799
to take certain decisions, to boost the
security posture of the organization.

41
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,619
And there needs to be a
collaborative approach.

42
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:16,929
See you.

43
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:22,274
aspect of things, collaborative problem
solving individuals who are security

44
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,414
consultants, whether it's in cloud
security on any type of security,

45
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:32,524
there needs to be, a voluntary or an
intentional, effort to collaborate, in

46
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:36,614
solving problems because some problems
would need, One or more departments in the

47
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,814
organizations for it to be solved, right?

48
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:43,744
So for instance, if the accounting
department of a of an organization is

49
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:48,354
hacked and the security team comes in
to solve that problem, the security team

50
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:51,034
needs to work in a collaborative manner.

51
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,809
With the accountant with the members
of the accounting department to ensure

52
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:57,029
that the root of the matter is found.

53
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:01,389
It doesn't need to be adaptability
because I'm cyber security is

54
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,229
a few that changes very fast.

55
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,829
People who want to walk in this line
who wants to be into cloud security and

56
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:12,469
in any other area of cyber security,
they need to be adaptable and they

57
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,159
need to be continuously learning.

58
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,869
You cannot just depend on
what you learned yesterday.

59
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:18,879
You need to depend.

60
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,009
You need to keep on learning.

61
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,264
and Lenny, right?

62
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,764
See, there's a lot of, issues.

63
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,124
They even around generating.

64
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:28,804
I aren't a I did fix, so it is
continually changing the attack surface

65
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,174
for many organizations keep increasing.

66
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:36,654
So therefore, the cyber security,
workforce needs to also keep learning and

67
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:38,154
keep staying at the top of their game.

68
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,474
So effective communication,
why is it important, right?

69
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,964
Effective communication is important
because it is important for you

70
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:48,564
as a cybersecurity consultant to
be able to translate technical

71
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,404
concept into non technical bits.

72
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:52,064
that a layman can understand.

73
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,904
In that way, you are able
to drive across your point.

74
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:59,294
If you are a cybersecurity awareness
lead, for instance, in your organization,

75
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:03,024
and you are in charge of security
awareness in your organization.

76
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:06,574
Remember that not everybody in your
organization understands things around

77
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:09,344
cybersecurity or technical bits.

78
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,634
They may have some idea of IT, but
they might not understand why they need

79
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,324
to change their passwords regularly.

80
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:18,819
They might not understand Why did
they need to check emails properly

81
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,329
so that they don't fall victim to
phishing emails and things like that.

82
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,079
So you need to simplify it
into contextualize this.

83
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,049
You need to break it down with
storytelling to ensure that you

84
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:32,699
the idea or whatever is the aim
of the training you're conducting.

85
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,569
Is, passed across to
them and it's possible.

86
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,129
Some people learn better when
you show them a picture of what

87
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,109
you're trying to talk about.

88
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,899
they are visual learners, right?

89
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,769
So that if you have a picture of
adding diagrams, your presentations

90
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,019
would actually really help.

91
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:51,149
maybe dashboards, that might actually
really help in terms of storytelling.

92
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,229
So even though you're a cyber
security consultant, Having that

93
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,299
skill of storytelling is like very
important for you to actually have.

94
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,399
Then collaboration and empathy.

95
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,909
We're looking at
collaboration and empathy.

96
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,759
Relationship building is actually key.

97
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:07,469
Being able to form relationships with
people who are not in your department.

98
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,859
Like I mentioned the example
of the accounting department

99
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:11,729
and the security team.

100
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,659
Being able to work in tandem with
members that are not in your department.

101
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,379
People who are not of the same
background from you, people who are of

102
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,479
different races or different cultures
or different religions, and that talks

103
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,999
about in relationship building here,
it is essential to understand that what

104
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:31,339
is important is for you to understand
diversity and inclusion, okay, diversity

105
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:35,289
and inclusion, you need to be able to
work in a diverse environment, you need

106
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,509
to be able to build relationships with
people of diverse races and religion,

107
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,549
very important, and you need to have
emotional intelligence, You need to

108
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:46,519
know what to say, when to say it, and
in what manner to actually say it.

109
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,139
Sometimes it's not really about
what you say, but how you say it,

110
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,959
mannerisms actually matter and body
language actually also matters.

111
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:55,829
Okay.

112
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,239
So collaborative problem
solving, I'm talking about that.

113
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,849
The fact that if you're able
to build a relationship with

114
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,459
people, I'm able to have empathy.

115
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:05,584
Collaborative problem
solving comes naturally.

116
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:06,954
Okay, comes naturally.

117
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:08,074
That sort of skill comes naturally.

118
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:13,304
So you're able to work with, people,
in a team, if you have that, if you're

119
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:16,434
able to build a relationship easily,
very important people skills to have.

120
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:16,844
Okay.

121
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,194
in terms of navigating complexity.

122
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:22,174
It is important that you
are not resistant to change.

123
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,444
Change is constant.

124
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:27,054
And you must, like I said,
you must keep yourself abreast

125
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,094
with changes in your field.

126
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:30,454
Okay.

127
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,964
You must embrace change and
you must not resist change.

128
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:34,454
Okay.

129
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:37,334
So you need to anticipate change
because cybersecurity is a field that is

130
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,904
constantly changing, constantly evolving.

131
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:43,014
there are, there's always something
new to learn, so in whatever

132
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:46,134
line of cybersecurity, there's
always something new to learn.

133
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,839
It's always something, a new train,
so it's very important and critical

134
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,699
thinking is also like very important.

135
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:56,889
if you're into cyber security, you
definitely have to have critical thinking.

136
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,659
How do you approach the situation?

137
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,679
How do you communicate properly?

138
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,789
How do you, when there's an incident,
when an incident happens, how do

139
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,129
you, how do navigate this instant.

140
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,739
How do you communicate to the public in?

141
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,019
How do you organize your team?

142
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,909
How do you respond effectively?

143
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:17,019
How do you make sure that okay,
your data backups are restored?

144
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,859
How do you ensure that okay, your business
continuity plan is you stick to it and

145
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,559
there's little minimal disruption to
your business when an incident occurs.

146
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,469
All this would take critical thinking.

147
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:29,039
Okay.

148
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,169
And there's also the
case of agile responses.

149
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,504
Okay, so being able to adapt Okay.

150
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,174
being able to tips of agile.

151
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:37,544
We're talking about the fact
that you can always make changes.

152
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:41,564
You can always go back and say, okay,
we didn't, I've gone through this

153
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:44,564
process, but I didn't see that we are
going to have this kind of circumstance.

154
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,174
Okay, let's go back and change something.

155
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:46,784
Okay.

156
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,784
So it's more like having a growth mindset.

157
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:50,314
Okay.

158
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,524
Very important to have a growth mindset.

159
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:53,350
Been very important to talk about agile.

160
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,724
Look at by you being able to be
flexible in your approach to make

161
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:59,914
sure that you're able to solve
problems and navigate complexity.

162
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:06,574
So it is important for you as a
cybersecurity, workforce member

163
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:11,534
or a cybersecurity consultant,
or maybe a security analyst or a

164
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:14,904
cybersecurity engineer to understand
that you need to continuously learn.

165
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,434
I've said, I've spoken about this.

166
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,684
You need to embrace the fact that
if you're in cybersecurity, you

167
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:23,404
must be a lifelong learner and you
must cultivate a growth mindset.

168
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,314
I've spoken about that.

169
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,754
This closely relates to the Agile.

170
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:32,249
responses I spoke about, then it's also
important for you to be able to share

171
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:35,759
your knowledge and for you to be able
to share your knowledge, you need to

172
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,309
have effective communication skills.

173
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,669
So you see that all these soft
skills, they are like a chain,

174
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,609
they connect to each other.

175
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,079
Okay.

176
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:45,829
So you need to be able, if you are able
to have good relationship building skills.

177
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,319
You have good collaboration skills.

178
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,639
You have empathy.

179
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:50,249
Okay.

180
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:54,519
And you are willing to share you,
to be easy for you to, collaborate

181
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,319
and share knowledge in your team.

182
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,189
It's easy for you to mentor people.

183
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:58,579
Okay.

184
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,289
And it's easy for you to mentor people.

185
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,459
And it's also easy for you to be mentored.

186
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:02,499
Okay.

187
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:03,834
by people ahead of you.

188
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:07,064
Because if you have empathy, you have
emotional intelligence and you can

189
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:10,824
communicate effectively to say, Okay,
I think I'm lacking in this area.

190
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:11,634
I need to be.

191
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:14,214
I need directions on
how I can navigate this.

192
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:16,094
My learning journey and things like that.

193
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:19,049
your superiors can actually help
you and maybe place you on a

194
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,357
certification or something like that.

195
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,926
So you need to understand that.

196
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:25,066
Soft skills are not just,
something that is optional.

197
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:29,516
There are things that are, very like
important to have, it's important to

198
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:35,686
be able to have the soft skills and
so that to improve, your productivity.

199
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:40,296
Okay, in conclusion, I would just
say it's important for you to

200
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,666
cultivate a people centric mindset.

201
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:43,216
Okay.

202
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,736
Understand that you cannot
do cyber security alone.

203
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,776
You need people and the members of
your team are there to support you.

204
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:50,306
Okay.

205
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,946
So it's important you place, cyber
security, understand, embrace

206
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:57,536
the power of soft skills and
understand the human element.

207
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:01,346
is the center of, cyber security.

208
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:07,436
And of course, if an organization wants
to, build a resident, a resilient,

209
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,856
culture, they need to put people at
the center of that particular culture.

210
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,706
Whether it is for their security
awareness training, whether it is for

211
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:18,521
their incident response planning, the
future of cyber security lies in that.

212
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,721
in empowering the people who drive it,
and we empower these people by giving them

213
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:26,171
technical skills and also soft skills.

214
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,711
Thank you very much for listening.

215
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:28,961
Have a great day.

216
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:32,481
All right, I'm glad soft spoken
in this event, and, I hope

217
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,741
you enjoyed the presentation.

218
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:34,681
