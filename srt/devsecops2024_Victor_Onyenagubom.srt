1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,770
Hello, good day.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,470
My name is Victor Yonagibon and
I'm pleased to be speaking at

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,009
the conference to DevSecOps 2024.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,894
And today I'll be talking about
people power security, the role of

5
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:14,545
sub skills in a DevSecOps culture.

6
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:20,165
There's a lot of focus today around
technical skills and, but not a lot of,

7
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:25,625
there's not a lot of discussion around the
role that sub skills could play to improve

8
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,544
the security culture of an organization.

9
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:31,525
So looking at how sub skills like
communication, like empathy, like

10
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:36,254
collaboration, like relationship
building can actually improve security

11
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:38,015
awareness within an organization.

12
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,114
And this has to do with people.

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:40,185
Thank you.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,874
So First of all, we need to
understand that, there's a gap

15
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,404
in the cyber security landscape.

16
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:49,665
every day there are increase in
the type of cyber security threats.

17
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:53,615
the threats are evolving and
organizations need to stay vigilant.

18
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:54,395
Okay.

19
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,555
And since these threats are becoming
more and more complex, it's important

20
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:02,565
for organizations to rethink
the way they see cyber threats.

21
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:07,884
And in terms of in that interdisciplinary
approach, there needs to be a mix of.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,390
Technical sub skills in solving
these challenges, right?

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,450
We've seen the rise of social
engineering attacks that does

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,910
not just rely on technical
expertise, but also people, right?

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,610
To hack somebody, right?

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,510
To hack people based on their
emotions and take advantage of them.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,230
So there needs to be like, A combined
approach as regards solving cybersecurity

28
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,540
issues in the world we live in today.

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,410
So, how can we empower human element?

30
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,130
What are the importance of soft skills?

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,830
Why am I even talking about soft skills?

32
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,660
Is it important?

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,860
Why not?

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,870
Why should we not just focus on
the technical skills after all?

35
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,230
That is, isn't that what is always needed?

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,020
But we would see that soft
skills are like very important.

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,029
For instance, effective communication
is very crucial to the world.

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,720
Because if you are a cyber security
analyst, for instance, and you have to

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,879
give a presentation to the C level, maybe
to the CFO, to the CIO, to the CEO, they

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,119
may not be very technical people, and
you need to have effective communication

41
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,639
skills to explain to them why you are
doing what you are doing, why you need

42
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,559
to take certain decisions, to boost the
security posture of the organization.

43
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,379
And there needs to be a
collaborative approach.

44
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:22,689
See you.

45
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:28,034
aspect of things, collaborative problem
solving individuals who are security

46
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:31,174
consultants, whether it's in cloud
security on any type of security,

47
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:38,284
there needs to be, a voluntary or an
intentional, effort to collaborate, in

48
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:42,374
solving problems because some problems
would need, One or more departments in the

49
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,574
organizations for it to be solved, right?

50
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:49,504
So for instance, if the accounting
department of a of an organization is

51
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:54,114
hacked and the security team comes in
to solve that problem, the security team

52
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:56,794
needs to work in a collaborative manner.

53
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,569
With the accountant with the members
of the accounting department to ensure

54
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,789
that the root of the matter is found.

55
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,149
It doesn't need to be adaptability
because I'm cyber security is

56
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,989
a few that changes very fast.

57
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,589
People who want to walk in this line
who wants to be into cloud security and

58
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,229
in any other area of cyber security,
they need to be adaptable and they

59
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:19,919
need to be continuously learning.

60
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,629
You cannot just depend on
what you learned yesterday.

61
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,639
You need to depend.

62
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,769
You need to keep on learning.

63
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:27,024
and Lenny, right?

64
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,524
See, there's a lot of, issues.

65
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:29,884
They even around generating.

66
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:34,564
I aren't a I did fix, so it is
continually changing the attack surface

67
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,934
for many organizations keep increasing.

68
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:42,414
So therefore, the cyber security,
workforce needs to also keep learning and

69
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:43,914
keep staying at the top of their game.

70
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:47,234
So effective communication,
why is it important, right?

71
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,724
Effective communication is important
because it is important for you

72
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:54,324
as a cybersecurity consultant to
be able to translate technical

73
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:56,164
concept into non technical bits.

74
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,824
that a layman can understand.

75
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,664
In that way, you are able
to drive across your point.

76
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:05,054
If you are a cybersecurity awareness
lead, for instance, in your organization,

77
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,784
and you are in charge of security
awareness in your organization.

78
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:12,334
Remember that not everybody in your
organization understands things around

79
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:15,104
cybersecurity or technical bits.

80
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:18,394
They may have some idea of IT, but
they might not understand why they need

81
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,084
to change their passwords regularly.

82
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:24,579
They might not understand Why did
they need to check emails properly

83
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,089
so that they don't fall victim to
phishing emails and things like that.

84
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:29,839
So you need to simplify it
into contextualize this.

85
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,809
You need to break it down with
storytelling to ensure that you

86
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,459
the idea or whatever is the aim
of the training you're conducting.

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,329
Is, passed across to
them and it's possible.

88
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,889
Some people learn better when
you show them a picture of what

89
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,869
you're trying to talk about.

90
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,659
they are visual learners, right?

91
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,529
So that if you have a picture of
adding diagrams, your presentations

92
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,779
would actually really help.

93
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:56,909
maybe dashboards, that might actually
really help in terms of storytelling.

94
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,989
So even though you're a cyber
security consultant, Having that

95
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:04,059
skill of storytelling is like very
important for you to actually have.

96
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,159
Then collaboration and empathy.

97
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,669
We're looking at
collaboration and empathy.

98
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,519
Relationship building is actually key.

99
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,229
Being able to form relationships with
people who are not in your department.

100
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:16,619
Like I mentioned the example
of the accounting department

101
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,489
and the security team.

102
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,419
Being able to work in tandem with
members that are not in your department.

103
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:25,139
People who are not of the same
background from you, people who are of

104
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:29,239
different races or different cultures
or different religions, and that talks

105
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:32,759
about in relationship building here,
it is essential to understand that what

106
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,099
is important is for you to understand
diversity and inclusion, okay, diversity

107
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,049
and inclusion, you need to be able to
work in a diverse environment, you need

108
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,269
to be able to build relationships with
people of diverse races and religion,

109
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,309
very important, and you need to have
emotional intelligence, You need to

110
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:52,279
know what to say, when to say it, and
in what manner to actually say it.

111
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,899
Sometimes it's not really about
what you say, but how you say it,

112
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,719
mannerisms actually matter and body
language actually also matters.

113
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:01,589
Okay.

114
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,999
So collaborative problem
solving, I'm talking about that.

115
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,609
The fact that if you're able
to build a relationship with

116
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,219
people, I'm able to have empathy.

117
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:11,344
Collaborative problem
solving comes naturally.

118
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:12,714
Okay, comes naturally.

119
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,834
That sort of skill comes naturally.

120
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:19,064
So you're able to work with, people,
in a team, if you have that, if you're

121
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:22,194
able to build a relationship easily,
very important people skills to have.

122
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:22,604
Okay.

123
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,954
in terms of navigating complexity.

124
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:27,934
It is important that you
are not resistant to change.

125
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,204
Change is constant.

126
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,814
And you must, like I said,
you must keep yourself abreast

127
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,854
with changes in your field.

128
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:36,214
Okay.

129
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:39,724
You must embrace change and
you must not resist change.

130
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:40,214
Okay.

131
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:43,094
So you need to anticipate change
because cybersecurity is a field that is

132
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,664
constantly changing, constantly evolving.

133
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:48,774
there are, there's always something
new to learn, so in whatever

134
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,894
line of cybersecurity, there's
always something new to learn.

135
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,599
It's always something, a new train,
so it's very important and critical

136
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,459
thinking is also like very important.

137
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:02,649
if you're into cyber security, you
definitely have to have critical thinking.

138
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,419
How do you approach the situation?

139
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,439
How do you communicate properly?

140
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,549
How do you, when there's an incident,
when an incident happens, how do

141
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:12,889
you, how do navigate this instant.

142
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,499
How do you communicate to the public in?

143
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,779
How do you organize your team?

144
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,669
How do you respond effectively?

145
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,779
How do you make sure that okay,
your data backups are restored?

146
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,619
How do you ensure that okay, your business
continuity plan is you stick to it and

147
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,319
there's little minimal disruption to
your business when an incident occurs.

148
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,229
All this would take critical thinking.

149
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:34,799
Okay.

150
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:36,929
And there's also the
case of agile responses.

151
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,264
Okay, so being able to adapt Okay.

152
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:40,934
being able to tips of agile.

153
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,304
We're talking about the fact
that you can always make changes.

154
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:47,324
You can always go back and say, okay,
we didn't, I've gone through this

155
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,324
process, but I didn't see that we are
going to have this kind of circumstance.

156
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,934
Okay, let's go back and change something.

157
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:52,544
Okay.

158
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:55,544
So it's more like having a growth mindset.

159
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:56,074
Okay.

160
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,284
Very important to have a growth mindset.

161
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,110
Been very important to talk about agile.

162
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,484
Look at by you being able to be
flexible in your approach to make

163
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,674
sure that you're able to solve
problems and navigate complexity.

164
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:12,334
So it is important for you as a
cybersecurity, workforce member

165
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:17,294
or a cybersecurity consultant,
or maybe a security analyst or a

166
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:20,664
cybersecurity engineer to understand
that you need to continuously learn.

167
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:22,194
I've said, I've spoken about this.

168
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,444
You need to embrace the fact that
if you're in cybersecurity, you

169
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:29,164
must be a lifelong learner and you
must cultivate a growth mindset.

170
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,074
I've spoken about that.

171
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,514
This closely relates to the Agile.

172
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:38,009
responses I spoke about, then it's also
important for you to be able to share

173
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,519
your knowledge and for you to be able
to share your knowledge, you need to

174
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,069
have effective communication skills.

175
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,429
So you see that all these soft
skills, they are like a chain,

176
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,369
they connect to each other.

177
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:46,839
Okay.

178
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,589
So you need to be able, if you are able
to have good relationship building skills.

179
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,079
You have good collaboration skills.

180
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,399
You have empathy.

181
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,009
Okay.

182
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,279
And you are willing to share you,
to be easy for you to, collaborate

183
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,079
and share knowledge in your team.

184
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,949
It's easy for you to mentor people.

185
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:04,339
Okay.

186
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,049
And it's easy for you to mentor people.

187
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,219
And it's also easy for you to be mentored.

188
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:08,259
Okay.

189
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:09,594
by people ahead of you.

190
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,824
Because if you have empathy, you have
emotional intelligence and you can

191
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:16,584
communicate effectively to say, Okay,
I think I'm lacking in this area.

192
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:17,394
I need to be.

193
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,974
I need directions on
how I can navigate this.

194
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,854
My learning journey and things like that.

195
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,809
your superiors can actually help
you and maybe place you on a

196
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,117
certification or something like that.

197
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,686
So you need to understand that.

198
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,826
Soft skills are not just,
something that is optional.

199
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:35,276
There are things that are, very like
important to have, it's important to

200
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:41,446
be able to have the soft skills and
so that to improve, your productivity.

201
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:46,056
Okay, in conclusion, I would just
say it's important for you to

202
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:48,426
cultivate a people centric mindset.

203
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:48,976
Okay.

204
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,496
Understand that you cannot
do cyber security alone.

205
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:55,536
You need people and the members of
your team are there to support you.

206
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:56,066
Okay.

207
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,706
So it's important you place, cyber
security, understand, embrace

208
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:03,296
the power of soft skills and
understand the human element.

209
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:07,106
is the center of, cyber security.

210
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:13,196
And of course, if an organization wants
to, build a resident, a resilient,

211
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:17,616
culture, they need to put people at
the center of that particular culture.

212
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:20,466
Whether it is for their security
awareness training, whether it is for

213
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,281
their incident response planning, the
future of cyber security lies in that.

214
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:29,481
in empowering the people who drive it,
and we empower these people by giving them

215
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,931
technical skills and also soft skills.

216
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,471
Thank you very much for listening.

217
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:34,721
Have a great day.

218
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:38,241
All right, I'm glad soft spoken
in this event, and, I hope

219
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,501
you enjoyed the presentation.

220
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:40,441
Thank you very much.
