1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,320
Hi everyone, and thank you for
joining this session today.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Baskar Savan.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,890
I work as a team lead and
full stack software engineer.

4
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:11,630
I'm also an I Triple E senior member
with the Southeastern Michigan section.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,830
I have spent around 15 years building
and improving the develop pipelines,

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,160
automating the workflows, and
strengthening the delivery systems.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,430
Over the last few years, my focus has been
on supply chain security and AI driven

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,460
automation, helping teams adopt SBOs
Provenance and SLSA so they can deliver

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,190
the software that is both fast and secure.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,880
Today we are talking about the
supply chain defense by default,

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,360
SBOs, SLSA, and provenance in CICD.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,560
This talk is focused on the practical
security, not the theoretical

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,950
framework, not the security
checklist that sit in the document.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,010
No one really read, and
definitely not the heroic.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,000
That depends on the individuals
remembering to do something manually.

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:01:00,625
Instead, we will look to how to build
supply chain security directly into the

17
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,725
pipeline so that the secure path becomes
a default path, and the developers are

18
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,365
not slowed down by the security controls.

19
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,785
Security becomes a natural
outcome of the way system works.

20
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:17,135
The landscape of the software security
has shifted dramatically 10 years ago.

21
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:21,995
Attackers focus mainly on the application
level issues, SQ injection, cross

22
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:27,305
script scripting con misconfiguration,
but today they are going upstream and

23
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:29,135
attacking the software supply chain.

24
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,225
They're targeting open
source dependencies.

25
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:36,325
Package managers, CICD building
systems, artifact repositories.

26
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:41,665
And the automation that ships
code into the production.

27
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:46,845
Modern day pipelines move fast, which
is good, but fast pipeline that lacks

28
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:51,765
transparency or verification can become
the blind spot, and attackers loves

29
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,225
blind spots in many organizations.

30
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:58,725
CICD becomes the most trusted system,
but ironically, least verified.

31
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:03,220
Recent incident shows us why the
supply security chain is urgent.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,790
Solar Wind scale wasn't an application.

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,329
It was the build system
itself being compromised.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,810
Log four J wasn't a failure
of application code.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,990
It was a failure of visibility
into the dependencies.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,060
And the XZ backdoor showed us
that even a long term open source

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,280
maintainers can become attack vectors.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,560
These are not isolated cases.

39
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,120
They are part of the pattern.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,370
All of them teach the same lesson.

41
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,305
If you can't see what your software
supply chain, you can't secure it.

42
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:39,965
Security teams were blind spot blindsided,
not because the vulnerabilities were

43
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:45,005
impossible to address, but because they
lacked visibility, traceability, and the

44
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:46,970
proof of where the software came from.

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,230
So what does defense by default means?

46
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,299
It means building security into the
pipeline so deeply that developers

47
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,589
don't have to think about it.

48
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,890
Security is not a separate process, not
a afterthought, not a manual approval.

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,980
It's simply how the pipeline operates.

50
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,950
Every bill automatically
generates the evidence which

51
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,859
needed every artifact carried.

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,935
The metadata that proves is trustworthy.

53
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:19,285
Even a deployment is verified by the
platform itself, not by the person.

54
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:24,205
When the security is by default, it
becomes the consistent, predictable,

55
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:28,680
and scalable, and the developers can
stay focused on building not policy.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,770
ASBOs software build off materials
are one of the most effective

57
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,360
tool in the supply chain defense.

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,890
They are basically ingredient list
for your application that tells you

59
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,140
exactly what's inside your core base.

60
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,970
But here is the important
part, and ASBOs only works if

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,470
it's generated automatically.

62
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,600
On every build and stored with the
artifact when vulnerability hits log

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,670
four J, you shouldn't have to scramble.

64
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,730
You should be able to instantly
answer are we affected?

65
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,209
Where are we affected?

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,859
Which versions are impacted?

67
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:07,500
Organizations that had the s om
generally generator automatically

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,399
handles the four J law, four J in our
organization without SBOs pen dates.

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,600
Even some weeks just
figuring out where to start.

70
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,780
This is why the SBO M aren't
just paperwork, they're

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,190
operationally lifesaving.

72
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,580
Provenance answered the critical question.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,460
Can we prove how the software was built?

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,490
It's a full chain of
custody of an artifact.

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,979
Who builds it when it was built?

76
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:37,254
What source code is used,
what pipeline executed it, and

77
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,905
what environment it ran on.

78
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:43,039
Attestation are simply the
sign proof of this information.

79
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,989
This stops attacks.

80
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:48,079
Someone insert inserting a
malicious image into the registry.

81
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,999
A developer pushing a local bill
by accident, or the compromised ci

82
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,039
runner injecting something harmful.

83
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,719
If provenance is missing or incorrect,
the artifact should not be deployable.

84
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,650
And that's not something
human should decide.

85
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,890
It should be automated and
enforced by the system.

86
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,690
The SLSA framework
gives us a path forward.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,034
You don't need to start
at the highest level.

88
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,330
You start where you are
and match your over time.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,800
You begin by ensuring
the bli bills are logged.

90
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,010
Then you ensure bills run from
the version control scripts.

91
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,199
Then you add provenance, sign
signing, and eventually you

92
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,359
reach the ame reproducible bill.

93
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,689
SLSA is not about perfection.

94
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,139
It's about making each link
in a supply chain stronger.

95
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,719
Even small improvements
make a big difference.

96
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:43,900
Once we begin strengthening the pipeline,
several important controls comes

97
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,050
into play first, keyless assigning CI
pipeline, gender temporarily identities.

98
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,900
Instead of re relying, replying,
relying on a stored private keys.

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,260
Imperial Runners built environments
are de destroyed after each run to

100
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,700
reduce the long term compromise.

101
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,159
Immutable artifacts once published
artifacts cannot be si silently, swt,

102
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,680
or replaced deployment and verification.

103
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,150
The platform checks signatures and
prominence before allowing the deployment.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,849
This means the system, not the
humans validates trust, and that's

105
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,270
the only scalable way to secure
the modern delivery pipeline.

106
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,909
Run in isolation with no network
access and no ability to face the

107
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,890
unknown dependencies during the build.

108
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,219
They rely on a pre-approved
PIN components.

109
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:35,979
Reproduceable Bills ensures that the same
input always produce the same output.

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,010
This lets us detect the
tampering instantly.

111
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,150
Together.

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,229
This approach transform your
pipeline from open work shop into

113
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,400
the control environment where every
input and output can be verified.

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,710
Dependency hygiene might sound
simple, but is one of the most

115
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,060
impactful thing you can do.

116
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:58,965
It means pinning versions, reviewing
all new libraries, avoiding

117
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:02,895
floating dependency versions,
and preventing automated updates

118
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:04,784
from bypassing security review.

119
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:09,075
This keeps the unverified code
from sneaking in silently.

120
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,515
One of the most common way attackers
get into the supply chain code

121
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,604
dependency hygiene creates the
stability and predictability.

122
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,814
Let me share the practical example.

123
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,389
That shows how powerful
these practices can be.

124
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:28,099
Before implementing the supply chain
defense, one team was deploying the

125
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,659
microservices to the Kubernetes.

126
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,649
Their pipeline was fast, but not verified.

127
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,509
Deployers could push local
images into the registry.

128
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,320
ASBOs were inconsistent, and
Providence wasn't enforced.

129
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:45,719
When the log four J Crisis hits,
it took almost a full week just

130
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,159
to locate the affected services.

131
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,830
Now let's look at the after.

132
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:54,119
Once they adopted the supply
chain defense, by default, every

133
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,739
bill was signed automatically.

134
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,300
Every artifact produced the
SBOs Bernet enforced signature

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,099
verification and dependency.

136
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,629
Metadata was centralized.

137
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,640
Later during the simul simulated
vulnerabilities event, they identify

138
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,440
all the impacted services in a minute.

139
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,609
What's beautiful about this
is that security improved,

140
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,780
but velocity didn't drop.

141
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,590
Pipeline becomes safer
without becoming slower.

142
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,300
That's the ideal balance.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,790
Deployment is a movement
where the risk become real.

144
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,700
Everything before deployment
is a hypothetical.

145
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,639
Risk deployment is the point of no return.

146
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,789
This is why the deployment,
time enforcement is.

147
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,429
If the artifact lacks the valid
signature or provenance deployment

148
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,330
should simply fail, not with
an email, not with a warning.

149
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,710
Just hard stop.

150
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,050
This prevents the accidental deployments,
malicious insert, and unapproved builds.

151
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,820
Think of it as a last checkpoint, the
final quality gate before the production.

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,830
One.

153
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,550
One of the biggest misconception is
that the supply chain defense requires

154
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,920
a massive all at once transformation.

155
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,640
It isn't.

156
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,690
You start small, begin by
generating SPO automatically.

157
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,700
Then add signing and provenance in ci.

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Verification in staging, and
once the process is stable,

159
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,390
enforce it in the production.

160
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,070
This phased approach, the delivery
smooth and builds organizational.

161
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,680
Let me add one more important
piece that often gets overlooked.

162
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,210
The cultural shift.

163
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,430
Supply chain security is not just about
tooling problem, it's a mindset shift.

164
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:33,890
Teams need to move from, we trust
our pipeline to our pipeline.

165
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,300
Pers it can be trusted.

166
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,800
They need to move from.

167
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:42,454
We hope our dependencies are safe
to, we know exactly what we are

168
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:44,584
shipping and they need to move.

169
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:48,245
Move on from security
slows us down to security.

170
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,505
Done right, speed up.

171
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:54,835
By preventing the emergencies, the real
transformation happens when developers

172
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,825
develop engineers and the security
team all see supply chain defense as

173
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:01,225
a shared advantage, not an optical.

174
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:05,650
When the shift happens, adoption
becomes smooth and natural.

175
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,760
Here are the few key
takeaways from our discussion.

176
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:13,265
First, the software supply chain
has be, become one of the most

177
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,824
active cybersecurity battle work.

178
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,315
Battlegrounds attackers are targeting
dependencies, build systems, and

179
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,655
automation, not just the production apps.

180
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:28,165
So if we don't secure the pipeline,
we can't secure words comes out of it.

181
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:32,005
Second, the strongest defense
is the shifting security

182
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,575
into the CICD process system.

183
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:38,755
Ev when every artifact is signed,
stress able and verified automatically,

184
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,925
we reduce this risk without
slowing down the delivery pipeline.

185
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,485
Trust become the application trust.

186
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,715
Third, the tools and the practices
were dis, were discussed.

187
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,460
As bombs, ance attestation, SLS,
AMIC bills and the deploy time

188
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,710
verification are not theoretical.

189
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,540
They are practical adopt steps,
adoptable steps that any organization

190
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,070
can start implementing in phases.

191
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,570
And finally, remember this security
should not depend on a late

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,280
night heroics or manual checks.

193
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,180
It should be the default outcome
of how we build the software

194
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,070
when we design the pipeline that
enforce the security automatically.

195
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,845
We protect our systems and empower our
teams to innovate with the confidence.

196
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:25,345
Before I close, I want
you to leave with this.

197
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:29,125
Security shouldn't depend on the
people remembering the steps.

198
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,765
It should be the build into the pipeline.

199
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,015
So every release is trusted by default.

200
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:39,205
If we can make supply chain
security automatic, we make our

201
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,655
team faster, safer, and more
resilient without slowing innovation.

202
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:45,015
Thank you all for your
time and attention today.
