00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,470
Hello and welcome to an existing
edition of our podcast, bridging

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,610
Science and Spirituality, the future
of mobile and digital knowledge

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,100
management, where we explore what
happens when technology, science

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,380
and spiritually spirituality needs.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,660
I am xla.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,470
I'm thrilled to be joined by 2 billion
HE, Dr. Ranita kli and Priam kli.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,370
Together we have been working
on an innovative mobile

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,509
platform called Neo Light.

9
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,669
Designed to make learning across
spiritual and scientific domains.

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,679
the app right now is in the alpha
testing phase and it is very

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,750
powerful, in and personal from a
deep, from a developer point of view.

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,080
I have spent months architecting
and deploying Neo light

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,179
on the Android platform.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,640
It's been a deeply technical journey.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,239
Configuring, get compost, firebase, file
store, optimize offline support for the.

16
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:58,980
The purpose behind it has been
equally profound, building a digital

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,350
sanctuary for seekers of all kinds.

18
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:02,239
Thank you, sva.

19
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,269
Yeah, thanks a lot, sva.

20
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,109
this has been a collaborative labor
of love and I'm delighted to be here.

21
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,779
While Shva focused on the foundation
I worked on curating and testing

22
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:19,489
the spiritual content to ensure it
resonates emotionally and energetically.

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,880
with the users, my role focused on
tuning, the ancient wisdom and turning

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,470
it to daily practice through the
app, which required a lot of user

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,930
empathy and cultural sensitivity.

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,640
Hi everyone.

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,330
My name is Priam and
I'm the content analyst.

28
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,610
And, from my side, I helped,
bridging the scientific concepts,

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,790
with cognitive, learning strategies.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,210
Neo light is just not
a information platform.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,390
I would say it's a form of
living, breathing tool as well,

32
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,300
and that evolves with the user.

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,590
I, currently worked on, validating
and testing the pathways using neuro

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,490
neuroscience principles and making
sure we are aligned, learning with the

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,770
learning with how our brain works too.

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,390
The synergy we have built between
spirit science and code mix.

37
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,990
This one of the most unique
digital platforms I have had

38
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,130
the pleasure on working on.

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,375
Thank you Ranita.

40
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:16,655
And.

41
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:23,215
So near light began as a simple idea
to the billion app that doesn't just

42
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:28,735
deliver information, but nurtures the
consciousness from a technical standpoint.

43
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:33,295
This meant building a scalable, modular
system that could support structured

44
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,885
learning paths, micro learning modules
and spiritual practices without

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,720
needing constant internet access.

46
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:40,915
The app.

47
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:45,025
The app runs on preferred content
right now, meaning all resources

48
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:50,335
are bundled securely within the app,
making it usable in, in the remote

49
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:56,255
and rural regions with the limited
data access for, yeah, actually, I

50
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,715
remember testing those early bills.

51
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,605
Simplicity was the key.

52
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:04,835
A verse in the morning, a
meditation prompt in the evening.

53
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:10,055
When consistently practiced these
small rituals transformed how

54
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,305
users related to their inner cells.

55
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:17,225
We wanted to make that a spiritual
process, not just, accessible,

56
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:22,125
to everybody, but as a natural
and as much as possible, like

57
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,015
sipping tea or going for a walk.

58
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:28,175
And when it comes to about that
app, we have backed it with data.

59
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:33,755
We observed that the users felt calmer
and pacified, and much more focused

60
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:37,355
when the content rhythm matched their
psychological state of mind as well.

61
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:40,385
Our models weren't just
spiritually meaningful.

62
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,890
But we actually, they were
placed in a scientific manner.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,920
One of my favorite test runs showed a user
sleep score particularly improved using

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,950
our guided breath model for just one week.

65
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,410
Yes, exactly.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,980
Priam.

67
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,640
So scientific spiritualism is a term we
often use, but it deserves deep unpacking.

68
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:06,265
It's not just about using science
to prove spirituality, not using

69
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,854
spirituality to, mystify science.

70
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:14,044
It's about treating both as complimentary
paths to understand the human condition.

71
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:19,174
One observes from the outside in
and the other from the inside out.

72
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:23,215
Exactly when we build the
pathways in your light, we were

73
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,805
intentional about our journey.

74
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,294
You might start with neuroscience.

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,310
Explainer or emotion regulation over here.

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,300
But then we eventually, we
moved into guided practice from

77
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,710
Budhist philosophy as well.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,690
We built this bridges between content
that seemed unrelated, but actually

79
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,300
completes a full circle of understanding.

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,250
Thank you.

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,631
my response will be was to make sure
this journey was technically possible.

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,540
Our content management system built to
tag content semantically by emotion.

83
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,335
Topic, tradition, and even energy level.

84
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:04,205
So if you want to explore balance, the
app can surface resources from multiple

85
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,425
disciplines and help you see that.

86
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:10,655
Science and spirituality are really just
different languages of the same truth.

87
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:16,480
And we often call neo late as a digital
tempo and they truly believe that.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,070
Every screen color transition and
font was selected with intention.

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,100
The tech stack jet pack, composed fire
base and room database for offline

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,630
learning allowed us to construct a
robust backend and elegant front end.

91
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,260
But more than that, we
treated every design decision.

92
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,640
Like a spiritual choice.

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,650
Exactly.

94
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,340
It's univa.

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,450
So the results showed during testing.

96
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,770
Because when we were testing it,
users say that the app felt safe,

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,750
and that was a powerful word.

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,230
Indeed.

99
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,310
One said it felt like opening
a sacred book, and another

100
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,690
described it as a mirror.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,690
We are often used to noisy, chaotic
apps, but neo light was built to

102
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,330
feel like a white walk in the forest.

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,295
And Ranita, as you have rightly
mentioned, we have also validated

104
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:10,845
this using UX psychology principles.

105
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:16,785
We have reduced the visual clutter, muted
tones and strategic micro interactions,

106
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:18,465
lower cognitive loads as well.

107
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:23,835
When users experience less friction
there, they engage more deeply and the

108
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,935
digital becomes devotional as well.

109
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:26,855
Yes.

110
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,165
So what is the science of microlearning?

111
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,755
Spirituality doesn't always
come in grand gestures.

112
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,405
It often whispers.

113
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,835
That's where microlearning comes in.

114
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:44,135
Users may not have time for a full hour of
study, but they can engage with a verse,

115
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,895
a question or a three minute reflection.

116
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:52,435
So we tested this and with a daily
rhythm and it really works well.

117
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:57,775
We use learning science models like,
spaced reputation and contextual

118
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,605
queuing to design content.

119
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:04,675
So suppose when someone reads about
gratitude in the morning, they might

120
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,075
be nudged later to reflect our journal.

121
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:11,335
And also this reinforces
their memory and emotions.

122
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,095
Creating a loop of learning
and transformations.

123
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,435
Yeah, exactly.

124
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,165
So implementing this was a technical joy.

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,240
We engineered the app to send
notifications based on based on

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,370
user preference, not just time,
but mood, content, affinity.

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,460
And since it's all stored on device for
now, it's a fast, private, and stable.

128
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,410
And even during travel are low
connectivity periods when the people are

129
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,960
traveling to remote locations and even
when they're like hiking and if they want

130
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,585
to rest in a kind of, like outing, right?

131
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,615
Anywhere you can access the
app because the data sitting

132
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,835
on your local devices, right?

133
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:58,685
So what we can summarize, like this app
can be a companion that understands you.

134
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:03,115
So new light is not just a mobile
application, it's a companion, it's

135
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:07,375
a friend, it's sentiment aware,
interfaces and voice recognition

136
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,400
tools, helps in development.

137
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,990
And we also, want the platform to
respond just more above than the clicks.

138
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,631
It should respond to energy as well.

139
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,361
Exactly, yes.

140
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:23,621
I do remember when we tested the
voice queries with different tones.

141
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:27,491
The users asking, I feel
lost, or Show me peace.

142
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:32,321
The app responded with curated
modules like chance, poems,

143
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:34,030
songs, and reflections.

144
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:38,171
It became more than smart and
it became just compassionate.

145
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:41,611
Thank you, Anita, for your kind
words, but we are still early

146
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:42,781
in that process right now.

147
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,350
the app doesn't use real
time data, but works with

148
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,960
carefully curated prepaid files.

149
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,430
That gives us control and consistency
during our alpha testing phase,

150
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,680
but once we go public, AI will
help it to grow into something even

151
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,690
more interactive and personalized.

152
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,620
And we are currently in alpha testing,
phase gathering feedback, refining ui,

153
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,950
ux, and finalizing multi-language support.

154
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,240
The content is preloaded and there
is no real time data sync yet.

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,220
But soon we will begin rolling out
our beta with guided meditation

156
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,890
series, a HR support and.

157
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm specially excited about
the collaboration tools.

158
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,410
We are working on community led
journeys where groups can follow

159
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,610
the same path, reflect together,
and build wisdom collectively.

160
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,540
It's called as a spiritual mentorship
reimagined for the mobile age, and

161
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,820
scientifically, we want to integrate
passive biometrics, measuring focus.

162
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:48,705
Heart rate and even voice stress levels
as well to adjust the contact, the,

163
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,745
to adjust the content dynamically.

164
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:55,035
The long-term goal, an app that
evolves with you emotionally,

165
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:59,286
cognitively, morally, logically,
sure, and spiritually as well.

166
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,096
So your light isn't just a software.

167
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:07,046
So it's quite kind of a soul where
you can see a space where seekers

168
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,716
can pause, breathe, and begin again.

169
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:13,816
I would say it's a bridge
connecting heart, mind, and machine.

170
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,266
And it's built with care,
