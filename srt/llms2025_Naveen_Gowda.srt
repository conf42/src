1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,910
I'm happy to be here today.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,260
I'm Navin Kado.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,580
I've been working in the field of
automations and cloud technologies for

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,060
many years, and I'm excited to share
with you how AI is revolutionizing

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,920
financial reconciliations.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,870
In today's work where speed,
accuracy, and complaints are

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
paramount, AI plays a critical role.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,970
But also the human expertise
is still very necessary.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,570
We are gonna explore how AI and
human collaboration can drastically

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,810
improve our financial processes.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,820
Let's jump right end.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,085
So let's start by looking
at where we are today.

14
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:51,265
Large enterprises rely on complex
ERP systems, and this systems make

15
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:57,415
reconciliation a tough processes because
they don't always integrate smoothly.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,440
I. You have teams handling a
different systems manually,

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,020
which often causes bottleneck.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,410
For example, a 30% delay in month
end closing is not uncommon,

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,600
especially in companies that is
still heavily on manual processes.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,420
As global digital transactions
grow exponentially, the volume

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,460
of data the companies needs to
reconcile will become overwhelming.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,440
Without automations in this
rapidly evolving landscape,

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,330
the traditional approach to
reconciliations simply can't keep up.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,020
So how AI come into the play.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,530
First, AI can actually detect patents
like spatting, duplicate invoices

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,930
faster than human ever could do.

27
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,440
AI driven patent recognitions through
mission learning and natural language

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,530
processing can identify issues
within seconds that would otherwise

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,050
take days or even weeks to detect.

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,840
And we also can have RPA robotic
process automation tool pair with

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,560
ai, and this automations can reduce
MA many manual touch points by

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,280
60%, which speeds up processes and
significantly reduces human errors.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,320
Imagine a system where a routine
reconciliations are happening

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,860
in the background without
constant human oversight.

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,620
And finally, AI shines
in exceptional handling.

36
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,920
With predictive analytics, AI can
forecast animal with up to 85%

37
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,110
accuracy, drastically cutting down
the time needed for resolutions.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,040
This allows your human team to focus
on more complex value added task.

39
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
Now let's talk about the benefits of
combining human intelligence with ai.

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,230
And this is not about AI replacing jobs.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,820
It's about empowering humans
to do more meaningful work.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,805
First, we see improved accuracy.

43
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:19,220
AI can reduce false positives
by 40%, which means fewer errors

44
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,890
and cleaner financial records.

45
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,519
In a world where we, even a small
mistakes can cost million, this is

46
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,629
crucial in terms of efficiencies.

47
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,659
The AI power reconciliation systems
can reduce month and close cycles

48
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:40,179
from 10 days to just three days.

49
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:45,944
That's a huge time saver, especially
for larger organizations where even

50
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:48,374
delays can have ripple effects.

51
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:50,344
And finally, ai.

52
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:56,915
With the risk management, regulatory
compliance risk drops by 50% because AI

53
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:03,424
assisted audit catches potentials issues
before they become more major problems.

54
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:10,054
It ensures your always head of the
CO when it comes to the compliance.

55
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:13,554
Let's dive into the technical
implementation strategy.

56
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,195
To implement a AI in a
financial reconciliations,

57
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,625
you need a clear strategy.

58
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,044
First, we start with a system.

59
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,094
Integrations.

60
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:30,755
We can utilize IPAs tool like MuleSoft
with the API LED architecture and

61
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:37,625
queuing mechanism enables a faster and
real time reconciliations across ERPs.

62
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:43,375
This ensures seamless communications
between different systems.

63
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:51,305
Next, as training programs resulted in a
91% eruption rate, this shows how with the

64
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,575
right training, the teams are benefited.

65
00:04:55,075 --> 00:05:00,295
Phase implementation is a key where
we can achieve a scalable deployment.

66
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:07,090
And with the AI driven proof of concept,
we can accelerate the go live time by 64%.

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,890
Lastly, the feedback loops are essential.

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,930
We found that biweekly sprint reviews
improve system utilizations close to 67%.

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,750
This iterative feedback ensures
the system is always improving and

70
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,910
adapting to their business needs.

71
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,290
This numbers really sparks for themself.

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,500
The companies that have adopted AI
for reconciliations, I've seen of 45%

73
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,480
of cost reductions, saving millions
of dollars annually by automating

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,520
their reconciliation processes.

75
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,560
Reconciliation times, which used to
take five days are now reduced to just

76
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,940
hours, gaining almost 67% in efficiency.

77
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,000
So this matrix shows how AI is not
just nice to have, but a must have for

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,700
companies looking to stay competitive.

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,599
Looking forward for ai, AI will
continue to have a transformative

80
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,510
impact on financial reconciliations.

81
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,539
Processing times will drop by 70%.

82
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:23,034
Making gig, making it easier to manage
even larger volume of transaction

83
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,075
without overwhelming the team.

84
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:30,915
However, the key to the success is
man, maintaining a balance approach.

85
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:38,055
While AI is incredible at handling data,
it still requires human insights to

86
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:44,565
make sure AI outputs align with business
needs and regulatory requirements.

87
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:50,085
That human oversight is crucial
in maintaining accuracy and

88
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,104
relevance as regulatory evolve.

89
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:59,794
AI systems will also need to evolve
adapting to new laws and guidelines,

90
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:02,794
which ensures long-term compliance.

91
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,604
Thank you all for your time today.

92
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:12,025
I truly hope this session provided a
valuable insight into powerful potential

93
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,364
of AI in financial reconciliation.

94
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:19,645
I. My goal was to highlight not
only the technical possibilities,

95
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:25,284
but also the real world benefits of
leveraging human AI collaboration.

96
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,025
As we move forward.

97
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:32,304
I encourage you to explore how these
technologies can transform your workflows

98
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,244
and help your organization thrive.

99
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,814
I'm excited about the future of AI driven
finance, and I look forward to seeing

100
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:44,664
the innovation we will create together.

101
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:45,585
Thank you.
