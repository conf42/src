1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,640
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,170
It's wonderful to be here
at conference 42 ML Labs.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,389
My name is Shelia kgi and
I am Systems QA engineer.

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:16,610
With 18 plus years of experience
in the information technology and

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,040
software development industries
over the years, I have seen how

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,310
machine learning and automations have
transformed industries like healthcare.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,540
The finance, manufacturing, but there
is one area that often goes unnoticed.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,060
The place where we all live,
our residential communities.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,489
Welcome to today's presentation on
revolutionizing the community living.

10
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:53,885
Through artificial intelligence, how AI
can transform the fragmented community

11
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,514
into connected, thriving ecosystems.

12
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:02,935
As someone with extensive experience
and technology integration and

13
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:08,664
living in community, I'll share my
challenges, the hidden costs, and most

14
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:15,535
importantly, how an AI driven solution
can empower the residents, the managers.

15
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,410
And the community as a whole.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,080
And just to be clear, what I'm gonna
present today is part of my vision.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,770
The goal is to spark the ideas about
what's possible, the challenges

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,340
of disconnected community living.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,810
Um, let me start with
the familiar scenarios.

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,480
How many of us have missed the last day of
school registration because the reminder

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,700
was buried in the WhatsApp messages.

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,300
Or maybe we have wished our kids could
meet other children nearby instead of

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,240
spending hours in front of the screen, or
perhaps you have hired a service provider

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,780
only to regret the decision after hours
of searching and endless back and forth.

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,610
This is the reality of residential
community living today.

26
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,965
In fact, the studies shows that about
23% of the US population, that's 77

27
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:19,200
million people live in some of the
farm of the community association like

28
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,080
HOAs, condos and housing cooperatives.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,580
And more than 80% of new homes sold in
2023 were part of these communities.

30
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,810
Yet the experience of living
in them is often fragmented.

31
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,250
Communication is scattered all over.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,190
Service coordination is slow and
manual, and residents lack the

33
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,630
visibility into the resources that
could improve their daily lives.

34
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,480
In short, people are living side by
side, but not really living together.

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,704
So the what's the true?

36
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:59,734
Cost of the fragmentation
first, it's time drain.

37
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,275
In today's world, time is everything.

38
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:08,235
The importance of timing and the
feeling of constant pressure,

39
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:14,085
residents waste hours of navigating
multiple apps, threats and follow ups.

40
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:20,560
Secondly, it erodes the trust and
satisfaction when processors are.

41
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,190
Inefficient, the communication
becomes poor and residents began

42
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,860
to feel isolated and frustrated.

43
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,350
The next one is the valuable
community assets, clubhouses,

44
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,090
greenhouse, green space.

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,800
Even, uh, events remain underutilized
because people simply don't have.

46
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:48,315
Uh, don't have time to go there or don't
know how, what to use, how to use them.

47
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:54,465
And finally, the property managers are
struck in endless manual workflows,

48
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:59,355
preventing them from building the
proactive, the connected communities.

49
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:05,415
This combination quite eats away
an engagement, the satisfaction,

50
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,485
and yes, even the property value.

51
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,485
So I'm going to the next slide.

52
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:10,225
Introducing.

53
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:17,925
What the AI power single pane of
glass, this is where the AI can help.

54
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:23,355
Imagine a single unified
dashboard that consolidates all

55
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:26,235
essential residential services.

56
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:31,815
The information, the communication
into one simple view interface

57
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:35,805
that consolidates data and
management tools from various

58
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:38,235
systems and sources into single.

59
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,630
Centralized view and streamlines
the operation through

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,330
intelligent AI automation.

61
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:52,680
Now add the personalization AI that
knows you are a parent with a 7-year-old,

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,990
so it shows use school updates
only, like the kid activities, the

63
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,145
tutoring opportunities instead of 11.

64
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:01,665
Nice.

65
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:07,475
And behind the scene, the
automation reduces the overhead.

66
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,545
No more changes down.

67
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,915
The managers are shifting
through the clutters.

68
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:16,655
This is what all called AI powered.

69
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:22,175
I call the AI powered the single
pane of glass solution, a platform

70
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:27,665
that is resident first and manager
friendly and designated to make

71
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:30,035
the communities more connected.

72
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:35,415
So going to the next slide, how
these service providers can help the

73
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,935
education is one part of the life.

74
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:39,875
Let's start with education.

75
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,035
A bigger priority for families.

76
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,275
The platform aggregates school.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,910
Reviews from multiple trusted sources and
gives parents a clear, comprehensive view.

78
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,840
It tailors the recommendation
to your child's age.

79
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,230
If you have elementary school,
you only see the content

80
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,480
relevant to ages five through 11.

81
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,740
It can also suggest extracurricular
opportunities from math

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,240
tutor the football coaches.

83
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,250
For high schooler, it can only
feed in about academic clubs,

84
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,850
such as debate, math, science,
coding, and leadership, depending

85
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,580
on the family needs and interests.

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,010
The beauty is that the system
learns over the time with families,

87
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,320
engage with certain recommendations.

88
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,110
The model continuously refines
results, creating the virtuous

89
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,790
cycles of optimization.

90
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,140
The education is one part of the life.

91
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:44,490
What about the daily services that keep
our homes running the platform Bills?

92
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,510
A trusted service provider ecosystem.

93
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,590
It connects you with the ai,
wetted, plumbers, electricians, or

94
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,560
handyman, complete with ratings.

95
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
The prices, the real time availability.

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,230
It automates the scheduling for
property and upkeep like lawn care,

97
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,175
snow removal, or pest control, and even
add smart, sensational recommendations.

98
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,495
It goes further.

99
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:14,835
Uh, recommending financial services like
mortgage refinancing or home insurance

100
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:20,175
options, as well as healthcare reference
with the fast appointment bookings.

101
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:26,865
It's not just convenience, it's a
peace of mind knowing you are making

102
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:29,535
a reliable cost effective choices.

103
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:33,905
So the advanced AI
capabilities, now let's, let's.

104
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:35,725
Uh, peek under the oath.

105
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:40,735
The platform leverages the
productive analytics to

106
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,895
anticipate the residents needs.

107
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:48,535
For instance, if families usually
request maintenance right after the

108
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:54,355
first of all, the system can prepare
resources in advance, natural language

109
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:58,885
processing powers, chat boards that
allow residents to interact naturally.

110
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:05,505
So no technical learning curve
needed, and the computer vision

111
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:10,275
helps with facility monitoring,
automatically generating maintenance

112
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,195
tickets when issues are detected.

113
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:18,165
All of this works together to
create a deeply personalized,

114
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,235
yet seamless experience.

115
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,055
Enhancing the community
engagement also comes with the.

116
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:27,665
Connectivity and the engagement.

117
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,815
Of course, the real power
of the community is people.

118
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:35,585
This platform enhances
connectivity and engagement.

119
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:41,375
It enables seamless facility
reservations, reducing booking conflicts.

120
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:45,335
It matches the rental opportunities
with the high success rate.

121
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,620
It even coordinates play dates for
families with children of similar

122
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,470
ages that are so built in support for
youth voluntary programs, encouraging

123
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,060
participation and giving young residents
way to contribute their community.

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,480
As a result, a virtuous cycle, a
stronger connection that lead to more

125
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,490
engagement and more engagement drives
the greater adoption on the platform.

126
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,340
Going to the next slide.

127
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,245
It's.

128
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:19,885
The real time housing market insights.

129
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:23,485
The another benefit is
the financial empowerment.

130
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:28,225
The platform is provides the
real time property valuations

131
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:33,385
insights that typically reserve
for real estate professionals.

132
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,455
It shows how the neighbor would
come, impro implements directly

133
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,195
impact your home's values.

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,820
It suggests the property upgrades
with the predictive ROI and also lets

135
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,210
you benchmark the comparable sales,
inform the data driven decisions, help

136
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,580
residents grow personal wealth, and also
pro promote the community stability.

137
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,180
So what, how the future
development roadmap looks like.

138
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,880
So where does this go from here?

139
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,660
Uh, in the near term we see enhancements
like product maintenance for shared

140
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,180
areas, more personalized services and
better social connectivity features.

141
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,880
Looking further ahead, the long term
vision includes the autonomous community.

142
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,100
Vehicle management imagined shared
self-driving shutters for residents.

143
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,520
Why not the system used to operate,
monitor, and maintain autonomous

144
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,795
vehicles for the community use?

145
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:42,995
It has a potential to provide a safer,
more efficient, and more equitable

146
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:47,255
transportation option for residents,
which in turn reduces the traffic.

147
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:48,905
And emissions.

148
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:55,115
So the, these are the lot of options
we can come up with these AI solutions.

149
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:59,645
The, the another option is integrational
engagement programs, connecting

150
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:05,615
toddlers, youth, the seniors in the
meaningful ways to build the mutually

151
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:11,075
beneficial relationships and as well
as the foster community, uh, cohesions,

152
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:15,695
the, and the cross community networks
that link different neighborhoods.

153
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:19,385
To solve the shared challenges
and the opportunities.

154
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:22,775
So AI is not static.

155
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:29,495
It continuously evolves, incorporates
new data and new technologies to keep

156
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:32,075
improving the residents experience.

157
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:36,805
So going to the next slide,
transforming communities together,

158
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:42,505
let's bring it back to impact AI
driven communities offer the enhanced

159
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:46,880
living experience with convenience
and quality or life at the forefront.

160
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:52,585
The success starts at the community
level By valuing the local expertise

161
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:56,965
and putting decisions, making power
in hands of the residents, and also

162
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,245
can make quicker and wiser decisions.

163
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:01,495
The property value growth.

164
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:06,145
As connected, engaged neighbor
root becomes more desirable.

165
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,555
Operational excellence.

166
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,870
This study is the cost
improving service quality.

167
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,230
The true community
transformation ensures that.

168
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,060
All these voices are heard and benefits
the change to reach every individual and

169
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,600
a sustainable future with smarter use
of resources for greener communities.

170
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,080
The real transformation happens
when residents feel empowered, when

171
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,390
local expertise are valued, and when
decision making power is shared.

172
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,420
So to wrap up.

173
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,670
The story of AI is residential communities
isn't about technology for its own sake.

174
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
It's about people.

175
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,970
It's about building the places
where neighbors are connected,

176
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,600
empowered resources are
visible, decisions are smarter.

177
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,880
The future of the community is living,
is unified, intelligent, and inclusive.

178
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:11,775
Uh, thank you for giving this opportunity
to share the vision with you all today.

179
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:12,330
Thank you.
