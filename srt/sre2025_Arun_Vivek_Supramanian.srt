00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,170
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,490
I am Numan.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,990
Today I will be speaking on a big data
and machine learning in healthcare

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,530
and how these technologies are
driving improvements in diagnostic

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,820
accuracy, personalized treatment
planning, and operational optimization.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,440
We will explore the data landscape
and scalable processing architectures

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,940
and the role of machine learning in
analyzing patient's data at scale.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,710
Healthcare data is growing
exponentially by 2025.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,759
It's projected to reach 2,500
exabytes growing faster than any other

10
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,980
industry, including finance and media.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,370
Here's the kicker, 80% of
the data is unstructured.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,839
Things like imaging, clinical nodes,
and sensor data from variables.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,530
The opportunity healthcare
providers using big data have

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,050
reported cost reduction of to 20%.

15
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,615
And improved patients outcome by 30%.

16
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:56,705
But to get there, we need systems that can
handle this data reliable and securely.

17
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:01,345
And at scale source of healthcare
data, let's take a look closer.

18
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,205
Look at where this data comes from.

19
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:09,295
EHRs includes patient's history,
medications, labs, and physician notes.

20
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:13,735
Medical imaging makes up the bulk
of healthcare data by volume.

21
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:16,495
A single radiology
department may generate.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,730
A hundred thousand images daily.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:26,970
Genomic data sequencing costs have
dropped from 10,002,000 USD, but each

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,780
genome still adds 200 plus GB of data.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,930
Variables collect 10 to 20 biometric
points per second, generating

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,000
five to 15 MB daily per person.

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,420
That's a massive stream
of heterogeneous data.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,040
Right for EML, but challenging
for traditional infrastructures.

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,170
Three core challenges define this
space, data heterogeneity, and volume

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,120
and velocity and data quality issues.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,910
Let's go one by one and explore this
data heterogeneity structure, the

32
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,150
databases, free text notes, time
series, vitals, and images, all coexist.

33
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:13,775
About 80% of the unstructured and
meaning SQL alone won't cut it.

34
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:19,675
A single 300 bed hospital might generate
50 terabytes per year from EHRs.

35
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:20,185
ICU.

36
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,245
Monitor can emit 2000
plus readings per second.

37
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,135
Data quality issues.

38
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:29,275
For instance, smoking status
is missing in 60% of records.

39
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:32,065
Diagnosis codes vary between hospitals.

40
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,595
We need smart pipelines.

41
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:37,885
Fault tolerant systems and flexible
schemas to make sense of the chaos.

42
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:43,425
So here's where scalable data
frameworks enter Apache Spark provides

43
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:47,625
in-memory processing, idle for large
scale, batch and steam processing.

44
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:52,905
One provider reduce training time for
clinical models by 88% after moving

45
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,855
from disc based system to spark.

46
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:59,475
A W SEF supports petabytes, scale
queries and cost effective storage.

47
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,585
Your hospital in Germany reported
40 percentage of infrastructure

48
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,025
cost savings after migration.

49
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:08,265
OOP handle semi-structured
and unstructured data.

50
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:13,065
Your public health network used it
to integrate radiology scans and

51
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:18,045
clinical nodes from 10 plus hospital
enabling ML based triad support.

52
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,520
These platforms are the foundations
of model healthcare analytics.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,609
Cloud-based healthcare data
lakes, the traditional warehouses

54
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,470
force early schema decisions.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,730
But in healthcare where data types are
dynamic, we need schema on reflexibility.

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,859
Cloud-based Data Lakes solves
that the consulted structure and

57
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,359
unstructured sources supporting more
data formats than legacy systems.

58
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,269
One US network built a data lake that
combined imaging EHS and real telemetry.

59
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,005
Result.

60
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:55,695
The analytic pipelines that once
took days now run in another an hour

61
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:59,235
and dashboards refresh in real time.

62
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:02,765
The ETL process in healthcare
are in just about moving data.

63
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,755
They are about preserving clinical
meaning steps in encode extraction

64
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:11,695
from different systems, normalization,
using snowed CT loin and RX nom.

65
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:16,615
Data quality validation to catch
testing and inconsistent entries.

66
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,875
Transformation for models,
readiness and incremental loading.

67
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,695
To support the steaming
data efficient ETL.

68
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:29,095
Reduce pipeline latency from 2.5 days to
11 of us at one hospital, resulting in

69
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:31,105
realtime validating for critical care.

70
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,325
Is reshaping how clean
clinicians are making decisions.

71
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:40,815
A declining model for 30 day readmission
predicted achieved A A UC of 0.87

72
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,945
outperforming traditional models.

73
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:48,495
Disease risk models predicted diabetes
at 94.3% and heart disease at over

74
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:54,165
90% and various cancers with up
to 96% accuracy for deterioration.

75
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:54,705
Prediction.

76
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:58,515
LSTM networks trained on ICU
time series data flagged.

77
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,030
Patients decline six to 10 hours
earlier than manual methods hospital.

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,180
Using these tools are seeing fewer
readmissions, better outcomes,

79
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,550
and improved resource allocations.

80
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,260
Medical imaging is a
primary area for ml CNN.

81
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,870
Detect lung nodules on x-rays shows
sensitivity and specificity comparable

82
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,120
to the expert radiologist unit.

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,690
Architectures enable on our
typical segmentation, reducing

84
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,765
manual processing time by 60%.

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,900
In one pilot, a assistor radiology
system help clinicians detect

86
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,040
pneumonia and chest scans with a
9% boost in diagnostic accuracy.

87
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,110
These tool accelerate diagnosis
improvement precisions, and help

88
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,420
radiologists manage increasing workloads.

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,940
NLP helps us tap into rich
but messy free text data.

90
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,780
NLP engines extract structured
insights from discharge summaries.

91
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,255
Pathology reports and clinical notes.

92
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,085
Clinical trial matching platforms.

93
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:58,525
Now automate patient enrollment
using NLP, reducing switch times

94
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,195
by weeks, adverse event reduction.

95
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,365
Using NLP saw recall rates
jump up 28% in one hospital.

96
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:09,200
One model achieved F1 score, so over 0.90.

97
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,020
For extracting medication dosage
and side effect information.

98
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,000
This enables real time text analytics
that complement structure S, but

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,280
it's not solve smooth sailing.

100
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,840
There are some limited
implementation challenges for being.

101
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,505
Security and privacy.

102
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:33,345
Over 60 of healthcare breaches
stem from access control.

103
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,815
Misconfigurations, HIPAA demands,
multi-layer protection, encryption,

104
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,885
role-based access and audit logs.

105
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:41,265
Workflow integrations.

106
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:45,765
Doctors already spend two to three
hours on EHRs per hour for patient care.

107
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:50,535
Any tool must integrate seamlessly
into their workflows, ideally,

108
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:52,485
within existing systems.

109
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:55,305
Ethical oversight, we need transparency.

110
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,195
If a model denies care.

111
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:58,725
Our gives poor recommendation.

112
00:06:58,725 --> 00:06:59,685
We must know why.

113
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:04,335
This means explainable AI and clearly
defined accountability structures.

114
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:09,045
Engineering AI for healthcare means
building for trust, transparency,

115
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:13,385
and clinical usability, so to control
big data and mission learning or

116
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:18,785
transforming healthcare, but the success
on robust label and responsible systems.

117
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:21,695
And we are uniquely potent
to enable this future.

118
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:26,285
Ensuring performance at scale,
enforcing security, and keeping

119
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,445
patients outcome at the center.

120
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,005
Thanks for the time.
