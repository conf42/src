1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,260
Speaker 16: Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,220
My name is Neha Hana and I'm an
identity Solution architect at Harvard.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,390
In today's presentation, we will
be talking about identity access

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,690
management and privileged access
foundation for a C secure O

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,580
Enterprise machine learning platform.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,380
Throughout this presentation, if you
have any questions regarding this

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,700
video, please feel free to ping me on
LinkedIn and I will be happy to assist.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,590
So let's get started.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,960
In today's session, the topics which
you'll be covering will be around

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,950
identity lifecycle management,
which talks about provisioning, de

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,820
provisioning, and rule synchronization
with an authoritative source.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,800
Access governance practices, mostly
about certification campaign, the

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,110
role-based access and the compliance
alignment, privileged access management,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,070
which is all about securing the admin
accounts and the service accounts

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,480
in a machine learning platform.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,830
And in the end, an integrated IM
solution centralized governance with

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,170
platform like SailPoint Identity iq.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,330
Let's talk about the IM challenges
that are being currently faced

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,740
in the modern enterprises.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,550
As the organization grow, expand, and
scale their machine learning platform and

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:14,470
data intensive workloads, it has been seen
that the identity and access management

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,450
also becomes increasingly complex.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,015
From time to time.

24
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:22,095
This has been seen that traditional
security approaches struggle to keep

25
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:26,385
pace with this rapidly expanding
user population and service accounts.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,420
Growing regulatory environments in
healthcare and regulated industries,

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,330
complex data access patterns across our
machine learning pipeline and analytical

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,640
tools, elevated privileges needed for
automation and system administration.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,870
Besides that, some of the other
challenges being faced are like

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,670
access for that is uncontrolled
permissions across multiple platforms.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,490
Compliance risk, that is audit failures,
regulatory gaps, and privileged

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,815
exposure, which is like elevated
account with without proper controls

33
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:04,950
seen accessing them some resources or
system which they shouldn't be doing.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,229
Now let's talk about identity
lifecycle management.

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,620
The foundation of access control,
identity lifecycle management ensures

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,060
that access rights remain accurate
and aligned with job responsibilities

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,890
throughout an employee's tenure.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,930
Integration with authoritative
sources like HR system enables

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,220
automated provisioning.

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,150
When employees gets onboarded, that is
when they jog, join the organization.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,800
Role changes during internal
transfers, timely deprovisioning.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,090
That is when they leave the company,
the organization, and rehired.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,030
If the employee decides to come
back and rejoin the company.

44
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,350
This approach minimizes
the manual intervention.

45
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:49,195
Reduces the security gaps from the
often accounts and ensures a consistent

46
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:54,415
enforcement of access policies across
all data platform, analytical tool,

47
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,245
and machine learning infrastructure.

48
00:02:56,745 --> 00:03:00,975
Now let's dig a little bit deeper and
see how connecting IM to an authoritative

49
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:04,930
source can help in automating the
whole identity provisioning process.

50
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,515
Let's talk about some of the
identity lifecycle management events.

51
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:14,085
The first one being onboarding, which
is automatic account creation and role

52
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:18,825
assignment based on a person's job title
and department when they join a company.

53
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:23,775
Role changes, which is just the
access modification triggered by the

54
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:29,530
transfer, promotion, or responsibility
shift of an employee offboarding, the

55
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:34,005
immediate revocation of all access when
employment ends or the status changes.

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,810
And last but not the least, the rehire
scenario where, which talks about rehiring

57
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,100
an employee who previously have left the
organization then decided to come back,

58
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,650
which eventually resolves in reactivation
of their digital identity and access.

59
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,350
On the left hand side is a small
diagram showing how all this

60
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,790
automated identity provisioning can
be achieved once you connect an IM

61
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,225
system to an authoritative source.

62
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:05,885
Integration with HR system creates a
single source of truth for identity data,

63
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:10,475
enabling real time synchronization and
reduces the chances of manual errors.

64
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:16,000
Now let's move on to access governance and
certification, the regular access review.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,610
Access certification campaigns
are a critical control or part for

66
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,050
identifying and removing any excessive
or outdated permission, which an

67
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,890
employer and individual hold in the
current job title or responsibility.

68
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,159
By requiring managers and data owners to
periodically review and validate access

69
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:40,489
rights, organizations can detect privilege
creep and the dormant accounts and maybe

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,859
remove them if they are no longer needed.

71
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:47,995
Ensure lease privileges, privileged
principles are maintained, meet the

72
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:51,474
audit requirements and regulatory
requirements from time to time, and

73
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,575
also reduce the insider threat risk.

74
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:57,715
So in short, certifications are important.

75
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,234
Now let's talk about
role-based access model or RAC.

76
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:05,210
I'm pretty sure that we might
have heard about role-based

77
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,489
access control in our day-to-day.

78
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,769
Work life, but let's dig a little
bit deeper and try to understand

79
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,329
what exactly our back is.

80
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:19,509
RA simplifies the permission management
by linking access rights to job roles

81
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,309
instead of specific individuals.

82
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:26,669
This structure enhances organizational
consistency, cuts down on admin task

83
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,280
and strengthens compliance to career.

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Auditable access rate.

85
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,650
Below is an example of how.

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Different persons performing different
roles in the organization can be assigned

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,099
or are back, can be constructed out of it.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,640
For example, a data scientist who, which
who accesses, who assesses the machine

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,320
learning platform, models the training
environment and approve datasets.

90
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,535
The level of access required for a data
scientist will differ from a business

91
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:02,035
analyst whose day-to-day task is to
do some running, some analytical tools

92
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:04,255
and curating some reporting dashboards.

93
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,015
So maybe a read-only access
will suffice for them.

94
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:11,115
Let's talk about infrastructure
team, which perform more admin

95
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:15,495
access or admin level task to support
system with login and monitoring.

96
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:20,355
So an admin level access will be
helpful for them to perform these tasks.

97
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,585
So this is how.

98
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,150
A role-based access control or an
RA model can help you in assigning

99
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,530
correct permission by just assessing
the right or the job responsibilities

100
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,420
on individual hold in an organization.

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
Now let's move on to
privileged access management.

102
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,990
Protecting your most critical accounts.

103
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,740
Proficient accounts represents
the highest security risk in

104
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,300
any enterprise environments.

105
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,520
Admin accounts, service account,
supporting machine learning platforms and

106
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,650
pipelines and application credentials,
often hold elevated privilege permissions

107
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,830
that can expose sensitive models, data and
infrastructure if compromised or misused.

108
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,670
Privilege management provides specialized
control to secure these accounts through

109
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,560
credential vaulting, automated rotation,
session monitoring, and just in time.

110
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,349
Access, which is nothing but the
short time access with town time bound

111
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,659
elevation, and automatic revocation.

112
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,630
In this slide, we are going to
talk the core cam pam capabilities

113
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,280
for machine learning platform.

114
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,020
The credential vaulting storing
of privileged secrets in encrypted

115
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,469
worlds, eliminating hardcoded
credentials and reducing the exposure.

116
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,340
Password rotation automatically.

117
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,330
Change privilege credential on a
schedule basis to limit the window

118
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,069
of opportunity for the attackers.

119
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,150
Session.

120
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,069
Brokering proxy privilege sessions
without actually relieving or

121
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,479
revealing your credentials.

122
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:55,134
Enabling account playability and forensic
review activity, monitoring record and

123
00:07:55,134 --> 00:08:00,090
analyze privileged sessions to detect NLS
behavior and support compliance audits.

124
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:06,019
Now why is PAM or privileged access
management matters for a machine learning?

125
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,329
Let's try to understand this
machine learning environment.

126
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:14,149
Introduced unique privileged access
challenges from time to time.

127
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,779
Service accounts run
automated training jobs.

128
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:21,009
CICD pipelines, deploy models
to production and data engineers

129
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,639
manage infrastructure, supporting
petabytes of information.

130
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,229
Each of these accounts require
elevated permissions creating

131
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:29,939
potential attack for the vectors.

132
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,339
Palm controls ensure that these accounts
are properly managed, monitored,

133
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,709
and protected against any misuse.

134
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,809
On the left hand side, you can see some
of the points like model protection, which

135
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:44,949
is preventing the unauthorized access to
proprietary algorithms and training data.

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,019
The pipeline security, which is about
securing your automated workflows

137
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:55,299
and data pro transformation processes
and data set governance control, who

138
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:58,929
can modify or export the sensitive
training and validation data sets.

139
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,449
So in all this is why PAM is important or
privileged access management and important

140
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,979
when it comes to machine learning.

141
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,629
Now integrating IAM and PAM solution.

142
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:15,229
The most effective identity governance
program integrate, inter integrate.

143
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,659
Im governance with Pam Execution
layer to provide a unified visibility

144
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:26,059
policy enforcement, and auditability
across human and non-human identity.

145
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,639
In short, it provides you a single
governance view where you can manage

146
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,099
all identities under one platform,
unified certification, which is

147
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:39,639
about including your privileged
accounts and access reviews.

148
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,424
That is you can all, you can get your
service accounts, a admin, accounts

149
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:48,399
certified, and make sure the access which
they hold is correct from time to time

150
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,979
and consistent policy, which is applying
the same security standards everywhere.

151
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:58,649
Meeting of the regulatory requirements,
compliance and regulated industries,

152
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,529
healthcare and other industries regulated
industries have, or they face strict

153
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,939
requirements around data access,
audit rails, and identity governance.

154
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:12,409
The reason being these healthcare
industries hold tons of

155
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:17,419
P-H-I-N-P-I-I data, strict security
enforcement becomes important.

156
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,514
Designed, IEM and Pam programs directly
support compliance by providing

157
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:28,459
detailed audit logs, showing who can
access what data and what time regular

158
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,914
at tasks attestation that access.

159
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:34,544
Access rights are appropriate
and necessary, which is nothing

160
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,934
but just validating that whatever
the access currently you hold

161
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:41,294
are the correct, appropriate, and
do you really need that access.

162
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:45,334
Automated controls that enforce
separation of duties and lease

163
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:50,064
privileges, documentation of security
control for regulatory examination.

164
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:55,484
These capabilities help organization to
demonstrate compliance with HIPAA sox,

165
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:57,944
GTPN, and other regulatory frameworks.

166
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:02,794
So in the end, if we have to
sum up the all, we can see that

167
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:05,104
lifecycle management is essential.
