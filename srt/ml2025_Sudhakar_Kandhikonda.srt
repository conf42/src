00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,430
Hi my name is AK K with overall 18
years of IT experience specialized

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,010
in data engineering background.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,590
And I most of the time work with data.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,629
I would like to thank comp
42 Machine Learning 2025.

5
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:20,374
But giving me this opportunity
to speak in this conference.

6
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:25,265
So without much delay, let's
dive into AI unhinged fraud

7
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:26,824
detection in financial services.

8
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:32,155
This presentation explores the
implementation of an AI driven

9
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,425
fraud detection system at a
leading financial institution.

10
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:39,215
The solution integrates
diverse data sources.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,930
Applies sophisticated machine learning
algorithms and also enables real-time

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,620
transaction analysis through a
comprehensive cloud-based architecture.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,900
This transformation from traditional
rule-based detection to a adaptive

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,130
multi-layered framework, significantly
improved fraud prevention while

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,430
also enhancing customer experience.

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,060
Let's talk about the evolution
of financial fraud and also the

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,440
challenges that are being faced.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,160
During evolution there
are four main challenges.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,240
The first being high false fossil rates,
the second one being siloed data systems.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,220
Third one being significant
detection delays.

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,610
And the last one being
customer experience impact.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,055
These inefficiencies resulted in
annual fraud losses exceeding 25

23
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:35,150
million, and also deteriorating
customer satisfaction metrics.

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,000
According to research organizations
with siloed data systems, miss critical

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,390
connection patterns that could identify
27.4% of complex fraud scenarios,

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,320
Industry fraud landscape.

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,850
So there were around four areas where
you could see in this slide there

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,260
are four various areas where we have
focused for gathering some of the

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,290
metrics financial services, retail and
e-commerce, healthcare and government.

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:12,389
According to the Association of Certified
Fraud Examiners is EFE two in 2022

31
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,539
report to the nations organizations.

32
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:21,839
Lose an estimated 5% of revenue to fraud
each year, which translates to global

33
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,959
losses of approximately 4.7 trillion.

34
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,339
Financial services remain the most
targeted sector with the median

35
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:35,069
loss per case, reaching 1.5 million
and cases lasting an average

36
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,649
of 12 months before detection.

37
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,979
So you could see some of
the metrics that have been

38
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,809
highlighted across various areas.

39
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,669
Like annual fraud losses the median
loss per case, and what is the

40
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,899
average detection time, the areas
being financial services, retail and

41
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:54,089
e-commerce, healthcare and government,

42
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:58,039
Technical architecture, cloud
page, realtime analytics.

43
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,839
If you see here in this slide.

44
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,859
Around 1 67 0.3 milliseconds.

45
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,129
Average crossing time has been done
for the real time station engine.

46
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,989
And there were around 237
behavioral indicators analyzed

47
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,619
in machine learning pipeline.

48
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,059
And finally in the data integration
framework, there were around 17

49
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,859
disparate systems that were unified.

50
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,469
The solution leveraged cloud
infrastructure with 99.99% availability.

51
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:35,529
S. Elastic computing resources that could
scale from 5,230 to 25,004 70 transactions

52
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,329
per second during peak periods.

53
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:43,119
The A CFE report notes that organizations
implementing cloud-based analytics

54
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,849
solutions with real time monitoring.

55
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:52,824
Different fraud schemes and an
average of 33.2% faster than those

56
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:58,764
using on-premise legacy systems,
resulting in 47.8 lower media losses.

57
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:06,934
The data integration framework, there
were three main layers in this framework.

58
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,854
The first one is data
standardization layer.

59
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:14,754
The second one is Apache Kafka
Kafka Streaming, and the last

60
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,284
one being Data Lake Architecture.

61
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:21,754
The data integration framework unified
disparate systems including core

62
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:26,374
banking, credit card processing,
digital banking channels, and

63
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,144
customer relationship management.

64
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:33,544
This consolidation eliminated data
silos that previously concealed

65
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,284
critical fraud indicators.

66
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,454
Within the data standardization
layer we processed around 7,000 8 34

67
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:45,304
transactions per second with ETL pipelines
normalizing 14 different data formats

68
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:50,674
using 2 83 transformation rules and
maintaining 99.99 percentage accuracy

69
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,084
With the Apache Capish streaming we
deployed across 32 broker nodes with

70
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:59,564
42.7 millisecond average latency.

71
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:05,144
Managing 47 topic partitions
with 3.8 GB per second throughput

72
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:08,264
and 99.9% delivery guarantee.

73
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:14,194
Within the data lake architecture
we ingested close to 17.3 terabytes

74
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:20,104
daily while maintaining query response
times under 1.2 seconds for 98.7

75
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:24,334
percentage of analytical workloads
with 37 months of historical data.

76
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,019
The next slide talks about
machine learning pipeline.

77
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,859
There were four core areas the
first one being feature engineering.

78
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,919
The second one is a continuous retraining.

79
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,129
A third one we have ensemble modeling.

80
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,559
And last one being the annually detection.

81
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:49,434
So the ML pipeline represented the
analytical core of the fraud detection

82
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:53,754
system, leveraging advanced techniques
to identify suspicious patterns

83
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,644
across massive transaction volumes.

84
00:05:56,274 --> 00:06:00,564
The ensemble modeling approach
combined supervised learning algorithms

85
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:04,584
with unsupervised techniques for
comprehensive detection capabilities.

86
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,444
There were around 2 37
behavioral indicators across

87
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:10,884
transaction characteristics.

88
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:16,554
User behaviors, device attributes,
and network patterns within

89
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:17,754
the continuous retraining.

90
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:24,344
We had got a feedback loops from
270 3004 29, confirmed fraud cases

91
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:30,444
monthly with updates every eight
hours in the ensemble model, in the

92
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:35,964
ensemble modeling around six supervised
learning algorithms with many times.

93
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,869
Boost showing superior performance
around 94.7% precision.

94
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:46,059
And lastly, in the anomaly detection,
the multi layer approach, identifying

95
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:51,429
sat statistical outliers across
1 47 dimensions simultaneously,

96
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,809
This slide highlights about
the real time decision engine

97
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,249
the real time decision engine.

98
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:58,119
Sorry.

99
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:03,084
Transformed analytical insights into
actionable fraud prevention through a

100
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,774
high performance architecture capable
of millisecond level decisions.

101
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:12,084
This performance level enabled realtime
intervention before funds left the

102
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:19,494
institution in 94.7% of fraudulent
attempts compared to just 2.3

103
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:20,949
percentage with the previous systems,

104
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,889
Implementation results and.

105
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,509
The system demonstrated
remarkable implements across

106
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,799
key performance indicators.

107
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:34,344
Customer satisfaction scores improved
by 22.3 points on a hundred point

108
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:38,634
scale with the percentage of customers
reporting transaction friction

109
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,784
declining from 28.32 7.1 percentage.

110
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:48,234
Net promoter score recovered from
33 to 58, significantly exceeding

111
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,619
the ministry average of 45.

112
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:55,874
The, there were some of the
numbers that you could see here

113
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:59,434
some of the key performance index,
like the fraud detection rate.

114
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:05,054
It was increased from 65.3 percentage
exceeding industry average of 86.7

115
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:10,345
percentage, and the fall positive rate
decreased from to 3.7 percentage better

116
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,840
than industry average of 18.2 percentage.

117
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:19,025
And the detection time is close to
3.2 seconds, which reduced from 27.4

118
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:23,555
hours, enabling intervention before
funds left in 94.3 percentage of cases.

119
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:29,195
And finally, the annual fraud
retention by 19.7 million.

120
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:34,715
That represents a 78.8 percentage
improvement with 4 7 4 37

121
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:37,770
percentage ROA in the first year.

122
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
Implementation challenges.

123
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,350
We have three main, three major areas
where we face some of the challenges.

124
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,570
The first being data quality issues.

125
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,030
Legacy infrastructure comprised
27 distinct systems with 14

126
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,355
different data formats 23 timestamp
conventions, and nine incompatible

127
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,175
transaction classification schemes.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,200
Required 2 83 normalization rules
and 1 42 data quality checks to

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,680
achieve 99.9 percentage data accuracy.

130
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,620
And the other one is
the latency management.

131
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,240
Balancing processing time
with detection accuracy.

132
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,700
Required sophisticated parallel processing
across 1, 2 6 nodes, performing,

133
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,710
profiling identified 23 critical
bottleneck, reducing evaluation from four.

134
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:30,215
Milliseconds to 1 73 0.4 milliseconds
while also maintaining accuracy.

135
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:36,695
Model explainability regulatory
requirements across 17 jurisdictions

136
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:40,505
demanded clear justifications
for transaction declines.

137
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:45,545
Custom explainability framework
generated human readable explanations

138
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:51,305
with 97.3 percentage accuracy in
reflecting underlying model logic.

139
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,850
This slide highlights some of
the key technical innovations.

140
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,470
We have adaptive feature engineering.

141
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,280
We also have federated learning.

142
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,150
And the other one is grab
based network analysis.

143
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,120
In the adaptive feature engineering
we continuously generated new

144
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,300
features based on evolving
transaction patterns, evaluating.

145
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,885
70,000 4 23 potential indicators monthly.

146
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:20,655
And also identifying 37.2 significant
new features automatically

147
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:22,755
integrated into de detection modules.

148
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:29,025
Federated learning, enable
collaborative learning across

149
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,855
seven participating institutions.

150
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:32,865
Increasing fraud.

151
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:37,725
Example database from
two 70 3004 nine to 1.47.

152
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,980
While also maintaining strict data privacy
through secure multi-party computation.

153
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,510
Lastly, we have a graph based
network analysis within the

154
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,150
key technical innovations.

155
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,045
We have marked relationships between
four 7.2 million nodes connected by 83.7

156
00:10:56,045 --> 00:11:02,290
million edges identifying 34 previously
undetected fraud rings involving one three

157
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,655
accounts and 12.3 million in attempted.

158
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,525
Fraudulent transactions,

159
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:08,985
Future directions.

160
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,465
There are four core areas
for the future directions.

161
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:17,675
The first one being behavioral
biometrics integration of typing

162
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:22,205
patterns, device handling and
interactions patterns to achieve 94.3

163
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,455
percentage accuracy in distribution.

164
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:26,680
Legitimate users from IM posters.

165
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,910
Also expected to detect 92.7
percentage of account takeover

166
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,630
attempts with just 0.37 false postures.

167
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,970
The second core area is
voice pattern analysis.

168
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,480
Natural language processing to
analyze 73 voice characteristics

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,860
for detecting social engineering
attempts in customer service channels

170
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,050
with 87.3 percentage identification
rate of social engineering attempts.

171
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:59,085
The third one being cross
channel correlation.

172
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:03,715
Enhanced detection of fraud patterns
spanning multiple channels by analyzing

173
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:08,365
transaction sequences across an
average of 3.7 different channels per

174
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:13,075
customer, identifying 42.7 percentage
more sophisticated fraud attempt.

175
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:19,215
And lastly, we have quantum
resistant crypto implementation

176
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:23,385
of NISG standardized algorithms,
including crystals, cyber, and.

177
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,080
Lithium to protect against
future quantum computing threats

178
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
to current encryption methods.

179
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,630
With this we have come to, and and for the
presentation this is what I have for a and

180
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,090
h fraud detection in financial services.

181
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,020
I would like to thank once again
the comp 42 machine learning.

182
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,585
Giving me this opportunity to connect
with you all and hope to see you

183
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:53,035
and talk you again in the future.

184
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:53,995
Thank you all.
