00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,190
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:03,250
My name is Pavan Moti.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,180
So I am a senior technical lead at
Oracle Corp. And so today my topic is

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,329
basically we'll discuss about quantum
computing and then how it impacts on

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:16,809
the cloud security and then how we
should be prepared for that actually.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,080
This would be my topic.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,970
Now for many years quantum computing
was some, something we thought as far

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,280
off like maybe 10 or 20 years away.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,630
But that's no longer true.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,090
Quantum computing is moving from theory
of reality very quickly, and as it

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,920
does, it poses some serious risk to the
cryptographic foundations we rely on

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,080
today to protect the cloud environments.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,575
So this talk is really about
how we can start preparing now.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,220
Before, the quantum computing
starts breaking the encryption,

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,580
like today's standard encryption,
and it exposes the sensitive data.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,700
So first of all, what is
quantum computing, right?

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,580
So let's dig in little
more detail in that.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,960
So quantum computing operates
using quantum bits or the,

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,520
it's called Q bits also.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,930
So unlike classic bits which you
know, are zero on zero or one.

21
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,305
Qubits can be both zero
and one at the same time.

22
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:13,265
It's because of the property called super
position, so they can also be entangled,

23
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:18,065
meaning that the state of one qubit can
be linked to another, allowing for highly

24
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:21,755
parallel processing, extremely fast
computation for certain type of problems.

25
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:24,605
Now, why does that matter for security?

26
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:28,145
Because quantum computers
can run algorithms that are

27
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,375
fundamentally different.

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,940
And far more powerful
than the classic ones.

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,470
Let's take an example.

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,330
Short algorithm, right?

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,740
And it allows quantum computer to
factor large prime numbers exponentially

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,090
faster than the classic computers.

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,240
And this threatens RSA
and then ECC encryption.

34
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,510
This is basically the public key
cryptography views everywhere.

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,880
It's ubiquitous in the cloud systems.

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,520
So another example would
be the Grover algorithm.

37
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:56,154
The it can also get weakened by
the symmetric encryption, right?

38
00:01:56,395 --> 00:02:00,085
So in short, quantum computing's
game changer for cryptography.

39
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:04,925
Now let's let's look at specifically
how quantum computing threatens

40
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:06,725
today's cloud environments.

41
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:11,165
So today's cloud security lies
heavily on R-S-N-E-C-C, for public

42
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,495
reintroduction, for identity
key exchange, TLS, everything.

43
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:18,295
A sufficient, powerful quantum
computer code use short solid rhythm

44
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:24,435
to crack RSA 2 0 4 right in minutes,
completely breaking these protections.

45
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,085
The is the quantum, the cloud-based
quantum computing market is

46
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:34,095
expected to be worth around like
$4 billion by in, in few years.

47
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,484
So we are actually in 2023.

48
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:39,334
It's this seven 98 million by
2028 in a couple of years, it's

49
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,285
gonna grow exponentially higher.

50
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:45,645
So we discussed about the, like the
quantum computing we discussed about what

51
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:49,305
the qubits are and then how it enables the
massive pallet processing and all that.

52
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:49,825
Yeah.

53
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:53,755
So now let's talk about like how
the quantum computing threatens

54
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,275
the cloud security, right?

55
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:59,060
There are like three key risks
I want to highlight, one is

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,410
breaking publicly encryption.

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,590
Today's cloud secure lies heavily
on RSA and and EC for public

58
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,930
publicly encryption, for identity
keys exchange, TLS, everything.

59
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,040
So as a sufficient, powerful quantum
computer could use short algorithm

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,870
to crack, like I said, that like
the 2 0 4 8 in minutes, right?

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,040
And then also it weakens the Semitic
encryption system again, like I've given

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,660
an example about the Grover algorithm.

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,840
How it gets how it gets weakened.

64
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,620
And then also there is the third
thing, harvest nav and decrepit later.

65
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,690
So this is the very scariest part.

66
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,120
Attackers are already stealing encrypt
data, knowing what, when quantum

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,810
computers become called powerful enough,
they'll be able to decrepit later.

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,255
So long-term sensitive data like health,
healthcare records, financial data,

69
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,360
government secrets, they're all at risks.

70
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,420
And then also the D cert.

71
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,130
The report says that 61% or more than
60% of our organizations are worried

72
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,680
about this, and this is with good reason.

73
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Now how do we prepare for
quantum computing security?

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,820
So what can we do about it?

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,570
So there, here are the
five key strategies, like I

76
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,310
want to show showcase here.

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,250
The most promising long-term solution is.

78
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:14,775
The new cryptographic to come
up with a new cryptographic

79
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:18,195
algorithms that are resistant to
both classic and quantum attacks.

80
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:24,905
So in 2022 NIST selected four algorithms,
the crystal cuber for key exchanges,

81
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:30,275
crystal's, digital lithium, falcon,
and spinx for digital signatures.

82
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,245
So these are all part of
post quantum cryptography.

83
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:36,605
Like there's a new cryptographic
algorithms that we should, that

84
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:37,595
the industry should embrace.

85
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:42,355
As opposed to the the classic algorithms
to prevent from the quantum attacks.

86
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,745
And the second one is basically
the quantum key distribution.

87
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:48,985
This is a more exotic
but very secure approach.

88
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:52,315
Using quantum mechanics itself
is secure exchange keys.

89
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:56,095
Any attempts to eves drops can
be detected because measuring

90
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,745
a quantum state changes it.

91
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:02,965
QKD is still limited, high cost limited
range, but promising for defense,

92
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,255
finance and government sectors.

93
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:08,545
And the third one is basically
using hybrid cryptographic systems.

94
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:12,325
So in the near term, the best
path is to combine traditional

95
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,895
and quantum safe algorithms.

96
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,525
It's basically allowing backward
compatibility while also

97
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,845
gaining stronger production.

98
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,905
So Microsoft and Google are
already testing this, for example.

99
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:25,955
Kyber plus traditional Ts in
Chrome and Azure environments.

100
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:29,735
The fourth is basically the
cloud vendor initiatives, right?

101
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,985
Some major cloud providers
are taking steps.

102
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:35,645
Azure offers quantum safe,
VPN options, IBM Cloud.

103
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,545
I think they're te still in the testing
phase for post quantum algorithms.

104
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:43,205
And AWS already provides a
lot of cryptographic inventory

105
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,825
tools and migration guidance.

106
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,005
So basically partnership
with cloud vendors is key.

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,120
Quantum readiness will increasingly be co.
It'll be increasingly co differentiated.

108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,350
So the fifth point is
basically the cryptographic

109
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,910
inventory and risk assessment.

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,110
This is very critical.

111
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,010
Organizations need to identify
where encryption is used, what

112
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,250
key and are in place, and where
the sensitive data is reside.

113
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,880
Long, long term data systems
like healthcare financial should

114
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,690
be prioritized for updates, and
then also zero test architecture.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,520
We'll also help reusing if there
are any certain productions

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
which are weak or broken.

117
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,140
So we discussed about
all these five points.

118
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,320
Now let's talk about like how
to prepare for quantum post

119
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,580
quantum computing security.

120
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,620
Like we discussed this five points.

121
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,660
So now let's talk about the challenges.

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,820
So this transition is not easy.

123
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,020
There are three big challenges.

124
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,040
One is compatibility.

125
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,190
The migration cost and risk of inaction.

126
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,280
And for with respect to com compatibility,
like many quantum safe algorithms don't

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,920
work well with legacy systems and devices.

128
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,610
And then also migration cost also
it will be significant investment.

129
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,320
And then, the risk of inaction
is much higher than than like

130
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,700
the potential migration cost.

131
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,330
So basically the average cloud
breach already cost like around

132
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,740
like $4.4 million straight.

133
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:02,465
Okay, so once quantum attacks are
practical, that could skyrocket.

134
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,485
So doing nothing is the riskiest choice.

135
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:08,545
So what is the path forward?

136
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:13,100
So here are the practical steps every
cloud aligned organization should take.

137
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:16,130
Now the first is basically
like we discussed, like the

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,990
implement hybrid encryption.

139
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,480
Then also monitor the ISD standards.

140
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:25,515
And IS you this and stay current,
like with the as this post quantum

141
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,015
computing algorithms mature.

142
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,715
And then also please collaborate
with your cloud vendors such as

143
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:34,225
your AWS, Microsoft and IBM, and
then also conduct crypto audits.

144
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:40,165
So quantum computing, again,
is no longer a science fiction.

145
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,160
It's coming.

146
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,145
And then cloud security teams
need to start preparing now

147
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:46,705
to stay ahead of the curve.

148
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:47,195
Yeah.

149
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:51,545
So to wrap up so we are on the
verge of quantum computing era

150
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,915
and quantum era in the computing.

151
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:59,405
So this brings enormous potential, but
also significant risk to the security

152
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,145
foundations of today's cloud environment.

153
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,275
So by starting now through
hybrid encryption crypto

154
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,235
audits, cloud partnerships, and
zero trust, it can be ready.

155
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,455
Quantum resilience will be a key pillar.

156
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,570
Of cloud security in the thank
you and if you have any questions,

157
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,620
please reach out to me or my email.

158
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,070
Thank you.
