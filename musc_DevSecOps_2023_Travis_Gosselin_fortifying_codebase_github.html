                We're focusing on fortifying your code base with GitHub specifically. The session focuses specifically on developer experience. Effective documentation is so important. Developers code on average 52 minutes a day. We need to make that 52 minutes longer and better.

                GitHub Dependabot monitors vulnerabilities and dependencies used in your project. Over 90% of cves aren't present in most recent dependency versions. The single best security practice is to keep your packages up to date all the time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GitHub has a dependency graph that maps all of these supply chain dependencies. By enabling the dependent bot alerts, you can see what dependencies are used across your entire organization. But a word of warning, as you begin to turn on and play with these features, that's the security updates alerts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Dependabot now allows version updates to move into source control. One of the largest additions is the ability to handle grouped pull requests. This is essential for the effectiveness and the productivity of dependent.

                GitHub advanced security is a feature that is all about thinking about the practices around your own code security. It gives you access to code scanning and secret scanning. It's important you know that this is a paid portion of the ecosystem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code scanning allows you to include a number of tools. It executes on your pull requests. The best part about code scanning is that it actually creates an annotation on your code. What makes code scanning so great?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code scanning is the framework, right? It acts as a user interface that we can interact with. The queries that it runs are also open source queries that you can find on GitHub today. But the key is that whatever tool you're using, each of them are going to execute differently.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So that's all the time that we have for today. Thanks for checking out this talk on fortifying codebase with GitHub. I hope these two tools are something you're able to take advantage of. Let's continue to work towards this centralized ecosystem.
