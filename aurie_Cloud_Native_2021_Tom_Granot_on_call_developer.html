                Tom Granot is a developer advocate working for Lightrun. Previously worked as a site reliability engineer for Actix in Munich, Germany. Talk focuses on getting back to sleep as soon as possible for the on call developer.

                Jamie is a Java developer with about five years of experience working for the enterprise application company that produces Oasis. Jamie works on the transaction system inside the application that is in charge of allowing users to purchase various things. On call always brings new challenges. The best situation with a running system is a situation of observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's another subset of tooling called exception or error monitoring and handling tooling. These tools enable you to get a better grasp when things go bad. But the more interesting part is talking about what our tools don't tell you. Examples include incorrect application state and races.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A customer complained about an error in a small application. It took the engineer a few minutes to investigate. The problem was how to make a system observable. The best way to define this new practice is continuous observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A good postmortem is composed of information from all the different teams. Having them enables you to solve the problems much quicker. There's also this kind of humility that developers should take here. If there's something that relates to the underlying infrastructure, ask questions.
