              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Trickram is a cloud security architect for Checkpoint in the UK and Ireland. He will discuss what the cloud threat landscape looks like in 2021. He won't be talking about any technology or pitch any of checkpoint's solutions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It varies very much depending on the type, the size and the maturity of the customer that we're talking to. Different businesses have very different priorities. One day I'll be talking to one at the entry level public cloud, the next day it might be a cloud expert.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In public cloud, people are exposed to the same types of threats, and it's just maybe in a different order. Depending on your maturity in the public cloud and where you are with your level of service adoption, you're going to face different things differently.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of people see cloud as the fix all solution. Taking non cloud workloads and putting them into cloud can lead to other problems. They want to reduce cost potentially, or be more cost effective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We've got customers who have only ever used public cloud and only ever want to use public cloud. These types of customers have very different demands, and it's all about the native tools. People are increasingly more interested in consuming APIs to automate deployment into cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are still a large number of people out there who don't know cloud. They're not experienced with cloud. Moving to cloud, moving to an unknown environment, is scary and a risk.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the first barriers and threats when it comes to cloud is the speed of changes. There will be dozens of changes daily, if not hundreds a day. Then you've got the shift in focus of who's in control in these environments. The developer is the new person responsible overall for these types of things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of what happens in cloud and cloud architectures and cloud deployments is purely code based now. This is something which is quite lacking and leaving everything up to the development teams. There are some very thorough approaches to security when it comes to cloud deployments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of the failures in public cloud are going to be down to the users. Through 2025, up to 99% of cloud security failures will be on the user, says Gartner. The biggest problems that we see with this is agility and visibility.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Commercial offerings are available on the visibility side of things. Make sure you're making the best use of what native tools you've got available. If you haven't got any visibility of what's going on, things are going to be rough. Then misconfiguration is such an obvious thing to happen.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make sure at least to get the bare minimum covered and then on to IAM. There are numerous tools in the platforms, each of them are very diverse and very different. It is a worthwhile investment to get these right, because they can save you a lot of pain and suffering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Not everyone is a cloud expert. Businesses are very different levels when it comes to cloud adoption. Don't look too unkindly on people who are new to cloud. There's no right or wrong.
              </li>
