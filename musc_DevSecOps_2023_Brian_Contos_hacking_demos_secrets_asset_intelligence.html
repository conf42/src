              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Brian Kantos: Today we're talking about asset intelligence, dirty secrets, dangerous lies, and some hacking demos. He says think about it in four dimensions: length, breadth, height and time. Any type of asset type can fall into that category.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For the sake of this presentation, we're primarily going to be focusing on XioT, or extended Internet of things. There's almost 5 million Internet accessible cameras, almost 14,000 UPS systems. You can't run endpoint security on these guys.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                About 50% of all the passwords on XioT devices are default. End of life firmware kicks in at about 25%. The remaining 74% of devices are about six years old. Devices can be exploited remotely with little to no effort to gain full administrative access.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's actually a really interesting attack that came out last year called RSOCs. It was interesting because they weren't actually looking at traditional XioT. They were primarily focused on OT. These attacks still happen, but it's definitely not the big, interesting piece of Xiot attacks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The line between nation states and cybercriminals is often blurred. These tools are commonly used for those physical type attacks. Another type of attack are OEm attacks. These are attacks that it's not malware, they just ship maliciously out of the box.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A popular example of this is called Quiet Exit. This is gaining access to your environment via one mechanism and then using Xiot on the backend. Most cases, though, people didn't even realize that they had been compromised. There is a threat window of 18 to 24 months before CSO's figure out that this is happening.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kali Linux is a great platform to use for exploitation of security cameras. There are about three and a half million of these cameras worldwide. We can download files directly to the camera. And we can do anything from crypto mining to password crackers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next one and last one I want to show you is hacking industrial robots. If you can get access to these devices, you can actually steal the intellectual property. What can we learn by logging into a web server running on a robot with absolutely no security?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fenuc robots often ship with no security controls, no authentication. It's very easy to get that intellectual property and with very basic skills. You want to make sure that if you're making a modification, you add it to the default program.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's solutions out there today called asset intelligence platforms. They feed into your vulnerability management solutions. If you'd like to try out one of these solutions for free, you can poc the whole thing in 60 minutes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hacking in the XioT world isn't that complicated, just some very basic steps and maneuvering. All Linux servers are not managed, they typically don't have good passwords, and they're typically running old firmware. I hope you enjoyed the presentation. See you next time.
