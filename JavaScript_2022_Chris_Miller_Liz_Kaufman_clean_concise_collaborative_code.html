    <meta property="og:description" content="I have worked in the industry on and off since the year 2000.  I now teach code at The School Of Code.  I have a passion for seeing code that is at it's best and the most friendly for every skill level, whilst still maintaining effectiveness and completeness.  This talk has been given in the PHP world several times, and each time this has prompted strong discussion around the definitions of how this might look in practice."/>

<p>I have worked in the industry on and off since the year 2000.  I now teach code at The School Of Code.  I have a passion for seeing code that is at it&rsquo;s best and the most friendly for every skill level, whilst still maintaining effectiveness and completeness.  This talk has been given in the PHP world several times, and each time this has prompted strong discussion around the definitions of how this might look in practice.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Jamaica real time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems. Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with confidence, but respond instantly to get things working again. Liz Kaufman asks Chris Miller six questions about clean, concise, collaborative code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is your plan extensive enough to help someone else? Is your code abstracted enough to minimize load? And is your code clear enough that a nondeveloper can understand it? Which is a scary question, which is why I put it at the end.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A plan is looking at the flow that you're going to take in the code. Do the logic first, and then layer on the code after you've got that plan. Is the path clear enough with every step planned?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We put a lot of emphasis at the school of code on pairing and on making sure that the plan is good enough for everybody. A senior can often forget that there are certain things that a junior might not know and conversely, a junior can come up with some brilliant ideas. In a modern tech environment, employers want people who can do this planning process.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is your code abstracted enough to minimize load? Do you think that that carries through to code? Is there a time where you can over abstract or under abstract?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So sort of tied into abstraction is the idea of encapsulation. All data should be in a single class that needs to be there. All related things should be easily identifiable. No data inaccessible should be needed. And also in terms of swap. I'd like to think of it as like swap ability as plug and play.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is your code tested enough to be confident? The more your best resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. Keeping that user at the center will set you right, not have you bogged down into the weeds.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is your code documented enough to be helpful? What do you think documentation should look like? The sweet spot differs for each tool. There's been a good industry shift toward more friendly documentation. It's important for future you, not just other people.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For me, documentation tells you how to get set up and what the code does. But it doesn't need to tell you line by line what each specific thing is doing. I like function names that should say what they do in verb tense and present tense. Testing gives you a leg up on documentation and using conventions like calling things actual.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is your code clear enough that a non developer can understand? Because developers are not in silos anymore. Putting that user at the center will make the lives of your fellow developers so much easier. We want people to have easy, blissful lives.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you were hit by a bus tomorrow, could anybody else pick up your work? If the answer is no, perhaps it's time to revisit some of your code. The panacea of code that can be run by anybody.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Liz: Why does clean, collaborative coding matter? Chris: I think it matters because, like I said before, coding is hard. Let's have that rule of leaving the code better than when you found it. If you want to know more about the school of code, please head to school of.
