    <meta property="og:description" content="Kubernetes has become the new darling of the infrastructure world. Not only is it a great piece of technology for managing your containers, but in conjunction with the possibility to rent managed clusters from any of the big Cloud providers, Kubernetes offers organisations the possibility to get rid of the shackles of hosting and/or managing one’s infrastructure.  But that does not mean that Kubernetes is a one-size-fits-all solution. Especially in big corporations, bigger, systemic and/or more pressing problems could be revealed while implementing a big shift like moving to the cloud. As consultants, we can often observe the chaos and frustration that breaks out, when the vision of management does not align with the reality of what the teams are able to deliver. More often than not, it’s not a technological problem, but a cultural one.  When is an organisation ripe for cloud transformation? How can we make sure we are addressing the problems at their root?  Kubernetes alone won’t save you, but with the right mindset, it might be just what you needed to save yourself."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Kubernetes has become the new darling of the infrastructure world. Not only is it a great piece of technology for managing your containers, but in conjunction with the possibility to rent managed clusters from any of the big Cloud providers, Kubernetes offers organisations the possibility to get rid of the shackles of hosting and/or managing one’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>But that does not mean that Kubernetes is a one-size-fits-all solution. Especially in big corporations, bigger, systemic and/or more pressing problems could be revealed while implementing a big shift like moving to the cloud. As consultants, we can often observe the chaos and frustration that breaks out, when the vision of management does not align with the reality of what the teams are able to deliver. More often than not, it’s not a technological problem, but a cultural one.</p>
<p>When is an organisation ripe for cloud transformation? How can we make sure we are addressing the problems at their root? 
Kubernetes alone won’t save you, but with the right mindset, it might be just what you needed to save yourself.</p>

            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Lian Li is a cloud native engineer and engineering manager at Container Solutions in Amsterdam. We are a consultancy focused on programmable infrastructure. I'm also one of the organizers for serverless days Amsterdam. If you're interested in checking out what this is about, then let me know.

              <li>
                Bad news, serverless won't save you either. Why? Because it's not about technology, it's about your culture. It's about adapting to change, building trust and resilience in your organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubernetes is a containers orchestration platform. It has become popular in the last couple of years because it providers to make infrastructure tasks easier to automate. Kubernetes has become mainstream. And that is both kind of good and kind of bad. There are two aspects why cloud native transformations sometimes fail.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is cloud native? Who has good explanation, please put it in the chat or on Twitter. To me, it's kind of at the intersection of culture, people and technology. This is something that we call the cloud native maturity matrix.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Not all companies will use tech like AI or kubernetes, simply because everyone is doing it. In my mind, tech is a byproduct of solving a problem. Most companies don't need to manage their own cluster but somehow have begun to. Ask yourself whether the tech is still contributing to your core business.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A solution is only as good as your framing of the problem. Most companies now follow agile principles of failing fast and early and often. If you want to have this cycle of continuous failure, but not burn out your employees, then you need to create a culture that encourages failing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The factor of collaboration obviously is also very, very important now because everything is distributed. You really need to put a lot of effort into streamlining your collaboration now. Our cloud native transformation kit consists of a bunch of patterns to move your application to a cloud native state.
