                Digital transformation seems to be on the top of everyone's minds. There is no single tool that will allow you to digitally transform your business. Every single business is unique. What it is not a failure of microservices is how you apply it to a particular problem.

                Disney has done a ton of work in the digital transformation sphere. Casey's has gone through a rebranding and they're looking holistically at all the different aspects of their business. They chose Salesforce for their digital transformation.

                Software development team is responsible for delivering the digital transformation. We have to understand that a user is at the heart of everything that we do. The earlier you can have product owners and architects involved in the process, the better the project will be.

                Zach Gardner: I want to help solve people's process through software. Software is one of those unique fields that allows us to do things that we thought potentially were impossible. We owe it to our customers to stop thinking about things in the way that we used to.
