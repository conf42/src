    <meta property="og:description" content="Case study of building Operations Team in MakoLab that covers both DevOps and Maintenance&Support area in 24/7. There is no standard scope of DevOps activities. Every project, environment, deployment model is different. DevOps is evolving and responding to more and more project needs. Extended DevOps, where activities (and thus competencies), are diversified can be the answer to the challenges of the future. Answer is to combine multiple activities in a single team, ensuring both technical balance and the ability to quickly support new technologies and diverse projects."/>

<p>Case study of building Operations Team in MakoLab that covers both DevOps and Maintenance&amp;Support area in 24/7.
There is no standard scope of DevOps activities. Every project, environment, deployment model is different. DevOps is evolving and responding to more and more project needs. Extended DevOps, where activities (and thus competencies), are diversified can be the answer to the challenges of the future. Answer is to combine multiple activities in a single team, ensuring both technical balance and the ability to quickly support new technologies and diverse projects.</p>

                Grzegorz Sztandera is a case study of building operations team at Makolab. For last three years he effectively and efficiently built area of DevOps operations. Extending classic DevOps approach in multidimensional operations that boost up projects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Makolab's operations team is able to provide the full scope of DevOps operations, maintenance and support services. In case of need they can plug in into the project or into the customer environment, perform the tasks and then switch off.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When I came to Makolab three years ago, I had a team of three persons. In 2021, at the end of 2022, we had ten people on board. From one to ten within two years. I was recruiting mostly junior and regular DevOps engineers, each in different specialty. Looking on personality more than technical skills.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How to integrate the remote team? I joined during the pandemic for building this team. We work on a daily basis with each other. We have a trust for each other inside the team. This process is critical for delivering the high quality and being able to scale up very quickly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Macaulay: The most important things that I believe drives us to the point that we are and being able to rapidly expand the operations team. The personality at the very beginning is more important for the team success than technical level. Small teams of course are more flexible and are being more able to be integrated.
