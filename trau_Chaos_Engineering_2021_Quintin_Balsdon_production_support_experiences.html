            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Quintin Balsdon is an Android developed. Has been working in London since 2017. Has supported a number of different applications, from startups to long running apps. Hopes to create an environment of understanding and communication.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Everybody should be involved with production support. If people aren't involved, they tend not to understand the nuances of the infrastructure. The more we get involved, the less we actually have to do it. It's very important that we see both the positive side and negative sides of supporting a production application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Learning from how other companies respond to problems can be really, really useful. When going into a production support call, it is so important that we lose those agendas. You want to ensure that these elements are always maintained, the perceptions and your reputation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Questions can be asked because of three great reasons. We need the answer. Sometimes we ask questions because asking is important. Someone taking you through how they came to the end result can yield the best result. But don't use questions as a mechanism of intimidation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to be careful with reports that you know how to read in between the lines. Just having one report is just not good enough. Management is having one communication tool. Communication is your biggest asset, but it can also be your biggest detractor.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The temptation is to bypass code review and bypass testing in the name of an immediate fix. When you take a risk like that, you're taking it on behalf of the entire organization. There are times when you just need to leave the problem there.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need to take down time to look after ourselves. You want to create very, very distinct boundaries of what you're prepared to do. Those boundaries need to be effectively communicated, especially when it comes to taking time off.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the things I would really encourage is doing wash ups. It allows you to communicate that you understood the problem. Also important to check your merging and release strategy. Having release notes can be very telling.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Having the buddy system employed on your support team is the best decision you can make. Making sure that people have access to the numbers they need to call to the right teams. Schedule management is not just about having a calendar in place, it's about connecting, collaborating and communicating.
              </li>
