    <meta property="og:description" content="The development of Quantum-Inspired Algorithms has emerged as a promising approach to unlock quantum benefits in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing. With the current limitations of NISQ devices in terms of qubit coherence and error rates, quantum-inspired algorithms offer a bridge between classical and quantum computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance computational performance on existing hardware.

<p>The development of Quantum-Inspired Algorithms has emerged as a promising approach to unlock quantum benefits in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing. With the current limitations of NISQ devices in terms of qubit coherence and error rates, quantum-inspired algorithms offer a bridge between classical and quantum computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance computational performance on existing hardware. </p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                The session will discuss quantum s pad algorithms as a means of harnessing quantum advantage in Niscara. There will be two components to the whole session. One is the presentation deck, and the other is the notes deck. Both will be provided to you after the session.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We'll be talking about quantum and SpAd algorithms as a means of harnessing quantum advantage in Nescara or quantum computing. Nisq is noise intermediate scale quantum. The computers which we have right now are prone to error. They are not that much scalable.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In quantum computing, we have a concept called qubits. If I'm adding one qubit to this whole system, I'm basically doubling my computing capacity. This is where we see the potential of quantum computers to be able to solve complex problems. But scalability is one of the major limitations of current hardware.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are talking about 120 usable qubits. That is like more or less the upper limit, which we have right now. Any algorithms which you will develop right now on quantum hardware or quantum architecture will have certain limits. And those limits are very hard, and those limits do not scale well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The second aspect, or let's say one of the second issues which we have in the whole quantum computing thing, is noisy qubits. Over time, due to decoheration interference or through outside interference of material, they lose their potential state. This leads to loss of information.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Say we have different particles, but all those particles behave exactly the same. They don't show any kind of variability. That becomes an circumstance, sort of like an issue on the hardware side of things, to be honest.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every quantum hardware is basically a quantum system. There is a limitation of the connectivity between the qubits. This won't become an issue to you, like in the initial phases of, what do you call your planning. But it becomes an issue later.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 quantum AspAd algorithms are algorithms which simulate some quantum mechanics principles to get performance benefit. When we say quantum has bad algorithms, we are talking about the algorithms.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 quantum inspired algorithms are meant to run on a quantum hardware. But because the hardware is still in the budding stage, we are just simulating them on a classical hardware. We are considering quantum inspired for its scalability aspect and still being able to deliver some performance benefit.

                Quantum computing uses certain properties of quantum mechanics. The very first is parallelism, or means, as I like to call it, parallelism or superposition. For any coin, we have two possible end states, heads and tails. Any qubit should follow this principle.

                A coin has two possible end states, heads or tails. In quantum computing, we take benefit of the possibility of this particle to exist in state of in between, say, zero and one. This is what we call superposition.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Superlation is basically using two to the power n possible states simultaneously for a given function. Quantum tunneling is more prone or focused towards your quantum annealing concepts. Make the IC chip larger or smaller, make it possible to improve hardware.

              <li>
                Quantum inspired algorithms are in some sense, example of your quantum inspired algorithms. These algorithms, as I like to call them, are also quantum ready. That would mean that you can run these algorithms on actual quantum hardware as well.

              <li>
                One of my personal favorite being quantum inspired optimization algorithms. In evolutionary algorithm, you can have a number of algorithms. The biggest bottleneck here is the computational resources for genetic algorithms or for evolutionary algorithms.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 quantum inspired algorithms provide an immediate solution of harnessing the advantages of quantum computers. But there are some limitations of quantum inspired as well. One of the problems which I used to face is that if this is not scalable, why are we even going with it?
