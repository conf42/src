    <meta property="og:description" content="AI has started to scratch the surface when it comes to deciding the future of observability. But it’s a long strenuous journey ahead as the technology is handicapped without the much-needed guidance of the DevOps and the SRE (observability) folks.  In the next few years, the observability’s future will be determined by shrewd IT teams prepping their systems and software by collecting, streamlining, and optimising the data (metrics, logs and traces) for the much-hyped AI-driven world. Troubleshooting and securing applications will get tougher as applications get heavy and complex with changing business needs, and as the experience economy kicks in.  What does this mean to DevOps and SRE teams? This talk will discuss what vendors and IT teams ought to do in preparing for an experience economy."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>AI has started to scratch the surface when it comes to deciding the future of observability. But it’s a long strenuous journey ahead as the technology is handicapped without the much-needed guidance of the DevOps and the SRE (observability) folks.</p>
<p>In the next few years, the observability’s future will be determined by shrewd IT teams prepping their systems and software by collecting, streamlining, and optimising the data (metrics, logs and traces) for the much-hyped AI-driven world. Troubleshooting and securing applications will get tougher as applications get heavy and complex with changing business needs, and as the experience economy kicks in.</p>
<p>What does this mean to DevOps and SRE teams? This talk will discuss what vendors and IT teams ought to do in preparing for an experience economy.</p>

              <li>
                Conf 42 SRE conference focuses on future of observability in an experience driven economy. What are the differences and what is DevOps SRE and what does observability do with them? And how can tools help in achieving observability?

                Sustained success lies with successful users. If you want successful users, user experience is important. User experience plays a major role as a differentiating factor if you want to stay ahead of your competition. 89% of companies have adopted digital first strategy and 86% believe cloud technology is critical for digital transformation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is observability and how is it different from monitoring? Is monitoring and observability the same or are there any differences? Then you can do monitoring and then you have to do analysis on top of it. But analysis is important.

                DevOps is transforming to Devsec Ops, where security at all layers are important. With digital adoption, we are moving to an era of deploying multiple builds within the same day. DevOps people need to make use of tools to solve problems easily.

              <li>
                If DevOps is about principles of what to be done, SRE is about how you do things. SRE are the more ops oriented and they are more towards the production environment. They are to do with the reliability of the systems and particularly things when it is in the cloud. End to end visibility of all these layers is important.

                The three pillars of observability are metrics, traces and logs. The metrics that you are monitoring will vary depending on the component that you sre monitoring. So performance metrics and scalability are key to achieving observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Traces is to do with having an end to end visibility or pinpointing to the line of code that is having issues. Industry is moving from a monolith architecture to a microservice architecture. One problem will have a cascading effect on the entire architecture of your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Logs. Why has logs become a pillar? Is all of us. Whenever we have a problem, we go look at the logs to find out what are the issues in it. AI ops which people are using helps SRE. Chatbots the chatbot integrations. We are moving towards being proactive rather than reactive.
