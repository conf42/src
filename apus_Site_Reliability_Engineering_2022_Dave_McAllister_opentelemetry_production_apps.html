    <meta property="og:description" content="Observability is increasingly important in our modern apps/cloud-native world. However, when adding observability to existing production apps, there are a number of tradeoffs in approaches and in tools. Often, these tradeoffs are an exercise in confusion, leading to decision paralysis. We took on the challenge of adding observability to NGINX MARA, investigating choices, discovering and addressing challenges while keeping to open source solutions whenever possible. You'll come away with an understanding of how the three classes of data (Metrics, Traces, Logs) work together, why we chose the solutions we used and how we extended past the normal space into health checks, introspection and core dumps. Come learn from our experience in dealing with OpenTelemetry and related tools, from traces, metrics and logs, in working with production class apps and discover what approach finally worked for us."/>

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>Observability is increasingly important in our modern apps/cloud-native world. However, when adding observability to existing production apps, there are a number of tradeoffs in approaches and in tools. Often, these tradeoffs are an exercise in confusion, leading to decision paralysis.
We took on the challenge of adding observability to NGINX MARA, investigating choices, discovering and addressing challenges while keeping to open source solutions whenever possible.
You&rsquo;ll come away with an understanding of how the three classes of data (Metrics, Traces, Logs) work together, why we chose the solutions we used and how we extended past the normal space into health checks, introspection and core dumps.
Come learn from our experience in dealing with OpenTelemetry and related tools, from traces, metrics and logs, in working with production class apps and discover what approach finally worked for us.</p>

              Summary

              <li>
                Open telemetry is near and dear to my heart. We're going to talk about how you can add opentelemetry to a modern application. Some of the things you may run into with working in an open telemetry environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A modern application is not defined by its implementation, but by its capabilities. These include portability, scalability, observability, reproducibility, as well as debugability. It also provides context on errors and crashes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mara modern application reference architecture is a microservices architecture. It uses Kubernetes leader in orchestration, of course, and is designed to be production ready. The larger amount is the stuff that the application is dependent on without being hidden below the service.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry is a standards based agents and cloud integration structure offering the capabilities of observability. It has automated code instrumentation, it supports multiple mini frameworks and pretty much any code at any time. Learn more migrate to Opentelemetry today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do we get the data from where it is? To be really useful, those log files need to be easily searchable. Opentelemetry, even though it has logged as one of the classes of data, is in an early beta stage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 distributed tracing is where Opentelemetry started out of open tracing and opensensus. We needed to support all the languages of interest. In our case it was two we had Java and we had Python. We also had two frameworks, sprint boot and spring boot. It is really all about the language.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Anthros has developed a tool that aggregates data from various sources. It uses micrometer, Prometheus, statsd and other tools to do this. The tool was developed in Java and not in python. Anthros hopes the tool can become the underlying structure for distributed tracing.
