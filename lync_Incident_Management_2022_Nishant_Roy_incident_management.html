    <meta property="og:description" content="When working on technical systems, it's inevitable that something will at some point break. Therefore, it is extremely important to be prepared for how to handle such a situation, and ensure you and your team are doing what you can to minimize the downtime for your users and/or customers.  Outages and similar drops in availability can occur in any system, whether it's user facing, employee facing, revenue generating, or recommendation generating.  **By minimizing the time taken to respond to and resolve such an incident, you can make sure to minimize the impact to your topline, customers, and users**  This is a tech talk intended to share some ideas with developers, SREs, and managers, on how to run a healthy incident management process within your organization. When things go wrong, it's extremely important to remain calm, reduce and resolve the impact, retroactively identify the top learnings, and follow up to make your systems more resilient to such outages in the future.  As the engineering manager for the Ads Serving Platform team at Pinterest, which owns multiple business critical services, and a member of the incident manager oncall for Pinterest, I have experienced several high-severity incidents, and have learned a lot from this process. I hope  my learnings can be of use to others in similar positions to run an effective incident response process.  By the end of this talk, the audience should be able to answer the following questions:  1. What differentiates an incident from a bug? 2. How can we empower our team(s) to reduce adverse impact to our customers/users/business? 3. How can we build a healthy culture around learning from our mistakes and growing together? 4. How to measure and track improvements to our incident management process?"/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>When working on technical systems, it&rsquo;s inevitable that something will at some point break. Therefore, it is extremely important to be prepared for how to handle such a situation, and ensure you and your team are doing what you can to minimize the downtime for your users and/or customers.</p>
<p>Outages and similar drops in availability can occur in any system, whether it&rsquo;s user facing, employee facing, revenue generating, or recommendation generating.</p>
<p><strong>By minimizing the time taken to respond to and resolve such an incident, you can make sure to minimize the impact to your topline, customers, and users</strong></p>
<p>This is a tech talk intended to share some ideas with developers, SREs, and managers, on how to run a healthy incident management process within your organization. When things go wrong, it&rsquo;s extremely important to remain calm, reduce and resolve the impact, retroactively identify the top learnings, and follow up to make your systems more resilient to such outages in the future.</p>
<p>As the engineering manager for the Ads Serving Platform team at Pinterest, which owns multiple business critical services, and a member of the incident manager oncall for Pinterest, I have experienced several high-severity incidents, and have learned a lot from this process. I hope  my learnings can be of use to others in similar positions to run an effective incident response process.</p>
<p>By the end of this talk, the audience should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What differentiates an incident from a bug?</li>
<li>How can we empower our team(s) to reduce adverse impact to our customers/users/business?</li>
<li>How can we build a healthy culture around learning from our mistakes and growing together?</li>
<li>How to measure and track improvements to our incident management process?</li>
</ol>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Nashant is the engineering manager for the ad services platform team at Pinterest. Through his involvement with our various incident manager on call rotations, he learned a lot about incident management. Nashant hopes these learnings can be of use to others who are in similar positions and help you run an effective incident response process of your own.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An incident is an event that is not part of the regular operations of a service that are causing an interruption in availability or a reduction in its quality. This is also what differentiates an incident from a bug, which typically will also have an SLA for response.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's typically five main phases. First of all, detection. After that, triage the situation, identify which component is responsible. Finally, remediation. What are the follow up action items that we need to make sure our systems are more resilient to such situations in the future?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We should create incidents when we need immediate support. Who should be declaring the incident? Anybody who notices the impact should be empowered to declare an incident. Make it easy to refer to and understand the incident criteria so they can do so.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The scope of how many people are expected to respond may vary greatly based on the impact. Every team, component, or service within your company's architecture needs some customized criteria for incidents. You'll come up with different thresholds to define what an incident is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When declaring an incident, the first thing to do is open up your communication channels. Next, we need to define and assign some critical roles. The incident runner is responsible for helping drive this incident to a resolution. The other role is the incident manager, responsible for coordinating the incident response.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first priority of the incident response process here is always to stop the bleeding first. The next step is to resolve the root cause, understand what caused the system to get into a state of an incident. Finally, ensure that all your systems are restored to regular operations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Postmortem involves describing the impact, what happened and the root cause. It also provides a detailed timeline of events, including when the incident began. Make sure you're never identifying a person or team as a root cause in a postmortem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's really important to destigmatize incidents within your team and within your organization. We should empower our employees to speak up when they see some impact. Employees who spend these long hours could receive rewards. False positives are significantly better than false negatives.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The guiding principle for an incident manager to follow is to minimize risk and drive resolution. A key part of this is being confident. It's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So to wrap up, we answered four questions here today. We established a clear definition for incidents and how they're different from bug. We discussed ways to measure and improve on our incident handling. And lastly, ways to reward and motivate our teams to take this work seriously.
              </li>
