    <meta property="og:description" content="In the course of your day as an SRE, your knowledge and expertise are in high demand. You can’t do every task every person in your org needs from you without the help of comprehensive automation.   Automation can be tricky. Some systems aren’t built with automation in mind, but assume that a human being will be there to keep an eye on things and fix errors on the fly, and we can’t be everywhere when there’s too much to do.  Plus, you want to provide access to automation for the right folks and keep a record of when the tools were used.   In this talk, we’ll cover some things to keep in mind when you’re building out your automation library, characteristics of good automation, and give you a look at PagerDuty Rundeck, a platform that will help you share your expertise with other folks in your organization.  Build automation that works for you and gives you your time back! "/>

<p>In the course of your day as an SRE, your knowledge and expertise are in high demand. You can’t do every task every person in your org needs from you without the help of comprehensive automation. </p>
<p>Automation can be tricky. Some systems aren’t built with automation in mind, but assume that a human being will be there to keep an eye on things and fix errors on the fly, and we can’t be everywhere when there’s too much to do.</p>
<p>Plus, you want to provide access to automation for the right folks and keep a record of when the tools were used. </p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll cover some things to keep in mind when you’re building out your automation library, characteristics of good automation, and give you a look at PagerDuty Rundeck, a platform that will help you share your expertise with other folks in your organization.</p>
<p>Build automation that works for you and gives you your time back!</p>

              <li>
                Automation is a key component in the management of complex real time systems. To get work done and to do it right, teams rely on automation for their common tasks. Automation can take different forms. After reducing toil, we'll talk about what toil actually is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Toil is the repetitive tactical work that increases linearly as the size of the environment increases. Leaving it neglected will definitely impact user experience sooner or later. Speed curbing mistakes, reducing toil might be some of our goals for things we are targeting for automation manual processes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In your future, you spend most of your time refactoring your automation. Smoothing out the tasks required to get basic tasks done leaves more time for doing all the fun stuff. Instead of running manual processes, you'll be performing more value tasks on a daily basis.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Having fully automated environments can hinder skill development for junior engineers. Maintaining the automation tools for a service is part of maintaining that service itself. Learning how to maintain and test the automation and run folks is a key way to help your new team members learn about the services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a wide variety of tools and platforms available to help you automate workflows across all kinds of options and ecosystems. Here's a list of requirements for good automation. We want our automation to be testable, flexible and repeatable.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Idempotency is the property of certain operations whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. For tasks that you want to automate, you're not going to have a human there. You'll want to add some check to your automation to determine if the change needs to be made in the first place.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to automate the tasks you do most often or the ones that take the most time. How comfortable your team is with any of these things being automation definitely varies. What tasks still exist in your environment that could be automated?

              </li>
