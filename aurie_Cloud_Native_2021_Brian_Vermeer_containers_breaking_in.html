    <meta property="og:description" content="Thereâ€™s no better way to understand container security than seeing some live hacking! This session introduces the state of docker security by reviewing vulnerabilities in Docker images and their impact on applications and demonstrates via hands-on live hacking.   This session further provides the audience with security best practices when building docker container images, and each successful hack will help you better understand the mistakes you can make, their implications, and how you can avoid them."/>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                A container is something that holds a receptible or a good, like your soda can or the airtight container to put your food in. People think in many cases that if you put an application into a container, that by default it is safe from outside vulnerabilities. But this is not true. Here we show you how to build safe containers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Brian Vermeer: Today we are going to talk about securing containers and specifically Docker containers. He says choosing your image correctly, your base image, your foundation of your docker container is crucial. Make sure you only use the stuff that you need because what you do not have in your container cannot harm you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next one, finding, fixing and monitoring open source vulnerabilities in your operating system. Testing is good. When you're building, but also when you're in production, you need to be aware of that. 44% of the Docker images vulnerabilities can be fixed with newer base images.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Rce two is a script that gets again to my localhost and gets a tarball, Netcat. By doing this, if this works, I can execute scripts. The problem is not so much in my application, but in a binary that is served to me together with my docker images.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use a linter or a source code analysis to write better code. There are also security linters that you can use for docker files. Hadolind can for instance, tell you like please use copy instead of add for files and folders. This is an easy tool again to use when breaking docker files yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Your application should also be secure. It's not only your application or only your container, it's both. Most of the problems are in the indirect dependencies, so we should take care of that as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Docker allows you to split builds in different steps. You can divide your build image from your production image. Separating these two is a very good practice and something you should be doing. If a large open source package or container is vulnerable and compromised, there are a lot of victims.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
