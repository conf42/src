              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Apache Airflow can be used to create generative AI pipelines. The code in the demo is open source and available for you to use. Why is airflow so popular to use for AI? It can sit in the middle of your data and ML stack.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Airflow 29 includes new features for creating best practice generative AI pipelines. You need to make sure that your training data is always up to date or you're augmenting data. And then of course, every time you put something into production, you need to worry about scalability and reliability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The task flow API is a pythonic way to write airflow dags. It's a much more natural way that you can create and chain your tasks. You can also mix and match traditional operators and taskflow API. Personally, I've switched over to using decorators whenever possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can configure automatic retries, and this is really a best practice in production. By default, airflow only runs tasks if all the upstream tasks were successful. But if you are using branching, it's very easy to get a situation where one task gets skipped and one is successful. And that's when you need to adjust the trigger rules.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other thing I wanted to mention really quickly in just one slide are deferrable operators. If you are creating generative AI pipelines, it's likely that you have tasks that run for a long time. The best practice here is to use the variable operators whenever possible for longer running tasks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can chain your dags based on the data that they are updating. This is available as of Airflow 24. The data sets are defined in a URI syntax. Now you can see all of your data sets in your DaG graph as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can now schedule on logical dataset expressions. You can also have a DaG running on both time and data set. We now have a rest API endpoint to update datasets. This could be used for cross deployment dependencies. The demo shows all three of these new advanced dataset scheduling features.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other airflow feature that I want to dive in a little bit more deeply is dynamic task mapping. This is really a core airflow feature now that you should be aware of, especially if you're using airflow for generative AI. Use dynamic tasks whenever possible, especially over dynamic Dax.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In the demo there are traditional operators that are dynamically mapped. We had three components for basic dynamic task mapping. The first one was the elements that stay the same in between the dynamically mapped tasks. You can also customize the map index template.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A demo repository that creates LinkedIn posts for me about Apache Airflow. But you can very easily adapt this repository to create any type of content for any topic. It's all open source. You're very free to fork it and to use it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The ingest knowledge base stack is scheduled based on both time. And we can actually see some of the scheduled runs. One way that you can make your airflow easier to use and to reuse certain parts of your code is by modularizing functions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In this demo I have 14 chunks of airflow guides that I'm ingesting into viviate. I modularized all of the code that is used to chunk the text into sizable elements that can be used and ingested. And that gives me this highly adaptable, highly dynamic rag dag.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Python three API scripts and then start fine tuning pipeline. Both validation examples and training examples get evaluated. This is one way that you can use branching to protect yourself from accidentally incurring a lot of cost.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The fine tuning dag uses a deferrable finetune openair operator. Currently this task is deferred because it's waiting for the fine tuning to finish. There are two options to make this operator more efficient.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Custom operators GPT fine tune you can use this operator as a template for your own custom operators. One of the ways that you can standardize how you interact with generative AI. You can run that on any schedule or on specific triggers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Even if you've never run airflow on your computer, you can do this today. Use OpenAI both for your call to create the inference. And also in your vv eight connection in order to create embeddings. Once all of the dags have run you can start creating your own blog posts about airflow.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Both your data and your orchestration with airflow sets you apart from your competitors when creating any genai applications. I hope you fork the repository and have fun with it, create amazing things with it.
              </li>
