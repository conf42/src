    <meta property="og:description" content="When something goes wrong, it can be tempting to gather as many people as you can to fix it. Each person can contribute tremendous value through diverse viewpoints, but too many people can overcrowd your response, leading to miscommunication, redundant work, and much more. This talk will teach you to avoid overcrowding incidents through smarter escalation policies, role-based tasks to organize efforts, and more efficient communication. A lean, focused team of relevant players can achieve much more than a bloated, confused one. Only then will you start to reduce the burden for your on-call team and keep customers happy.

<p>When something goes wrong, it can be tempting to gather as many people as you can to fix it. Each person can contribute tremendous value through diverse viewpoints, but too many people can overcrowd your response, leading to miscommunication, redundant work, and much more. This talk will teach you to avoid overcrowding incidents through smarter escalation policies, role-based tasks to organize efforts, and more efficient communication. A lean, focused team of relevant players can achieve much more than a bloated, confused one. Only then will you start to reduce the burden for your on-call team and keep customers happy.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Nick Mason: You can actually overcrowding your incidents response. Why is it that you call in as many people? Why do incidents get crowded? How to achieve those goals while still preventing overcrowding.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It takes ten to 15 minutes for someone on their team just to get caught up to speed with an incident. Lack of classification when it comes to incident types. Not having a defined escalation policy or a cultural mindset. These are all natural problems that we encounter on a daily basis.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So what is an incident type? Maybe it's use case based. Is it a security incident? Maybe a planned software outage? The severity level has just as much impact as the type of problem. Making sure you have those distinctions is just as important as defining the problem itself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Before you start an incident, stop, think and assess. What type of problem are you encountering? Who is it impacting? And how fast does a escalation actually need to be obtained? Get the right people to join who are going to be efficient.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A combination of those three roles is very powerful to make sure that there are particular lanes of focus. And I think this really alleviates one of the big fears that we talked about earlier, is that people start to get paranoid. If you have these roles and these checklists already defined, people will be confident.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Roles and tasks help with accountability and communication. As the incident evolves, communicate, period. We recommend trying to get a system in place to automatically deliver updates to relevant stakeholders.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Communication should be something that alleviates these sorts of concerns. Having automatic systems set up to deliver messages when status changes is really great. With good tooling and with somebody focused on this sort of communication aspect, you can really alleviate a lot of the burden.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Communication doesn't need to be limited to that particular role. Mark something as important and let those key contribute with incident roles, handle their tasks. Having these elements incorporated into your incident management process will help you cut through the noise and drive towards resolution at a much quicker pace.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You really do need a cultural foundation that's built around that trust. The idea of kind of psychological safety that you're not going to get punished for screwing up the process. The retrospective or the post incident analysis is a great way for your employees to feel heard.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Emily, is there anything else you'd like to add? We hope that we've convinced you that sometimes a lean, focused team can beat out a large all hands on deck scenario. Have a great day.
