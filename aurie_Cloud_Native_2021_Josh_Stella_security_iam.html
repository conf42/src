    <meta property="og:title" content="Locking Down the Security of IAM | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS), you’re probably making extensive use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s a powerful service for managing access to your AWS services and resources that is almost like a new kind of network in the cloud.   But for enterprise cloud environments, AWS IAM security can become quite complex. Recent high-profile cloud-based data breaches have involved AWS IAM but cannot be chalked up to simple customer mistakes. Rather, advanced cloud misconfiguration attacks exploit IAM misconfigurations that compliance controls and security professionals often miss.   In this session, Josh will walk through some of these  IAM misconfigurations, using the AWS console to demonstrate  to  participants how to avoid becoming a victim of cloud exploits through IAM.  Josh will dig into AWS IAM and take us on a deep dive into the layers of AWS IAM and how malicious actors can exploit common misconfigurations to gain access to—and extract—data without detection.   You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you’ve missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.  In this talk, Fugue co-founder and CEO,  Josh Stella digs into how AWS IAM works to help you think more critically about the security for your AWS use cases. You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you may have missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.    "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS), you’re probably making extensive use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s a powerful service for managing access to your AWS services and resources that is almost like a new kind of network in the cloud. </p>
<p>But for enterprise cloud environments, AWS IAM security can become quite complex. Recent high-profile cloud-based data breaches have involved AWS IAM but cannot be chalked up to simple customer mistakes. Rather, advanced cloud misconfiguration attacks exploit IAM misconfigurations that compliance controls and security professionals often miss. </p>
<p>In this session, Josh will walk through some of these  IAM misconfigurations, using the AWS console to demonstrate  to  participants how to avoid becoming a victim of cloud exploits through IAM.  Josh will dig into AWS IAM and take us on a deep dive into the layers of AWS IAM and how malicious actors can exploit common misconfigurations to gain access to—and extract—data without detection. </p>
<p>You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you’ve missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.</p>
<p>In this talk, Fugue co-founder and CEO,  Josh Stella digs into how AWS IAM works to help you think more critically about the security for your AWS use cases. You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you may have missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Josh Stella is the CEO CTO of Fug. Fug is a company that secures cloud infrastructure structure toand checks it for compliance. Today we're going to be talking about locking down the security of IAM in the AWS cloud. Most of this will be hands on at the whiteboard.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hackers are using automation to just look at every single object they can reach via the Internet. The main attack surface in the cloud is not the operating system of servers. A lot of the techniques that the hackers are using are not caught by compliance standards.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We'll start with understanding how IAM works, and then we're going to go to the whiteboard and iam going to show you a simplified form of this. I believe it is absolutely essential for you to have a functional mental model to really understand what's going on in IAM.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first term we're going to focus on is principal. In AWS, a principal is an actor. They do actions by sending requests. It's just authentication and authorization, in that order. Let's switch to the whiteboard.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of the complexities in designing secure IAm are not constrained to just the policy understanding. For any given function that you want to perform in the AWS cloud, there are a list of actions that that principle needs access to. It's best to think of actions as just a big long list.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AWS policies are where you're going to be effectively defining the allowances and the denials. This is one of the places where people really get burned with Iam, and it's really easy to do. You really do need, if you want secure iam to fully understand which actors are truly necessary for the business function.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Baz: A lot of what goes on in AWS hacking is people being overly permissive. When new actions come out on the services, iam going to inherit those because of the star. That's really how we get into trouble with IAM, is through over permissiveness.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                IAM isn't the only place we can put allowances and denials. In fact, it interacts with things like s three bucket policies. There are a million ways to do security well in AWS. There is no one right way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AWS, we're were talking and you've got my contact info now so thanks for attending, and good luck on your secure AWS. You've got the mental model, you got the piece parts. You can do it.
