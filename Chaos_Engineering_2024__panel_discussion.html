              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                This is a Chaos Engineering panel at Con 42. Prithviraj is a CNCF ambassador and technical community manager at Harness. With him are four amazing folks from the Chaos engineering community.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Anurag, Sylvan, Miko and Karthik will talk about chaos engineering. The panel looks stacked. We have a lot of chaos engineering insights for folks tuning in.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Miko: How did you get involved in the Chaos engineering community? He says he joined the community like four or five years ago, and has been seeing the exponential growth. He says chaos engineering has grown exponentially in the last two, three, four years.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Karthik: You were one of the founding members of the Litmus Chaos community. Tell us more about how litmus chaos came into play. The motivations to carry out chaos engineering is similar to what Miko just explained.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sylvan has been sharing a lot of experiences on culture practices using chaos. The chaos toolkit format is designed to delegate to better tools for the fault itself. It was a great outcome after years of working with Netflix, doing this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mandi: The only thing that I do is I always treat people nicely. It's my only culture. As a community, as a global community, we should be more aligned and more talking to each other. Sylvan Walls said talking about it more would have helped the community.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sylvan: As a community, we've not been good at joining forces into a bigger thing. There is still a lot of advocacy with the audience that we have in mind. But as open source communities, we don't have the bandwidth to be there for every single person.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open source projects are not just open source projects. The idea of chaos suffers is people start using it. But then there's some hard call that's taken that there's no budget for this, or this is not our priority right now. With how things are moving, chaos engineering is being cornered.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Karthik: What are the challenges that you have seen moving from open source to enterprise, or just the enterprise adoption side of things in today's world? How does chaos scale? There are a lot of operational constraints.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Reliability is understood differently by different people. How do you quantify the impact of chaos? Many organizations who are beginning out with chaos expect some kind of solutioning. A lot of these conversations gives us a lot of insights.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Miko: How do you see modern chaos engineering today? I mean, there's generative AI as well, which is being induced right now to move chaos forward. What's your thought process on how chaos has changed from back then to today?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With AI, we're at a very interesting time in the evolution, I think, of humans in general. For us, like in the SRE space and incident management and chaos engineering, that creates a massive opportunity. I think with things changing, and as you mentioned over the last couple of years, we'll see a lot of change.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sylvan: I want to spend a lot of time trying to care for Chaos Toolkit. I would like to be a bit more developer centric. I sense that there is a fatigue of new things coming all the time. So I'm interested in going back to perhaps talking to developers or engineers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sylvan: How do you see the future of chaos engineering overall? He says as long as chaos engineering streamlines itself into the delivery pipeline, I think it's going to win. But if it sticks to be that thing that lives in its ivory tower somewhere, it will struggle.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Anurag: Chaos engineering is going to treat faults as just going to commoditize faults. It's going to be about what insights it is giving about the system. How do you measure and what all can you measure? Karthik: Would you like to share some insights on the future direction of chaos engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Miko: I would love to see us come together a bit more often. If we manage to figure out the human aspect a bit better, we'll be on the right track. And again, I hope to see more conversations happening around chaos and similar pan is going through.
