            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                I would argue that DevOps was never born, Mandi, because of that, it's not dead. New roles pops up to resolve a lot of pressure put on the shoulders of engineers. I think platform engineering is a great thing, but I wonder if people fully understand what is behind platform engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With the emerging of cloud, Mandi, cloud native technology, I think now it's much more easier to get started and implement that. Part of it too is the evolution from waterfall to agile. But if you're still in the old fashioned technology, it's more difficult to implement those automated processes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mandi: I was wondering if the rest of you could give a bit of background of where you're coming from. I used to be a software developer. I moved to performance engineering, where I spent most of my career. Recently I moved from performance engineering to observability. And I'm more touching, more cloud native topics now today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you do performance engineering, you are driving the approach from the beginning, from the dev stage to production. The performance is not limited to response times anymore, it's larger. This is where observability come into picture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I started out as a Linux systems administrator back when people thought that was foolish. Now I do community Devrel kind of things. Currently work at Pagerduty. So we're working with incident response and helping people. We do still run into companies that are doing agile fall.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mandi's journey as head of reliability engineering ended two years ago when he became a founder. He left his job to set up a company called Uptime Labs, which focuses on incident response. One reason he did it was because he was really missing coding.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 platform engineering is a new role that aims to make the DevOps culture even more stronger in the organizations. It looks like an internal product to help your application developers utilize all of the products that you use to build your software. I'm eager to see if most of the organization implementing platform engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                From a security perspective, I think that platform engineering is super exciting. If you can catch something as it's happening, you can save a lot of money if you can find it very quickly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hamed: What is the boundaries of platform engineer? He says the customers are the team and not the users of the applications. Is there a way to link or measure which project are more important to the other based on revenue? Hamed: IT industry is young compared to established industries like aviation or civil engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Everything is based on software today. And I think probably we need to wake up and accept that our industry is now a safety critical industry. System failure can have impacts far worse than plane falling off the sky. I think that's the next big thing for our industry towake up and take steps toward that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Software in the cloud is 3% of the carbon footprint. More than 16% of carbon footprint usage globally will be data centers. Why are we not respecting all those processes? Technology is moving so fast in it world.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                On the security side, and privacy specifically, we talk about data minimization. If more of us design our systems where we respect our users privacy, we only collect data that we're actually going to use. What do you predict for the future of AI?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I think we are not mature enough to make these automated decisions without measuring the actual impact on the complex environment. No large enterprises are in a place that they're going to do that yet. There's a lot of maturation that would need to happen in the models to trust your data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                More than 70% of the codes in the IT industry are written by male people. We have smaller participation from women in coding. With women it's a lot cultural rather than our actual anatomy that's making us act differently. I'd love to see what AI makes of code from different countries.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mandi: Your projects are getting more complex, so you cannot be an expert on everything. Things that you're doing are ultimately in service of your eventual customer. My favorite part of DevOps is how much it increases security. We're moving more and more towards making sure our services are always available.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Great. Okay, well, thank you everyone for coming today. It was so awesome meeting all of you. It's really good conversation. Yeah, thanks.
