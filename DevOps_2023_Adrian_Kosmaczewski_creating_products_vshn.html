    <meta property="og:description" content="Since 2014, our slogan at VSHN has been _The DevOps Company_. Following that ethos, VSHN applies all of its DevOps, Agile, and Sociocracy practice to creating our services and products. How to take into account diverging opinions during product development? How to match ethical business practices with market needs? How can a company be respectful of its employees and profitable simultaneously? Is there a working alternative to hierarchies? In this session, you will discover how DevOps shaped all our decisions, from idea to market. In particular, we will describe the challenges, processes, and decisions we took while creating our latest product, "APPUiO Cloud.""/>

<p>Since 2014, our slogan at VSHN has been <em>The DevOps Company</em>. Following that ethos, VSHN applies all of its DevOps, Agile, and Sociocracy practice to creating our services and products. How to take into account diverging opinions during product development? How to match ethical business practices with market needs? How can a company be respectful of its employees and profitable simultaneously? Is there a working alternative to hierarchies? In this session, you will discover how DevOps shaped all our decisions, from idea to market. In particular, we will describe the challenges, processes, and decisions we took while creating our latest product, &ldquo;APPUiO Cloud.&rdquo;</p>

                Services Mocheski: I'm developer relations at Vision, the DevOps company. Today I'm going to talk about how we build Appuio cloud at vision. How we use DevOps to create it. And then I will give some technical details.

              <li>
                Vision is a company of 50 people located in Zurich. It offers DevOps as a service with a full team of Kubernetes and Openshift experts. All decisions happen through consensus among all visioneers. The company has been self funded since day one in 2014 and profitable since 2017.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Appuio Cloud is meant to be an entry level product catering to Openshift customers. It is a public platform, so it comes with some gotcha. The resource availability is not guaranteed. There are community support packages available at extra cost.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Appuio Cloud's architecture follows Conway's law. The company has created three different sets of documentation. transparency is one of our values at vision. All the features of Appuio cloud are possible to be released either now or later.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Abu cloud is not and will never be finished right? It is a product that changes continuously, sometimes in small ways and sometimes in bigger ones. We realized that in our preparation we have not designed our cpu request pricing properly. We rectified our policies openly and communicated clearly with our customers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Team that built Appuio Cloud is called Aldebaran. Trust is the key ingredient for an asynchronous work culture. Can other organizations use a similar process to create a product? Yes, but with a few caveats.
