    <meta property="og:title" content="Hundreds of Microservices without breaking your APIs | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="Managing dozens or hundreds of microservices in scale can be very challenging. As developers, we often find ourselves blind to how our application is actually behaving in production, what dependencies we should be aware of and what should we check before deploying a new version.  In this talk, we will introduce a new method to collect and analyze microservices communication from production and how to leverage this data during development and testing phases to improve our code.  By relying on production behavior we can automatically generate tests that are more efficient, catch dependencies that are about to break in real-life and to have our developers more product & product oriented."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Managing dozens or hundreds of microservices in scale can be very challenging. As developers, we often find ourselves blind to how our application is actually behaving in production, what dependencies we should be aware of and what should we check before deploying a new version.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will introduce a new method to collect and analyze microservices communication from production and how to leverage this data during development and testing phases to improve our code.</p>
<p>By relying on production behavior we can automatically generate tests that are more efficient, catch dependencies that are about to break in real-life and to have our developers more product &amp; product oriented.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Michael Haberman is the co founder and CTO of Aspecto. He will talk about microservices in particular a lot of microservices, and even more particular, not breaking your API. Specifically, he'll talk about distributed tracing and how we can use it to overcome microservice issues.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I've been doing microservices for about five years. Started as an independent consultant. In the last two years I decided that I'm going to do my own thing. Started Aspecto basically product focus on helping developers with microservices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most companies are migrating to microservices rather than starting a brand new company or product with microservices. Understanding the bigger picture, understanding who is consuming who and how they're consuming are the main concerns. As your architectural picture grows, the risk of having production issues increases.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                People are having a hard time to understand their architecture, they are doing an architectural document. And I bet that each and one of you has in your organization some kind of an architectural chart. But it's never up to date, it's always a leg behind.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open API really helps you to kind of document your HTTP endpoints. And the question how services communicate between one another. Maybe another documentation, maybe to find some service map solution. You could try to find a way, but also it's a challenge.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If your service is down, you may lose data. We need to move from synchronous to unsynchronous communication. There are endless options out there to choose the right one for you. You just need to use it in the way that fits your need.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Yeager: The more micro you go, the more complexity you are going to face. There is something out there called distributed breaking, getting more and more popular. Open telemetry allows you to do distributed tracing. Being able to see it all together kind of give you the story of what happened to a particular API call.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Yeager shows diagram of dependencies between services. It doesn't answer important question of when in which endpoint they are going to start to communicate with one another. This is kind of the resolution that the developer is looking for.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Let's assume that you started to collect distributed tracing data. You need to start to introduce some tools that allows you to do that if you want to generate mocks. CTo: Get familiar with open telemetry, get to know distributed tracing, understand how to implement it.
