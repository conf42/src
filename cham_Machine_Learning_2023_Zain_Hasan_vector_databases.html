<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve gotten used to natural language search and recommendation systems. We expect to get what we search for without remembering the exact keywords.To solve these problems at scale we need a database that understands our data, this is where vector databases take center stage and really shine!</p>

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 vector databases allow you to do a similarity search or a semantic search over your data. Instead of just being able to search over a couple of documents or thousands of documents, it can search over hundreds of millions or billions of documents. There are two hurdles in the way of achieving semantic search.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A vector database can store both unstructured data objects and their corresponding vector embeddings. To make this scalable and efficient, you have to implement a nearest neighbor's algorithm. Here, we show you an example of what querying a vector database looks like.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Instead of just letting it rely on its general knowledge of information, you also pass it relevant documents or relevant information. If we want to scale these approach, we can replace that user that was sitting there and filtering our documents with a vector database.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A short demo shows you the power of vector databases and what they enable. To get this demo working you're going to need the Python Weaviate client. You also need to create a remote cluster that is going to store your data and then perform vector search over it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The power of vector databases is that they can search over your data. Instead of searching for a value string or a keyword search, we want to search for a concept. With semantic search, you can really remedy this problem really quickly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is the idea of generative search, searching over your vector database and then piping those to a large language model. providing those results as context to the large language models so that it can answer a query or a prompt using those documents as context.
              </li>
