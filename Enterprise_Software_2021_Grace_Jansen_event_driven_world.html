                In this coffee example, we have coffee lovers coming in and making coffee orders via HTTP request to a coffee shop. What people often suggest when they're looking at applications like this is to introduce something called events driven architecture. A tool that's often used is Apache Kafka.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Reactive systems aims to ensure that every stage of our application is asynchronous and nonblocking, and highly responsive and reactive. This is all about decoupling the different components of your applications so that a potential failure in one wouldn't cause a failure across the application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So reactive architecture design patterns, there are many of them. We also need to ensure that the logic we're writing within our microservices is also highly responsive, nonblocking and reactive. How do we enable greater resiliency within our application?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it comes to creating resilient producers, we have to consider our delivery guarantees and our configuration. With resilient consumers, the configuration value we need to be aware of is how we're committing our offsets. How often do you retry sending that record or message?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kafka is designed to work well at scale and to be scalable itself. For producing applications it does this using partitions. Each consumer will be assigned a partition. This really allows sort of scalability of consumers by grouping them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do we actually go about writing reactive Kafka applications? What tools and technologies can we utilize? Take a look at some of the open source reactive frameworks and toolkits that are available.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 eclipse microprofile is an open source, community driven specification for enterprise Java microservices. It interoperates with the reactive stream specification that we mentioned earlier. And actually we utilize Kafka in one of our demo applications when we were converting it from a standard Java Kafka application to a reacting one.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So we've got a system microservice and an inventory microservice, and they're communicating via Kafka in the middle there. We're going to be utilizing these touch commands to make it a bit easier to create our file system. After we complete all of this lab, this module, you can check out the finished application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need to create the microprofile config properties for each microservice. We're using the incoming annotation because we're consuming from Kafka, but we're still consuming from the same system load. Make sure you save because otherwise your application won't be able to build.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Right now these version of Kafka we're using needs zookeeper for metadata information. So hopefully that should show you that actually it can be fairly easy utilizing a reactive framework or toolkit to create really reactive responsive Java kafka based applications.
              </li>
