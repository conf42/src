                I'm a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon, currently working for Salesforce. I am also a battle scar veteran of agile gone wrong. You can see the pitfalls of not designing things according to how they're actually going to need to be used over the longer term.

              <li>
                Agile is a set of principles which can help guide your software development. It prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation. We learn things by iterating and that goes into our last point where we are responding to change instead of rigidly following a plan.

                Failure 101: How do you know if your product is successful? Understand what is going to make people use your product. Also understand what would cause you to stop developing this product. Once you understand what success looks like, the next likely issue is you didn't plan for success.

              <li>
                There is no such thing as a safe change. Everything in your service must accommodate failure. It's not enough to plan for failure, but you also need to know how to recover from a complete outage.

              <li>
                Don't design for greater reliability than needed. The cheapest place to make changes is when you're designing and you haven't yet written a line of code. Most dangerous thing for an online service is being embarrassingly successful.

              <li>
                One of the big things with agile is agile has a tendency to concentrate on short term deliverables. In terms of tactics, you want to delay non critical decisions as long as possible. You really want to get the critical architecture right the first time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Two way doors are decisions which can be easily reverted. One way doors put you on a set path with no easy way to backtrack. Sometimes you need to take a step back to go take three steps forward. What's important is that you get to the right end point.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Even in agile, planning is necessary. But this isn't the same as waterfall. Code is not your only deliverable online services really are more than just code. Integrate non code deliverables into your planning and execution cycles.
