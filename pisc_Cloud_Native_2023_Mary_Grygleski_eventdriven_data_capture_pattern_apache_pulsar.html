              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                My topic is about event driven change data capture pattern using Apache Pulsar. This particular pattern is ideal if you are running things in a cloud, a cloud native kind of environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mary Grygleski is a streaming developer advocate at Datastax. The company's flagship product is based on Apache Cassandra. Also recently acquired another company called Cascada, which is a real time AI software. We're going to talk about change data capture CDC now.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                CDC is to serve data sources such as databases or data lakes, or even like data warehouses too. The idea is to detect changes and then essentially to capture the changes too. These changes be propagated to downstream data systems too. Today's talk is really about a new way of doing things in real time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What make up a CDC system? The change detection piece of it. And then from there basically the changes will get propagated. In fact it's more desirable would be using a log based type of approach for CDC.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What are the requirements for a modern CDC system? Definition of modern. It can be either on prem type of or private cloud, right? Or public cloud or hybrid cloud. The system itself needs to be very scalable, very elastic, so to speak. And then also too, the system must be very responsive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Apache Pulsar makes use of the pub sub approach of message delivery. It is designed with the cloud native in mind and basically very good design. It separates out the compute and storage. The client binding the APIs can be in different languages.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Apache Pulsar is increasing in popularity. In 2021 it was one of the top five Apache projects too in the foundation. Big companies such as Yahoo, Overstock, Splunk, Verizon, all these GM are already using it. New UI that we're coming out to that helps you in writing your producer and consumer code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to get back to CDC enabling CDC for AstraDB. So in other words, you can actually go do detecting changes in an Astra database, Cassandra database. And then you write all the transform data back down to the downstream targets. So really, really flexible data stacks too.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The link to our documentation describes how you can do CDC for estradb. It will guide you through how to set up CDC change data capture. From that point on you can then connect your streaming tenant to an elastic.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We offer like $25 credit to per month you can use for free. These are resources for our Apache Pulsar and Astra from Datastax. Here is additional credit if you're a small business. You need more credits.
