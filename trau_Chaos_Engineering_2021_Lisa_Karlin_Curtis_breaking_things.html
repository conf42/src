    <meta property="og:description" content="Unless you know all the assumptions the consumers of your API have made, it’s impossible to reliably avoid breaking their software. Assuming you, like me, can’t read minds, what can we do to try and keep the number of sad developers to a minimum?  Breaking changes are sad. We’ve all been there; someone else changes their API in a way you weren’t expecting, and now you have a live-ops incident you need to fix urgently to get your software working again. Of course, many of us are on the other side too: we build APIs that other people’s software relies on. There are many strategies to mitigate breaking changes: think SemVer or API versioning, but all rely on the API developer identifying which changes are breaking.  That’s the bit we’ll focus on in this talk: how do you (a) Get really good at identifying what changes *might* break someone’s integration (b) Help your API consumers to build integrations that are resilient to these kinds of changes (c) Release potentially breaking changes as safely as possible"/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Unless you know all the assumptions the consumers of your API have made, it’s impossible to reliably avoid breaking their software. Assuming you, like me, can’t read minds, what can we do to try and keep the number of sad developers to a minimum?</p>
<p>Breaking changes are sad. We’ve all been there; someone else changes their API in a way you weren’t expecting, and now you have a live-ops incident you need to fix urgently to get your software working again. Of course, many of us are on the other side too: we build APIs that other people’s software relies on.
There are many strategies to mitigate breaking changes: think SemVer or API versioning, but all rely on the API developer identifying which changes are breaking.</p>
<p>That’s the bit we’ll focus on in this talk: how do you
(a) Get really good at identifying what changes <em>might</em> break someone’s integration
(b) Help your API consumers to build integrations that are resilient to these kinds of changes
&copy; Release potentially breaking changes as safely as possible</p>

              <li>
                Lisa Karlin Curtis is a software engineer at Gocardless. She talks about how we can help stop breaking other people's things. She explains how easy it is to accidentally break someone else's thing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A breaking change is something where I, as the API developer, do a thing and someone's integration breaks. This happens because an assumption that's been made by that integrator is no longer correct. It may indeed be their fault, but it's often your problem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As an integrator you want the engineers who run the services you use to be constantly improving it. But in a way you also want them to not touch it at all so that you can be sure its behavior won't change. If we want to stop breaking other people's things, we need to help our integrators stop making bad assumptions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A change isn't just either breaking or not, almost anything can be breaking. Try to empathize with your integrators about what assumptions these might have made. You want to be able to scale your release approach depending on how many integrators have made the bad assumption.
