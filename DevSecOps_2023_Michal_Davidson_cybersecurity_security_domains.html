<p>Whether youâ€™re developing your Cybersecurity career, or searching for talent- Security is too general a term.
It&rsquo;s time to start using Security Domains to map out career paths in Security.

              <li>
                Michael Davidson is a software architect at Dell. He's passionate about increasing diversity in the field of cybersecurity. He says we need to break security up into different domains in order to create communities and networks.

              <li>
                Network security has evolved in the last few years because of cloud security and because of zero trust. The single sign on multifactor authentication, identity and access management is critical in cloud security. Other aspects like cryptography too.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 monitoring is seeing a ton of growth in the last few years, I would say, because of cloud security. Most experts in developing and designing monitoring tools are not going to be necessarily with a security background, rather with an AI background. This is a whole cool new developing domain with a lot of potential.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cryptography is what initially kind of drew me into security. If you have a math background, it's a great way to work in the field of security. Within cryptography, there are niche fields like embedded security. There are a lot of courses available online for free.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I'm going to provide now some resources. Like I mentioned, cryptography. There's a great introduction to cryptography course on Coursera available for free. Cyber is a great resource if you are interested in ethical white hat hacking and penetration testing. I just love if you follow my blog on Medium is Architect.
