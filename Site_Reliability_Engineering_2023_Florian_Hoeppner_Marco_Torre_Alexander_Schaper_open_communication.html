              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                We will cover today psychology safety in the context of SIE. We have some case studies ready for you. We plan to talk around 25 minutes, something like this. And we will also show a little bit of tool we used in our case study.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Flaunt Hubner is tech strategy from Accenture and working out of New York. Alexander Schopper is a principal director with our talent and communication practice. Marco Torre is a senior manager at Accenture. So happy to talk to you about this topic.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of companies are still working one side in waterfall model and one side with agile teams. This is leading to more and more complexity on the other side. In all of these areas, the people are key. Communication is really the most important thing because of changing technologies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Site reliability engineering challenges relate to a topic that we've been focused on a lot around psychological safety. Think about the soft skills that a site reliability engineer needs. This might mean engaging with the business, engaging with architectures, and bringing up some uncomfortable conversations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So I'm in no shape or form an expert in the theory behind psychological safety. What are the differences that we see across four dimensions. Mistakes that can be made, feedback that we're sharing back with our teams, and then, of course, the elephant in the room. Management, our leadership.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Do you feel like you're in a team when there's constant finger pointing going on? How are we making our team members feel when they actually do make a mistake? Do we feel that we have a culturally safe environment to take risk?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we break down the silos in an organization that when I'm end to end responsible for something, there's not so much blame anymore. This also leads into a better culture. How we structure teams is also leading a little bit in the direction of how we treat people.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Focus on psychology, safety, focusing on improving trust is a key topic for your team. It can improve your innovation, your productivity and your skill application. Culture is intangible, it's very hard to change culture. Investing in communication is definitely going to pay off.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                During the pandemic, we saw incredible productivity and efficiency gains. How did this team overcome a culture of blame? How was it able to learn from mistakes? And ultimately, is this a model that you can scale across the organization?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Team ran three or four retrospectives or postmortems over the course of three months. Used online collaboration tools like Miro and Mirror to facilitate anonymous conversations. Looked at what does it take for behaviors and new ways of working for to stick with the team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The flow zone is characterized by teams that want to learn from their mistakes. Teams that have both high psychological safety and high motivational drivers, they actually proactively assume accountability. That's the type of quality and culture that we need if we want to enable a SRE organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A survey tool called the Insight scan generates real time data on team level psychological safety and motivation. What we want to do is for the team, during the retrospective or the blameless, to measure this in real time. And what that led to was a change in the ways of working.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The best practice is to leave with specific improvement ideas, not just as a team. The key piece is small sres micro learning. Starting small and giving everybody the chance to weigh in is a critical piece here. There are real tangible team benefits, real benefits to team performance through this approach.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Site reliability engineering is so niche that it's hard to fill. Being able to be more open will allow us to maybe find some of these systemic issues that are around. And I'm sure there's also some organizational impacts that probably Florian would love to touch on.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One key topic I want to touch on is really this, we talked now about the team level, but also this is enabling full enterprise transformation. A lot of teams don't keep psychology safe enough to go into a risk situation. We are always happy to talk about this topic or also other topics in SIE, DevOps and so on.
              </li>
