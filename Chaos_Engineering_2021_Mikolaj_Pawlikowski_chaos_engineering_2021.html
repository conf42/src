    <meta property="og:description" content="Chaos Engineering has come a long way in the recent years.  Starting with Chaos Monkey, through the distributed effort, it has evolved into a serious, scientific method of making your software better.  In this talk, Mikolaj Pawlikowski, the author of "Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption" will talk about the journey so far, and what lies ahead.  Oh, and we'll see whether sharks are really more dangerous than hamburgers."/>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 chaos engineering is all about testing the resiliency and the reliability. Things that we were taking for granted couldn't be taken for granted anymore. Engineering is at an interesting crossroads right now. There are different trends and phenomena in software engineering that put chaos engineering in a nice spot for adoption.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Scale, cloud, native and complexity. Trend that makes chaos engineering so important right now is the cloud. Networking is pretty hard. Latencies, how do latencies affect your systems? Do you survive them? What about timeouts?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in a system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions. It doesn't replace the different ways of testing. It's all about thinking, what if.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every new technology goes through something like this, whether it's smartphones or tablets or wearables. As it goes and gets more and more adoption, it turns into boring and just part of the landscape. This year might be just a moment when it becomes a fact of life.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The myths that still kind of float around chaos engineering are one of the top contributors to why generating buy in for chaos engineering is still a little bit tricky in 2021. One myth is that it's only for massively distributed systems. The fact that we have this entire spectrum means that adoption is possible for different companies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The selling point of curse engineering is that you can do it during working hours. But the more complicated conversation typically is with your manager. How likely are you to die of a shark attack? How scared should you be? Using chaos engineering can be fun and easy.
              </li>
