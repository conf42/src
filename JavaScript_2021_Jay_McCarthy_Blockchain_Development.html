    <meta property="og:title" content="Breaking Into Blockchain Development with JavaScript | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="Blockchain development is unreasonably complex, expensive, divided and exclusive. We are introducing a way for JavaScript developers to build decentralized apps on any blockchain using familiar syntax. It's faster, cheaper and more secure than how it's done today with Solidity and TEA. It's compatible with frontend languages like React, Vue & Go. Long are the days where you have to get investment, hire a PhD mathematician, hire rare blockchain developers, learn Solidity, request an audit and deploy a unique build for each environment. Best part? No need to learn a new language.   We've built the Reach library with JavaScript syntax so it's a linear move. You can build DApps as a 1-(wo)man show. We've had developers rebuild the Balancer Exchange (thousands of line of code) with 100 lines of our code."/>

<p>Blockchain development is unreasonably complex, expensive, divided and exclusive. We are introducing a way for JavaScript developers to build decentralized apps on any blockchain using familiar syntax. It&rsquo;s faster, cheaper and more secure than how it&rsquo;s done today with Solidity and TEA. It&rsquo;s compatible with frontend languages like React, Vue &amp; Go. Long are the days where you have to get investment, hire a PhD mathematician, hire rare blockchain developers, learn Solidity, request an audit and deploy a unique build for each environment. Best part? No need to learn a new language. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built the Reach library with JavaScript syntax so it&rsquo;s a linear move. You can build DApps as a 1-(wo)man show. We&rsquo;ve had developers rebuild the Balancer Exchange (thousands of line of code) with 100 lines of our code.</p>

                How to break into blockchain development using the Reach programming language. Reach leverages JavaScript as the primary way of programming. This talk will primarily be about what the idea of blockchain is. Not like a tutor tutorial about how to program it.

              <li>
                When I talk about breaking into blockchain development, I'm not really talking about cryptocurrencies. There's simply a new category of programming that is based on decentralized applications and blockchains. It allows payment processors to impose constraints on front ends and back ends.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The standard way of developing blockchain programs is very low level. One of the most popular languages for blockchain programming right now is called solidity. We at reach have designed a programming language and platform that makes programming in this world easier.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Reach takes the Javascript model of concurrency and applies it to blockchain. It abstracts all of the low level complexities that blockchain imposes with regards to concurrency. The main tool that we use in reach to provide this is a compilation technique called Endpoint projection.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Blockchain programming is inherently dangerous. It exposes the entire database to control by arbitrary people on the outside world. The risk of writing the wrong program is higher because you can't update the program later. There are a wide variety of attacks and losses that have code about because programs fail to do this correctly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Blockchains tend to be very quote, tribal. Reach is blockchain agnostic, which means that we allow you to go above the tribalism that tends to exist in the blockchain world. Reach provides automatic formal verification that makes it so that you won't make mistakes.
