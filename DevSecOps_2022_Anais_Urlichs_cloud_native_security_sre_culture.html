              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Anis Oles: How can we integrate cloud native security tools best practices into our site reliability engineering? Oles is the open source developer advocate at acro security. In this talk he wants to speak about the overlap between site reliability Engineering and cloudnative security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The SRE culture focuses on continuous improvement and embracing risk. The other thing is analyze learnings, analyze your failures and learn from them. And the last thing is autonomy. It was my first SRE role where I had experience in the cloud native space.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is devsecops? It's about integrating security into all of our business functions by empowering people and creating accountability. We want to incorporate security into every business functions, whether that's administration or engineering. It's not about finger pointing, it's about having more productive outcomes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE practice and security practices have a really tight overlap. When we define healthy services, we should also define secure services. The next thing is visibility. Automation is great for different aspects. But we have to be careful about when we do automation for SOE work and cloud native security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The needs for the different tools and the way that you need to integrate security tooling and practices will be different. Different tools are installed differently. The number of integrations and the type of Integrations available can also be important. Finally, a global view of the security state of services is very important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Trivia is an all in one security scanner. It does vulnerability scans of any container image it finds inside of your cluster. It also does exposed secret scans. If everything is a Kubernetes resource, you can then use the same processes across your stack.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The same doesn't hold true for security, right? You don't need to define how you scan your resources. Set up alerts and make your vulnerabilities scream at you. optimize based on what works for your team. Every application will be differently deployed depending on your environment.
              </li>
