    <meta property="og:title" content="Addressing Cloud Security with Open Policy Agent (OPA) | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="OPA is an open source policy as code framework and toolset which can be used to validate policy compliance of cloud infrastructure environments. Learn how OPA works, how cloud engineering and dev teams can leverage it and other open source tools to prevent deployment of resource misconfigurations.  The challenges of building and modifying at-scale cloud infrastructure environments led to the development of infrastructure as code, and now the challenges of managing the security and compliance of those environments has led to policy as code. Cloud environments are simply too vast, complex and dynamic to address with traditional security and compliance approaches such as manual audits and checklists. Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source policy as code framework and toolset thatâ€™s a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)."/>

<p>OPA is an open source policy as code framework and toolset which can be used to validate policy compliance of cloud infrastructure environments. Learn how OPA works, how cloud engineering and dev teams can leverage it and other open source tools to prevent deployment of resource misconfigurations.</p>
<p>The challenges of building and modifying at-scale cloud infrastructure environments led to the development of infrastructure as code, and now the challenges of managing the security and compliance of those environments has led to policy as code. Cloud environments are simply too vast, complex and dynamic to address with traditional security and compliance approaches such as manual audits and checklists. Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source policy as code framework and toolset thatâ€™s a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Josh Stella is the co founder and chief technology officer at Fug. He will talk about open policy agent addressing cloud security with OPA. The big attack vector on cloud is misconfiguration of cloud resources. We'll talk a little bit about getting started with policy code using O PA.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nearly all successful attacks on cloud services are the result of customer misconfiguration, mismanagement and mistakes, according to Neil McDonald from Gartner. 93% were concerned about a major security breach due to mis configuration. Getting it correct is extraordinarily difficult and complex. If you get it wrong, it can have devastating consequences.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud misconfiguration is pretty much universally overlooked in some way or another. Many dangerous cloud misconfigurations are not recognized by the security team. Because of the changing nature of cloud, the constant mutation of infrastructure in cloud, this is like needles continuously appearing in a haystack.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Bad actors are running automation to find misconfigured resources. As soon as you're putting things online, bad guys are finding them. The manual approach is no longer good enough. You have to use automation and policy as code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The attack surface on cloud is complex and ever expanding. The whole point of cloud is to go fast. All of it is deployed, configured and maintained via APIs. You have to use policy as code for any kind of security at scale on cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fugue is excited about open policy agent. Policy as code is a feedback loop around security. A good one will tell you if what you're doing is secure and meets policy. OPA started taking off when it became sponsored by the Cloud Native Computing foundation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Until OPA, you really kind of had three choices. One was a proprietary policy as code. The second was people trying to build policy libraries into general purpose languages. Rego is a domain specific language that can be used across lots of use cases. OPA is pretty good career skill.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A myth that needs busting is that to do policy as code in the cloud, you first have to do infrastructure as code. Policy as code really has to take priority over infrastructure has code. You need the same policies throughout the software development lifecycle.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fug shows how we're using OPA for cloud configuration. Using OPA, I can show errors in compliance. There's a version of this that is free forever for small scale deployments. You can go CTO, fug dot Co and use it for free forever.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                OPA is a language and then it's an evaluation of that language in the runtime. You can use it in two modes, those same implementation. Goldman Sachs, Intuit, Netflix, Pinterest, SAP are all using OPA. When you adopt a policy as code tool, you're making an investment that's going to last a long time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fugue is an open source toolset for OPA and terraform. Frego is a super fast evaluator of OPA policies on large data sets. It's written in Haskell. You can run it locally with a GitHub action.
              </li>
