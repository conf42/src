<p>Attacks on the OS supply chain are becoming more sophisticated. What are the essential first steps, and what should you focus on in the beginning? This raises the question of suitable methods and tools. At the same time, the company&rsquo;s strategic orientation must be included in this security strategy.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I want to talk with you about supply chain security. What are the key points, what are the tools you can use, how you can protect yourself. What you can do to integrate this one into your CI or in your software development process.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The whole supply chain is under attack right now. One thing is the geopolitics is more and more influencing these attacks against the supply chain. Now you are target because you are a political target.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A typical software supply chain for software developers. Common attacks against it. Source code, binaries and all the rest is something that is infrastructure and secured by infrastructure. All these components between each other should be in some kind of zero trust environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SalSA SLSA is an open source project and it's a documentation project. The levels from zero to four will describe how you can improve step by step your supply chain security. The project itself is currently in alpha state. But even in this alpha state the project is really really good.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Four main pillars of security testing and protection. Zest is a static application security protection. Dust is and RaSp are dynamic application security testing. RasP is just the last thing. You need very high skilled people to do this by yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The CI environment is a security gateway for everything. There's a good place to scan for security reasons or vulnerabilities. The SolarWinds hack infected 15,000 customers. For us, it means we have now two attacks. Where's the attacks?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                After the SolarWinds hack, JFrog has introduced built info. This is the full list of all ingredients that are used to build a binary. It includes immutable information and vulnerability information. You can scan on command line projects and on the other side you can scan binaries as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Inside the JFrog platform you will find not only the CBSS values, CBS two, three one. You will find the basic metrics as well. And there you can see if this is important for you. Have a look if there's a CVE number to get more information and decide if this vulnerability is critical.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Okay. Finally, I found my place for tonight. Perfect. If you want to contact me, use Twitter, LinkedIn. Otherwise, go to webinars workshops. Have a nice day, have the rest of your day. Relax.
