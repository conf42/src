                Erin McEwen is the director of engineering resilience at Zendesk. Charity majors is the co founder and CTO of Honeycomb. The observability platform to find critical issues in your infrastructure.

              <li>
                Today we're going to be talking about incident management. Charity has a lot of insight on to before the incident happens and what you're doing during the incident. Nora is the founder and CEO of Jelly IO. We kind of COVID the whole stack from responding to the incident to diagnosing it to understanding it afterwards.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                At Sundisk, I have a really amazing global incident management team. At Zendesk, I really serve as a conduit to our leadership. Having that calm demeanor and making sure that you're managing up in these situations is really important.

                Where would you say is the point at which it's worth starting to invest in that? It is pretty time consuming, and I think it depends on the commitments that you've made to your customers. What thresholds would you look for to say, okay, you should start really doing this for real?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What's the tolerance from the business for downtime or for impact? Something is better than nothing. Have a meeting at least once a quarter where you look at your risk path. Think about what is my end user's experience going to be like.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aaron: These days, I don't respond to incidents at all. We really have the philosophy of engineers write their own code in production. You should never put your monitoring and observability on the same hardware as your own production system. Every time you get alerted these days, it should be something genuinely new.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In your organization, you responded to your last incident in the depths of the weeds. By doing that, you're also giving everyone else a chance to do what they do best. Give people the time and space to become experts and to build their expertise. Step aside and let the next generation take over.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's just so much to learn about how to manage the people element of an incident. Wait for someone to escalate to you before you jump in. It's giving them the opportunity to teach others their skills. One of the things at Sundusk right now is reducing all of our mean times.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Erin, a lot of the folks that are listening have no idea the amazing learning from incidents culture that you are building at Zendesk. I'm curious what advice you might have for other folks looking to create an intentional learning culture.

              </li>

                In engineering, I feel like we have for a couple of decades now, been working on training. But other parts of the business, like sales and marketing, are still petrified to talk about mistakes in public. I keep trying to find out if there are companies out there who are trying to expand this beyond engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Charity: As much detail as I'm willing to go into is all of the detail. I feel like the more transparent you are, the more trust you'll build. In my experience, more detail is always better anyway.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We had this really interesting outage week or two ago. It took us a couple of days to figure out what was happening. Most of our interesting outages come from people who are using the system as intended, but in a really creative, weird way. Keep a close eye on your code while it's new.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Erin, can you tell us about a recent outage that you all had? Yes, and unlike charity, I am not the CEO, so I have to be a little bit more careful with some of the details that I possibly share. It's interesting to see how over time, your type of incidents and the nature of them can change.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Is this a security incident or is this a service incident? We downgraded the incident to a lower severity level. Security incidents also roll up through, like, service incidents or security incidents. Those can be the trickiest ones to figure out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aaron: I've been trying to come up with more creative metrics lately. One of them is how long someone spends waffling trying to decide if something's an incident. I think metrics have value in their own.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cool. Well, we are wrapping up time now. We probably have time for one more question. And there's like three really great ones. We're just going to have to do a second round at some point. We'll just end it on a cliffhanger.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cherry: I want to hear you talk about build versus buy with regard to tooling for any phase of the incident lifecycle. Telemetry is a big and really important part of the entire DevOps transformation. It's so much cheaper to pay someone else to run services than to have an enormous, sprawling engineering team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Darren: There's ways in which that we are getting more sophisticated in how we are creating our systems. And the dependency there is the web of things that everybody is connecting to and using and leveraging. Darren: What is best is starting from a risk perspective of really understanding what is your risk tolerance.
