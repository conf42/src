                Dmytro Hlotenko: Welcome to Comforted to Cloud Native 2024. In this session I will give you some specific details on AWS service. Tell you a story, how I was modernizing the already existing service. Please take a good position because it will be session with some details with a real life story.

                Mitri Glatanka is a cloud engineer of up it and how my colleagues call me Mr. Amazon. If you have any questions after this session, you will have my LinkedIn QR code at the end. You are welcome to send me the invitation.

                The topic of our discussion today is meteor contact plus. It's one of the applications that we are running on the backbone of AWS. With these services, it gives too many opportunities that you can utilize to deliver your business targets. What I absolutely love about AWS is that it does not create any headache.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloudwatch is amazing thing. If you will just take some time to analyze the logging, analyze existing metrics, maybe onboard some additional metrics, you will have lots of valuable data. Insights and dashboards. You can do a lot on AWS, but as you know, every press on AWS costs money.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                First cloud deployment that was in the company. Goal is to remove as much as blind spots as we can and improve efficiency. Right size also belongs to it, set up reliable, it should be taken into account for every production deployment. Security as I mentioned also is in this list and target for me was to get rid of operational overhead.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS fault injection service allows you to break parts of the setup granularly. Performance insights is even more valuable than the RGS performance monitoring. Most important, it's cheap out of the box, you have seven day trial.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The most important about running on AWS is to understand if you are taking the proper service for doing the thing that you need. I highly recommend use the ECs on the Fargate. It was important for us to avoid vendor lock and vendor lock.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fargate is a cool service. Usually you don't have the operational overhead, it just runs your stuff. The balance is extremely important and you should understand how your effort and price for the service compliance. For me it was crucial to use the instances with a better network performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Graviton instances give good performance for the good value. But you should understand if the effort to make your application running on gravitons can be covered by something else on AWS. Spot fleets are based sometimes 60, 70 80% cheaper than on demand.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Automation builds the new EC two image with the fresh image, updates the dependencies, then provisions. The application runs automated testing which is done by Lambdas too. When testing is successful I get full image that I'm ready to use. It takes into account business hours.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GP three is amazing drive which is able to provide you consistent performance without of any limits and it's even cheaper. Check if your RTS drive is encrypted. Latencies are also important because the response time directly affects your application performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Dima: If you want to have the RDS instance, take the graviton instance. You can save up to 50 $70 by using T 4G instead of M six g. What Aurora resolves, it eliminates the need of application re engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Yeah, so in the whole process it's important to communicate with your team. You must know the details because we can talk about the database. With AWS you can have everything covered and done. And this is amazing and I'm really excited to work with such service.
