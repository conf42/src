              <li>
                Josh: How do we make it so people are learning things ahead of time or as early as possible. Make the learning cheap and how can we do better? Josh: For a consultancy, you shouldn't be telling clients to do what you're unwilling to do yourselves.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every company has an response process that outlines what should happen in the instance of a breach or a potential breach. We made sure we planned out our red team approach. How do we measure performance in this? Have we got better or have we stayed the same?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The last known unknown for me is in terms of what lenses do people possess. Can they look at stuff through a security lens? Can they understand it that way? And when you think about unknowns, I mean, chaos engineering. It's about improving everyone together.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We disabled senior members access to our cloud environments. This was an opportunity for us to channel learning through our more junior members of staff. You want to see that when something serious is going on, that people will down tools and get involved.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                KMS is one of the fundamental services within AWS, or similarly in GCP or Azure. It is such a key part of actually able to protect within an account or a subscription or a project. The red team was locked out for about an hour and a half before they were finally contained. Now it's time to move from containment to remediation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The difference between a novice and a master is like a chess game. Novice players look at the board in pieces; the master sees patterns. Would you rather have a Novitz next to you or a master? The choice is yours.
