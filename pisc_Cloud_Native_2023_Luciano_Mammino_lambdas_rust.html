<p>Rust is taking the software engineering world by storm, but how does it affect serverless? In AWS it&rsquo;s not even a supported runtime, so how can we even use it&hellip; and should we even try to do that? Spoiler: yes we should and it&rsquo;s actually quite easy to get started with it!</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Luciano is a certified solution architect and also a Microsoft MVP. He works for a company called fourtheorem. We are especially focused on serverless, on AWS. If all this stuff is something that interests you, feel free to connect with me or send an email.

              <li>
                 serverless is a way of running applications in the cloud. Developers only pay for the actual usage of their application, not for the infrastructure. In my opinion, serverless increase team agility. But still, it doesn't scale indefinitely.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS lambdas is the fuzz function as a service offering that you get in AWS. It's basically a unit of compute that looks like a function. Lambdas can be triggered automatically by AWS when specific events occur. You can also invoke Lambda manually.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The cost model is generally a function of allocated memory multiplied by time. Running a lambdas for 15 minutes will cost you less than a cent. What about cpu? Cpu gets automatically configured proportional to the amount of memory that we allocate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you write a lambdas function, you generally call that a handler function. This is the function that represents your business logic that needs to respond to an event. There are a lot of languages that are supported. You can even write your own custom ones.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can get rust by doing a custom runtime written in rust. In this runtime you can also embed your own functions. This can have different pros and cons. The con is you don't really get a lot of security updates. But as a consequence of that you also get better performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Rust is a relatively new language. The first version was released in 2015. It is focused on performance and memory safety. It can be extended with third party commands. There is a great ecosystem. I'm quite impressed by the level of maturity of the tool can.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Rust combines the performance characteristics of rust with the ability of being a language that allows you to be very efficient memory wise. Cargo lambdas can cross compile for Linux. There are no null types and there is a great system to deal with errors. With rust you might be saving a lot of money.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cargo Lambda allows you to build serverless applications in an easier way. Sum is basically a yaml based infrastructure as code tool. It gives you a slightly simpler abstraction and shortcuts that will take care of generating cloudformation code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS sum works with cargo lambdas. Sam is trying to support the rust ecosystem. I recently built an application that allows me to see if there are earthquakes close to my family. Check out the repository if you want to try it out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With lambda and Rust, we are trying to maybe put a little bit more effort into learning a new language and writing code that is more optimized. Where do we find the sweet spot? It's not something you can kind of define in advance. The best way of finding thesweet spot is by trying different configurations for your lambdas.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Learning rust is not easy, but is it worth it? My personal answer is yes. I've personally been through this journey of learning rust for the last probably three years or three years and a half. Learning rust on its own, it's a good investment.

              </li>
