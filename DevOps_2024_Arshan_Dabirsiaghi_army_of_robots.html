              <li>
                Arshan Dabirsiaghi: Let's talk about generative AI and how that's going to affect the security of our software. Most people are using, what's been adopted as of now, has been this autocomplete feature. With a higher throughput, it'll come downstream consequences, some good, some bad.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The models produce, they produce insecure code, right? The statistics on the right help us understand that. Code bases are just way too big. Can't the models just generate secure code? Can we teach them to do that?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A diagram shows what is the secure development lifecycle, where does security fit in? Every time you commit some code, your pipeline runs. The process for acting on these results is very manual. Now imagine we have all the generative AI. What are the robots going to do when they find a static analysis finding?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Some studies say that developers outnumber security 101. The humans we have aren't cross skilled. Developers don't have great security skills. Security is a tough, complex, fast moving field. What are the things that can scale with the robots?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another strategy is to make it hard to exploit your insecure code. These rasp tools are injecting sensors and actuators into the application itself. These tools can help with many things, but there's still things that humans can't help with.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code modder is an open source code mod library for Java and Python today. The idea is a code mod is a little bit of code that changes a lot of code. What we're trying to do with this open source project is create 50 or 100 rules or code mods in order to upgrade code.
