    <meta property="og:description" content="Pandas has become extremely popular over the last few years, offering people the chance to analyze data within Python. Most of us work with text and numbers, and Pandas certainly knows how to do that very well.  But it also offers a powerful set of tools for working with time and dates. Using this functionality opens the door to new types of analysis."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Pandas has become extremely popular over the last few years, offering people the chance to analyze data within Python. Most of us work with text and numbers, and Pandas certainly knows how to do that very well.</p>
<p>But it also offers a powerful set of tools for working with time and dates. Using this functionality opens the door to new types of analysis.</p>

              <li>
                Ruben Lerner will talk about dates and times in pandas. He will use Jupyter to do so. Lerner is a full time Python trainer. You can learn more about him at learner Co. Il.

              <li>
                There are two different ways to measure time in programming. We can talk about a date time, aka a point in time, and a time interval,aka a time delta. It took a long time to understand that when we talk about time as people.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we're working with pandas, we actually deal with a lot of dates and time dates. These are taxi rides from New York City from 2015. Data science courses for individuals and corporations use this kind of data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Python allows you to parse dates and time. You can perform all sorts of calculations on them. Can provide a custom function that will read in the date and then spit out a daytime object based on its parsing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What about days of the week? Can we do that? Once again the distribution is totally wacky. You can't really make any sorts of serious decisions based on the data here. Or if you do make decisions, you'd better go check them based on actual more representative data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We can retrieve things based on an index. This might sound weird, but it means I can pull out all of the trips that took place on the 2 June 2015 at 1119 and 29 seconds. This allows me to really sort of find stuff based on those dates and times with a lot of flexibility.

              </li>
