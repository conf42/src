    <meta property="og:description" content="Modern applications are built to run on containerized infrastructure. Businesses are migrating their existing apps from traditional to container deployments.   In such a scenario, gaining end-to-end visibility of the complete container environment is a serious challenge for the IT Operators/Administrators. In this talk, we will cover the following:   - New-age business complexities - How applications are moving from monolith to microservice architecture. - Operational challenges in monitoring the container architecture. - Strategies to manage the life cycle of the containers efficiently.

                From what it was 20 years ago when I started as a product software developer to what it is today. Everything revolves around application building. The transformation from monolith architecture to microservices is what the industry is moving towards. Using function as a service is something that is picking up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are four layers. The topmost is the application layer and underneath is your platform layer. Underneath the bottom most is your infrastructure layer. End to end visibility across all these layers is important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                58% of people have felt that usage of kubernetes have helped them in improving the resource utilization. 46% have felt it is shortening your software development lifecycle. 28% feel that it has reduced the public cloud cost because it can be a combo. These are some of the benefits which people have seen.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lack of expertise as the top challenge that was quoted in the survey. The other important challenge is the deployment complexities. Scalability is an advantage, but you have to do it rightly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of the challenges can be taken care of with the help of tools and with monitoring needs. In metrics, availability and performance are the important metrics. The second pillar is traces. And the third pillar is logs. When anything goes wrong, we have to go for debugging.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Look for ice integration, integrability, customizability and extensibility. Site 24/7 is hosted on Zoho's data center. From end user layer to infrastructure layer, we have monitoring for all the needs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Start with a why, why, how and what. Do I really have to move to a cloud native technology? What are the pros and cons in moving to adopting a kubernetes or any other container orchestration. If you are clear with your why and choosing the right things in how to do the result, what is the end result?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Zoho at site 24/7 we make sure that we adopt all the latest technologies and pass that benefit to customers. Keep yourself updated. This is applicable for individuals as well as for business. Feel free to reach out to us and enjoy the rest of the session in the event.
