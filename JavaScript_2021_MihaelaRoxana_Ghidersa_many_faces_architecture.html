    <meta property="og:description" content="Too often we encounter the idea that software architecture is an esoteric concept, of which only the chosen ones, and at the right time, are allowed to discuss. Well, how about a little change of perspective?  With software development and users' needs evolving so fast, we don’t afford the luxury of rewriting systems from scratch just because teams fail to understand what they are building. Today’s software developers are tomorrow's architects. We must challenge them to step away from the IDE and understand how the architecture evolves in order to create a common and stable ground in terms of quality, performance, reliability, and scalability. At the same time, software architects need to step away from the abstractions and stay updated to the project development reality.  This session revolves around finding the right ways of intertwining up-front architecture, API design & coding while maintaining a continuous focus on architecture evolution."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Too often we encounter the idea that software architecture is an esoteric concept, of which only the chosen ones, and at the right time, are allowed to discuss. Well, how about a little change of perspective?</p>
<p>With software development and users&rsquo; needs evolving so fast, we don’t afford the luxury of rewriting systems from scratch just because teams fail to understand what they are building. Today’s software developers are tomorrow&rsquo;s architects. We must challenge them to step away from the IDE and understand how the architecture evolves in order to create a common and stable ground in terms of quality, performance, reliability, and scalability. At the same time, software architects need to step away from the abstractions and stay updated to the project development reality.</p>
<p>This session revolves around finding the right ways of intertwining up-front architecture, API design &amp; coding while maintaining a continuous focus on architecture evolution.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Mihaelaroxana Ghidersa is a software engineer. He says he's here to contribute to creating better teams and better project. He wants to put aside rules, positioning levels, never ending processes, and just look at a team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So what is architecture when it comes to clearly defining what architecture is? I think that architects is a base structure upon which we build. Step by step, one component after another, we create relationship between them. Consider that all this structure and decisions are being made while taking in consideration the whole picture of the product.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Software architecture is focused on the entire system. System design shapes things more at code level. Strong system design helps the development team be more efficient. Best solution is to build an architecture that anticipates change and evolution in a cost efficient way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are so many benefits to having a look from above at what you're working. By having this mindset switch, I was able to quit some of the teams that I've grown to believe in time. More important is to discuss them and break the toxic cycle.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You don't become architect only by receiving a promotion. Gradually working with some situations, growing the expertise, gaining the attitude in time, that will help you faces the role as it comes. There has been an evolution within this role from a traditional way of doing things to a more like hipster style.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The architecture is not being built by one person only. We need to quit this mindset that the architect architects the architecture. An architects uses the technical expertise of the team while also growing the team and with the team. Now we can consider that some of the myths were invalidated.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a difference between management and leadership. I really think that an architect should be a leader. A leader that has a very good overview, that can give insights both functional and nonfunctional. People really need to be in touch with the architects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An architect's role is both worrying about the important technical decisions, but also he has to lead, give the team a direction. A team with the same view and that finds it easy to collaborate is more engaged and delivers both quality and quantity. Being an architects is challenging and takes a lot of knowledge and experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 becoming a software architect is not something that you become automatically. Architecture is a part of the development process, part that later is taken over and implemented. In the end, software architecture is all about understanding how the system works. Can actually every developer be an architect?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As an architect, you need to understand the concept of the application from a developer's perspective. Stay close to the team and collaborate with the team from time to time. Architecture is not an esoteric concept, but it's not an easy road either.
              </li>
