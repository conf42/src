              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Adam Fulmanigan will talk about effective database observability. We will discuss how to effectively observe what's going on in databases. Adam Furmanek will be your guide for the next 40 minutes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Previously, 20 years ago, all we had was a very simple two tier architecture. The problem was that those things were not necessarily scalable. So then we started introducing DevOps. We wanted to put both teams side by side so they could closely cooperate and deploy things faster.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Microservices are much more complex, because they talk to many data sources. Because everything is now distributed, globalized, we can't easily tell how the things executed. We need to change the way how we structure our organization. Let's see how to reshape the world.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem with databases is we can't shift left our testing and our maintenance. Our ultimate goal is always self service. Make developers own their databases, make developers self serve their issues, and most importantly, finally fix all the problems as early as possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problems in databases typically fall into one of three areas. Code changes, schema changes and changing the way queries are executed. Building resilient testing suits and building all the processes around CI CD for that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another issues that may pop up when we are dealing with databases is around schema migrations. The problem with this is we will take our databases offline when going to production. And the worst part, if we wanted to avoid issues like this one, is that our unit tests don't even check Schema Migration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 indexes affect not only the query that read the data, but also the queries that modify the data. If we add an index, then we improve the performance of reading the data but at the same time we decrease the performance. How do we verify that during our CI CD pipeline?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Orms are great, but they really increase the complexity by hiding the complexity. There is a problem with load tests though, or many problems. To do a successful load test we need to basically run it for hours. How do we test all of that when going to production?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing to build the modern age observability in DevOps culture is to understand the context. All those inefficiencies, dashboards that do not show the story, configuration that is unclear can really be fixed. We just need to have proper databases, guardrails.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry is an open standard that gives us sdks that we can integrate with our applications to collect signals like locks, traces, metrics. We can enable open telemetry even without changing our applications. And we can also analyze schema migrations in CD pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need a solution that integrates with the source code, with CI CD, with our activity that we run locally or in pipelines or in production. We need to have proper observability that analyzes the metrics and figures out anomalies. This is modern observability in databases.
              </li>
