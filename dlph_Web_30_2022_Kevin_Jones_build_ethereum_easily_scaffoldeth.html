                Kevin Jones talks on how to build on Ethereum quickly, easily with Scaffold ETH. Would love to chat with you guys if you have any questions or if you're interested in any collaboration.

                Web three is this new concept of building applications that are decentralized. They are blockchain based using a ledger. Everything is transaction based and message based. You have to be careful with sensitive information on the blockchain. Its optimization is key.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Scaffoldeth is a project that allows you to build a smart contract on the Ethereum network. Here, we'll go through the steps that you need to go through to get started. We'll also do some tests to test your ability to build on the platform.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Scaffoldeth lets you access control of a smart contract using a public address. Instead of creating a hard coded address, we can import another smart contract. We can then use JavaScript to make contract calls as well. This is how we actually deploy our contract.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're not really doing anything super crazy here. All we're doing is just have a function that allows us to change a state. Let's instead make people pay a certain value to update the smart contract. Now let's figure out a way to get that money out because right now it's a black hole.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you deploy your smart contract to a testnet, you'll probably need to update your front end so that you can interact with that testnet. Next thing you want to do is anytime you deploy a smart contract, you probably want to verify your contract.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're going to use a browser based wallet called metamask. We wrote a smart contract, transferred ownership of the contract, updated state of the smart contract and generated a build. Now we can surge the application to our local host Ui.
              </li>
