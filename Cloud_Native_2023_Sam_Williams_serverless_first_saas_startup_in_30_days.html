                Sauk: I built a serverless SaaS startup in 30 days and how you can do exactly the same. Key challenges for him come down to finding a customer pain point and engaging on LinkedIn. A month later it hasn't all crashed and burned and we're still doing over $120 in monthly recurring revenue.

              <li>
                 LinkedIn is a growing tool, especially with Twitter recently going through all of its shenanigans. Where I should have done a lot better with the customer validation is actually talking with those potential customers. Other ways you can validate your customers are with like a landing page.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A chrome extension adds a button just like this to the LinkedIn payments section. Whenever you click it, it reads the text from the post, sends that to the API which generates the comment. By the time the beta launch was ready, 25 users were waiting to try out the product.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Marketing is the one issue with a 30 day challenge, and that is marketing. For the next couple of months, do a marketing month challenge, spend 30 days trying to find scalable marketing strategies. Find your unfair advantages and make the most of them.
