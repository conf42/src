              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to be talking about cloud KUs Engineering with AWS fault injection simulator. What I want to show you is how AWS and AWS ecosystem can help you on your chaos engineer journey. And in the end, I will spend a little bit of time just doing a simple demo.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As systems grows larger and more distributed, what is often a theoretical edge case can actually sometimes become real occurrences. Traditional test doesn't cover all the unknowns that distributed systems bring to the table and all the complexity that you have in production environments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS fault injection simulator is a fully managed chaos engineering as a service. It allows you to reproduce real world failures, whether the failure is as simple as stopping an instance. You can use pre existing experiments templates, and you can get started in minutes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fault injection simulator allows you to combine different actions that will inject failure both in parallel or in sequence. It integrates natively with AWS Cloudwatch, and it has built in rollbacks as well. Make sure only the right people within your organization have access to run those experiments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Actions are default injection actions executing during the experiment. Action types can include fault types, target resources, and timing. Some host level actions on EC two instance are performed through system manage agent.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An experiment template includes an action, a target and optional information like stop condition alarms. Experiments are simply a snapshot of the experiment template when it was first launched. You can do both parallel and sequential actions, and you can configure multiple stop conditions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos engineering is a process of rehearsing ahead of an event by creating an anticipated conditions and then observing how effective the teams and system respond. Another use case is automated experiments based on an event trigger idea. Using event driven trigger experiments, we can verify the behavior.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you are interested and you would like to use fault injection simulator within your organizations, please check out these resources. The chaos Engineer workshop. You can check the file injection simulator documentation and also there are a GitHub repository that is publicly that has a lot of examples. I'll do a simple demo just showing the console.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A simple example will be an application that has two EC, two instances being managed by an auto scaling group. I'll show you step by step how you can create that using fault injection simulator. And then we're going to look at some of the results.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can look at the targets, targets are looking to terminate two instances that have this specific resource stack and having this filter. If I click on this instance, it just redirects to that one that has the specific tag that we are searching. So it's going to select one of those when I start experiment to actually go MQ.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A simple script that is generating synthetic traffic to my instance. Now it starts the experiment and then it terminates the instance. If something goes outside your control, you have the ability to stop that experiment again. But while these experiments is ongoing, it's very simple.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
