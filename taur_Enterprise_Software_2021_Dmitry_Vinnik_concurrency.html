    <meta property="og:description" content="Callback hell is a known way to give any JavaScript developer nightmares. However, Java developers are not much better off since anything concurrency and multithreading related gives us cold sweats.   With Threads and Runnables being the very first (and often last) things we used in Java, these classes gave many of us impression of and appreciation for complexities of concurrency. As a result, many developers abandoned the idea of ever touching thread management in Java and focused on a single-threaded development."/>

<p>Callback hell is a known way to give any JavaScript developer nightmares. However, Java developers are not much better off since anything concurrency and multithreading related gives us cold sweats.</p>
<p>With Threads and Runnables being the very first (and often last) things we used in Java, these classes gave many of us impression of and appreciation for complexities of concurrency. As a result, many developers abandoned the idea of ever touching thread management in Java and focused on a single-threaded development.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we'll talk about concurrency in Java. I'll use some of the Facebook open source projects in Android space to showcase lessons. So let's get started.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Concurrency is a new reality. It's not something you have to adopt anymore, it's already here. As long as you're not aware of how to use it, how it can improve your workflow. We'll discuss misconceptions in concurrency and also workflows, how and why they used in Java.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I always push people to consider implementing design for concurrency. It's the fact that you stop programming by coincidence. You design by contract. You try to avoid temporal coupling. You need to really work on making it immutable and atomic as possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Multithreading, what forms can it take? There are so many different ideas and forms. I'd like to discuss concurrency form, parallel form, and asynchronous forms.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Concurrency, as I will show in this talk, has improved significantly in the past couple of years. One of the big additions were thread local atomic operations, thread safe collections, and a lot more other things. While concurrency still doesn't come for free.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Future and callable are very important. Executive framework really helps with things like threads management and implements this declarative model. It really relies on these threads pool. factories. Executor factories are amazing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is no result chaining, so it's not real promises. You have to make a call for it, wait for tasks to complete, and only then handle it. Exception handling is fairly complex when dealing with futures. There are many issues, but no worries, right?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 completeable future gets you everything that future has, but now has additional interface implementation, which is completion stage. It allows you to transform, compose, chain, and combine basically anything that future had issues with. It's perfect for more intense concurrency.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another example of Facebook open source library that I'll like to showcase really quickly is Litho. Litho is a great declarative framework for UI and Android. Think about designing for concurrency. Even if you're not ready for it, just continue learning.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
