    <meta property="og:description" content="In this session, we will demonstrate how common vulnerabilities in the Java eco-system are exploited on a daily base by live hacking real-world application libraries. All the examples used are commonly known exploits, some more famous than others, such as Apache Struts and Spring break remote code execution vulnerabilities.   By exploiting them and showing you how you can be attacked, before showing you how to protect yourself, you will have a better understanding of why and how security focus and DevSecOps is essential for every developer."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>In this session, we will demonstrate how common vulnerabilities in the Java eco-system are exploited on a daily base by live hacking real-world application libraries. All the examples used are commonly known exploits, some more famous than others, such as Apache Struts and Spring break remote code execution vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>By exploiting them and showing you how you can be attacked, before showing you how to protect yourself, you will have a better understanding of why and how security focus and DevSecOps is essential for every developer.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Security should be one of the first things that comes into mind when you create Java software. In my opinion, security should be part of the development lifecycle, just like scalability and maintainability. But it is not. That's why the word devsecops is emphasizing on that security part.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is a lack of security focus throughout the whole application lifecycle. Security is still a siloed thing. It is not something that is adopted by the development teams or by the DevOps teams. In the end, we do not want customer data that is in our application is compromised.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How much of the code that you put into production is actually the code you have written? In a lot of companies, once a dependency is in, it never gets out. We need to be aware of this as well when we use open source available software.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Between 2018 and 2019, NPM grew tremendously. Most of the vulnerabilities that are found are indirect. Who is responsible for security? A lot of people think and believe that the developer has a fair share. Who uses Docker? There are a lot of vulnerabilities in that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A small code application in node JS is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. If you can read into files, you can snoop into files that are there. Even more information is available on the Internet.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The application can upload files, which is interesting, and it can upload zip files. Every title goes into that native to ASCII file and will be transformed into muhaha gotcha. This is because I'm using a zip library to unzip my file.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using spring data rest I can use this annotation repository rest resource and that transforms my crud repository into a rest repository and gives me a bunch of endpoints. If I can do this, I can work on for instance my front end which might be a mobile app or whatever. But there's an issue with that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Just like children, we need to play along. Why not scan your stuff? Why not create tests that are security focused? Snyk wants to be developer first. We can create scanning tools for you. And we can do that in every single step of your pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make sure that in every step of your development lifecycle you have security in place. If you want to have more best practices on how to create good Java applications, visit our sneak blog. We're currently asking you to do a Java survey.
