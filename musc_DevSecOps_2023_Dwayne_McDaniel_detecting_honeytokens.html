<p>Ever wish you could set traps for intruders in your environment? While you can&rsquo;t rig explosions or rolling boulders when someone attacks your servers, you can set up false credentials that trigger alarms you can act against. That is the whole idea behind honeytokens! This talk will get you started.</p>

                Dwayne McDaniel: Attackers want your credentials. We're up against a lot of threats out there in the world. If they get those credentials, some bad things can happen. He tells a couple of horror stories and they might be a little disconcerting, a little scary.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hackers are stealing data from open networks, government networks, military networks. The idea of honeypots has become a mainstream conversation in computer security. In 2016, AWS added tokens into their system. This is a definitive moment in the history of hacking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Honey token is a decoy credential that doesn't allow any real access. It looks identical to a real credential, to an attacker or to anybody else. If it's used, it exposes that it's being used through an alert. Here's how you build them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Put honey tokens in private environments. Anywhere where someone outside of your organization shouldn't have access. Do think in terms of scaling this with automation. It's not a one off exercise.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Start thinking about honey tokens if you're going to deploy them. Think long term and think how do we do this at a regular pace. If you added one new honey token per sprint, you'll get a lot of coverage in a year's time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's really hard to win if you only play defense. What we need to do is start actively kicking people out faster. Check out the security repo podcast. Highly recommend it.
