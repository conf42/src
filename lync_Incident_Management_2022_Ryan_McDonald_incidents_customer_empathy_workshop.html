    <meta property="og:description" content="Organizations are focusing on incidents more than ever but failing to leverage them to their full potential. But by framing incidents and post-incident reviews as customer empathy-building opportunities, we can facilitate more creative technical problem-solving, unlock improvements to your response process, and enable organizational agility that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. This talk will deliver actionable methods to increase customer empathy before, during, and after an incident."/>

<p>Organizations are focusing on incidents more than ever but failing to leverage them to their full potential. But by framing incidents and post-incident reviews as customer empathy-building opportunities, we can facilitate more creative technical problem-solving, unlock improvements to your response process, and enable organizational agility that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. This talk will deliver actionable methods to increase customer empathy before, during, and after an incident.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Ryan McDonald is a responder advocate for firehydrant. He says incidents have been a persistent part of his professional life. Working in customer success as a customer success engineer directly with customers has been enlightening.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we focus on customer empathy, we can improve customer experience during an incident. This can lead to better working relationships with other responder organizations, and better processes and product improvements from incidents. Here are some concrete actions that have helped me drive these outcomes in the organizations that I've been part of.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So collecting and displaying customer impact prominently during can incidents is the next thing that I found adds a ton of value. Oftentimes in incidents response is not to resolve the issue or even understand it, but just to stop the bleeding, stop the pain for our customers. This can directly impact business metrics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point is to not just collaborate, but partner with your support organization. By proactively building rapport with support, you can help smooth over a lot of these things. Create really clean interfaces and clear expectations for communications with support.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it comes to partnering with your support organization, try and let support behind the curtain more during incidents. Support can provide additional evidence through direct testing. intentionally nurturing your support folks creates a pool of candidates that can lead to your next great hire.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing is making space for all of the responders. Bringing them in to these post incident reviews or incident retrospectives can be a great way to ensure that you understand what their concerns are. These things can feed into both your processes and your product in ways that you might not expect.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For sufficiently large incidents, plan in advance on having multiple meetings or multiple sessions to cover different themes. Incidents, they're not optional right? Here in these complex domains that we live and work. Taking the time to really dig deep and learn about different ways that things are or are not working can be key.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The last item here is to capture all of your improvements, not just the technical ones. By broadening our incident retrospectives, we can have deeper learning, better process, and better product improvements.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                By partnering with your support organization, we can have more aligned and better responses. By cracking open your retrospectives, you can enable better process and product prioritization. I like to think about customer empathy as an organizational lubricant. Let me know how it goes.
