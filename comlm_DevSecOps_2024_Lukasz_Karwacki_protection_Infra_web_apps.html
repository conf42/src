    <meta property="og:description" content="In today’s complex threat landscape, safeguarding web applications and infrastructure requires an integrated security approach. Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) solutions are critical for defending against sophisticated application layers. However, without robust DDoS protection, organizations remain vulnerable to high-volume attacks that can cripple their infrastructure and render applications inaccessible.This presentation explores why combining WAAP with DDoS protection is essential for comprehensive security. Attendees will learn how this dual approach ensures both application-layer and network-layer resilience and minimizes risks. Case studies and actionable strategies will highlight how businesses can achieve a unified, scalable defense against modern cyber threats in 2025."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>In today’s complex threat landscape, safeguarding web applications and infrastructure requires an integrated security approach. Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) solutions are critical for defending against sophisticated application layers. However, without robust DDoS protection, organizations remain vulnerable to high-volume attacks that can cripple their infrastructure and render applications inaccessible.This presentation explores why combining WAAP with DDoS protection is essential for comprehensive security. Attendees will learn how this dual approach ensures both application-layer and network-layer resilience and minimizes risks. Case studies and actionable strategies will highlight how businesses can achieve a unified, scalable defense against modern cyber threats in 2025.</p>
