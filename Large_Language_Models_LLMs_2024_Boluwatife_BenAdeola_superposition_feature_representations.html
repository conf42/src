              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Bolu: Today I'm going to talk about superposition in neural network representations. How do neural networks learn which representations to use for inputs? And how are these inputs passed around in the computation?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Just because things aren't auto collection numbers doesn't necessarily mean that they are linear, right? Linearity is a very particular statement about how different entities interact. And there was an interesting paper that showed up to say that actually, yes, abstract things like functions can be encoded.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The recommendation is distinct to algorithmic interpretation, interpretability. Think of the linear composition as just a compression scheme for how all this information is packed together. As these tools become more mature to understand what's happening, we get to do different things, like everything from mind reading to mind control.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Neural networks are able to do this because they exploit feature sparsity and the relative feature importance. Exploring this puzzle suggests a way forward on tackling what exactly is going on.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The paper I shared basically tries to do this by tackling a smaller model. They use something called a sparse encoder and a BSN Autoencoder. Since this information is flowing through our entire network, each discrete component is going to need to do some version of this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So basically that would mean if again, with the network of the quarter on the right, if the, on the input and output was 512 different like neurons. They were able to extract way over 100,000 reasonable features. And the future of this work could basically look like scaling up larger models and uncover more useful features.
