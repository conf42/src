    <meta property="og:description" content="_Platform Engineering_ is the latest buzzword in the modern software engineering world. It is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. The holy grail for platform engineering today is to achieve the most effective “Internal Developer Platform” (IDP) that enables the rest of the developers in the company to be as effective as possible. Can this job be accomplished with engineering skills alone? Platform intersects with product in two ways: first, the platform must be optimized for supporting the development of the company-specific product. Second, the platform has to be built with a product mindset and practices for it to be adopted by its users - the developers. In this session, we will discuss how to build an engineering platform that your engineers will actually want to use. We will go over standard product practices to use when creating the developer platform, and also the importance of making sure your IDP actually helps developers build the company’s products faster and better. We will define the role of the platform product manager (PPM), and the importance he plays in ensuring our platform is not a glorified Rube Goldberg machine. In this session you will learn: - What is platform engineering? Is it just a new name for DevOps? - What makes an IDP and a platform team successful? - Who is the PPM? why is he important? How do I convince my head of product we need one? - Practices you can use to build a successful platform, and pitfalls to avoid."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p><em>Platform Engineering</em> is the latest buzzword in the modern software engineering world. It is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. The holy grail for platform engineering today is to achieve the most effective “Internal Developer Platform” (IDP) that enables the rest of the developers in the company to be as effective as possible. Can this job be accomplished with engineering skills alone?
Platform intersects with product in two ways: first, the platform must be optimized for supporting the development of the company-specific product. Second, the platform has to be built with a product mindset and practices for it to be adopted by its users - the developers. In this session, we will discuss how to build an engineering platform that your engineers will actually want to use. We will go over standard product practices to use when creating the developer platform, and also the importance of making sure your IDP actually helps developers build the company’s products faster and better. We will define the role of the platform product manager (PPM), and the importance he plays in ensuring our platform is not a glorified Rube Goldberg machine.
In this session you will learn:
- What is platform engineering? Is it just a new name for DevOps?
- What makes an IDP and a platform team successful?
- Who is the PPM? why is he important? How do I convince my head of product we need one?
- Practices you can use to build a successful platform, and pitfalls to avoid.</p>

              <li>
                Gal Bashan: Today I want to convince you all that platform engineering is all about product. He says that only around 3% of the organizations were able to achieve the DevOps ideal. Bashan asks how do we avoid this in two years from now?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Epsagon was a company that was building a lot with serverless technologies. Its entire backend was based on Lambda, and we had a lot of kinesis streams. A senior developer wanted to build a tool that will help developers in our company. But it wasn't adopted because this wasn't a real problem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The platform has to solve a problem that your developers has. Just because we can solve something doesn't mean that we should solve something. Our developers know what troubles them in their day two day. When you're building the solution, you should focus on value.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The takeaway here is that agile is still valid. Even when we're building a platform and not a user facing product. We should always build an MVP and let the user try it before building the next has.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to build a good IDP, we need to first validate the problems that our developers have. Because it is a product, we should have a product manager that leads it and makes sure that it is valuable and for our internal users. This product manager has to be measured against the success criteria.
