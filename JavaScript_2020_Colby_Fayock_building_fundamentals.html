    <meta property="og:description" content="A growing trend in the front end world is the idea that you can dive right in to Javascript and succeed. For better or worse you probably can, but you’re building on top of a fragile foundation. We’ll talk about how you can level up your Javascript by getting back to the basics of HTML and CSS.  Seasoned and beginner alike, developers have a habit of jumping right into a framework or new technology that makes a lot of promises while also glazing over important fundamentals that without, tend to hold back a website or application’s potential. Without some basic knowledge of HTML, you might inadvertently exclude people from learning about your company through your website due to poor accessibility. Lacking an understanding or simply being afraid of CSS, you might be more prone to add unnecessary libraries on top of libraries that just add to the weight of the page, impacting how quickly your app can load."/>

<p>A growing trend in the front end world is the idea that you can dive right in to Javascript and succeed. For better or worse you probably can, but you’re building on top of a fragile foundation. We’ll talk about how you can level up your Javascript by getting back to the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Seasoned and beginner alike, developers have a habit of jumping right into a framework or new technology that makes a lot of promises while also glazing over important fundamentals that without, tend to hold back a website or application’s potential. Without some basic knowledge of HTML, you might inadvertently exclude people from learning about your company through your website due to poor accessibility. Lacking an understanding or simply being afraid of CSS, you might be more prone to add unnecessary libraries on top of libraries that just add to the weight of the page, impacting how quickly your app can load.</p>

                Learn how you can level up with the fundamentals of web development. I work on the UX and front end side of things at element 84. You can find me pretty much anywhere on the web by just googling my name.

                Two friends are trying to switch careers and give coding a try. They both try to find a boot camp to dive right in. Luckily they both get a call back for a code challenge. Their task is to take a mockup and transform it into a website.

                Mark struggled to get a react app going during an interview. Luke started with some basic HTML to create a header. With all of that, Luke ended up with a lot more progress than Mark. I've personally sat through interviews watching candidates struggle through these exact same types of challenges.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It's the essential building block of all website. With react and JSX we can really write any HTML we want. We just now have tooling to provide us with a better way to generate it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 CSS stands for cascading style sheets. I'm still a fan of writing my CSS outside of my Javascript. SEO stands for search engine optimization. Our ultimate goal with SEO is to present our content in a way that makes it easy for search engines like Google to understand.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The World Health Organization estimates that 15% of the world has some sort of disability. By using proper semantic HTML, you're actually helping screen readers understand the hierarchy of your website. It doesn't take much more of an effort, if at all, to develop with accessibility in mind.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We don't always need extravagant solutions to get our code to work the way we want it to. Sometimes there's a simpler way to do things that we're struggling to do with JavaScript. People are also building out some awesome things with just some HTML and CSS.

                Freecodecamp is a huge community of learners who are trying to teach themselves to code. YouTube also has a ton of great content that's ready to watch. There's a ton you can do without diving headfirst right into JavaScript.
