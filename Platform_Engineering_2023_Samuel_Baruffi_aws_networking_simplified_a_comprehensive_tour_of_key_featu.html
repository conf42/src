              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 AWS AWS AWS Networking simplified a comprehensive tour key features. We're mostly going to be talking about how can you understand some of the core networking fundamentals. Some of the features that you can use for your organization or your personal use.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Samuel Barufi is a senior solutions architect with AWS. He talks about empowering endpoints, gateways and global connectivity. Also talks about a new service introduced last year to simplify service to service connectivity.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have launch and available for you as a customer to consume 32 different regions across the globe. All regions are compromised of multiple availability zones for high availability and scalability. The latest region that was made available a couple weeks ago was Israel. How does AWS backbone infrastructure treats fault tolerance?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Virtual private cloud, also known as VPC, is your own private cloud. VPC is a regional construct, you are going to choose different availability zones. Elastic cloud compute is actually going to be hosted on a specific data center.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Vpcs can have secondary cider blocks. When you create subnets you have IP addresses that are reserved. With an elastic IP address, that IP address is reserved for your account and you can always associate to a specific EC two instance or change in the future.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To use ipv six, you can run I-P-V six and public ipv four s at the same time. How does intravpc routing works? By default security groups are attached to resources like Ectus. Unless you know what you're doing, you should always avoid doing zero zero.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Net gateway allows private subnets that don't have public IP address to have outbound connectivity. Another type of Internet gateway is called the egress only Internet gateway. You can use a combination of these tools to achieve the specific use case.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AWS released a service called Transit Gateway instead of having that complexity network of multiple peers. With transit gateway, you can create transit gateway peering attachments for each VPC. And then in this scenario and this diagram, you are actually able to consume across different regions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are two types of VPC endpoints. With interface endpoint, every time you have a resource that wants to talk to a specific API or a specific resource on AWS, you go directly. With gateway endpoint, you can associate your interface endpoint through multiple subnets. You can also create specific endpoint policies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Private link is the technology that runs on top of the VPC interface endpoint. You can create specific solutions for your like using the same backbone network private connectivity of AWS. So hopefully you can use this to really provide better private connectivity for your customers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Once you have a global connectivity, maybe hybrid cloud, what are the options available for you to consume? Let's talk about hybrid connectivity and DNS. First we are going to talk about direct Connect site to site client VPN and then browse 53.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon route 53 is the DNS service on AWS and Amazon Route 53 resolver allows domain name resolutions to be done internally. You can also support resource based private VPC. By default those are enabled.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                VPC lattice VPC lattices allows you to have a service mesh for cross account cross VPC connections. By default it works at a layer seven protocol so you know how to do proper HTTP routing and so forth. You can have very complex and fine grained permissions to achieve what we call zero trust.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                VPC flow logs. Provides all the VPC data like the traffic. If you enable the traffic that is going on, your VPC can be logged on a very specific format. Another interesting feature that you can enable on VPC is called the traffic mirroring. Can create a lot of specific security inspections in real time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And that concludes my presentation. I hope you were able to learn some of the key components. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. I appreciate your time and thank you so much.
