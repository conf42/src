              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Tanya Jenka: Instant response for developers and DevOps folks, too. She used to do appsec full time. Now she's head of education and community at Semgrap. Says security incidents are the most expensive way to deal with a vulnerability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is incident response? It's an organized approach of addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or an IT incident. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits the damage and reduces the recovery time and costs. One story is something where something bad happens to children.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Like any piece of software, it needs to be secure. Developers are our first line of defense in that matter. Without your buy in, us security folks are lost. Here are five things we need from you during a security incident.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If there's something that you're like, that's just so weird, why is this happening? Call us. If we call you into a security incident, please don't leave for the day without telling us. This is an emergency.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Unless someone else needs to know a specific thing about the security incident, don't tell them. Your boss does not have the right to know. They can go ask the security team for more details. But if they're like, hey, show me the code, no.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Tanya: I was late for work one day because I had a dentist appointment. She says a building that was made of concrete was infected with malware. Employees were allowed to watch the Winter Olympics at work. Tanya: This is ridiculous.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you become an incident responder, you are accepting a certain amount of risk. These are the five things that we need you to know as incident responders. Don't leave the premises without telling us. If you see something, just call us and we will come and help.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every single Monday on Twitter, on Blue sky, and on infosec exchange server for Mastodon, I run a mentoring program. We hack purple community is free. If you join the newsletter, you will be invited to all of the cool events that we do do every single month.
