            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Pranav: We're basically going to be talking about the offensive attacks and exploits possible against llms, as well as LLM defenses. Third part would be more from a developer standpoint and user standpoint of how you can defend your LLM apps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pranav: If you haven't done your taxes, get your taxes done after my talk. Most importantly, don't rely on an LLM to do it. llms have model hallucination issues, so it can hallucinate tax code that doesn't exist.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 LLM simply stands for a large language model. GPT and chat GPT stands for generative, pre trained transformers. Transformers are the machine learning architecture that is used underlying a lot of these llms. Most popularly, we have seen it been used in chatbots.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 prompt engineering is a way to improve chances of the desired output you want to receive from an LLM. The goal of it is you give it more context. There are a lot of other resources to learn how to prompt better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Zero shot prompting is, in my opinion, more common sense than a prompt engineering method. Chain of thought prompting was created to help llms solve analytical problems. Using those examples, it can print stuff in consistent style.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of LLM apps are vulnerable to prompt engineering attacks. Today I want to talk about four of those top ten vulnerabilities. I'm going to cover how to exploit these, how to create these attacks, as well as how to defend yourself. This is for educational purposes only.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A prompt injection is basically not entering input that's expected and being able to exploit it to give me something that's unexpected. This is kind of the same process we call reconnaissance in red teaming in cybersecurity. How does this play out in real life?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Insecure output handling is one of the oauth top ten attacks. AI is awesome for code generation. But the issue is what happens when the code that's generated is malicious. How do you defend yourself against these kinds of attacks?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next OwAsp top ten vulnerability is sensitive information data disclosure. PII disclosure in llms happens a lot. Some of the defenses of sensitive information disclosure is just redacting user input.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Prompt jailbreaking is a way through which you can get an LLM to the role player, act in a different personality. This enables it to print out or generate text that is illegal, or talks about illicit stuff. Only prompt defense is training another model to classify user inputs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Audit logging is extremely important every time you fine tune your models. Another place to put it at is in user chat. Even in sensitive data use cases, you can still redact a lot of the personal data. How can you stay secure with your LLM apps even after implementing all of these?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A great resource for learning prompt engineering, prompt hacking I highly recommend is learnprompting. org dot. If the link is down, you can always access the open source repository by going to git dot new chatgpt. Happy to connect and answer any questions that you shoot my way.
