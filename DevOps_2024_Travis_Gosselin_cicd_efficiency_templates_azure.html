                Hey everybody, and welcome to this session on maximizing CI CD efficiency. We're going to dive into reusable templates, specifically with azure pipelines, and how to make the best out of it. And love this quote from David Farley is that releasing software is too often an art.

              <li>
                Travis: My focus at SPS commerce is specifically on developer experience. We're focusing on how you get that production, sorry, that value to production. How you share code effectively across the organization can have a large impact. Having a standardized CI CD with effective methods can be essential.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                YAML templates in general are not something you should avoid if you're worried about writing too much YAmL. There are so many advantages in doing so that it deems necessary. It's just something that you need to look forward to using and see how it fits in your organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea of code reuse is really, really important across your organization, especially not just in your pipelines, but also in your code distribution. In deployment we can look at security constraints, change management, artifact promotion, and a lot of these are the same across every pipelines. That's where the templates play an important role.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A pipeline is made up of a series of jobs. Jobs run on a particular machine or agent in some location. Each job then executes aseries of steps or tasks. There's two types of jobs that we need to be concerned with. The first type is a regular job and the second type is called a deployment job.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do we define a template? Well, normally in a pipeline, you would define an Azure pipelines YaMl file. template expressions allow us to go one step further with how we think about our parameters. You can also use these functions to alter or modify the parameters that we might want to apply.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea that I want to include a template remotely and remote is important because it means that I can make use of it across multiple repositories without moving it around. There are different organizational template versioning strategies you might want to consider.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Extending a template works with the key command. Extend basically allows you to provide one template with a series of parameters. There's more powerful capability if we go into advanced templating. This can help with security and some security aspects and limiting what teams can do.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You don't want to start with the great pyramid. Some questions we're still figuring out, how far do you abstract some of these templates. Is abstracting too much knowledge a bad thing? There's lots of components inside Azure DevOps that you can take advantage of.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The progression towards yaML templates and workflows that you can reuse not just within your team but across your organization are pivotal. When done well, software is invisible and your templates can be invisible to your teams that need to use them.
