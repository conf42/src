    <meta property="og:description" content="Join Jamie Dicken and Aaron Rinehart to learn about how they implemented Security Chaos Engineering as a practice at their organizations to proactively discover system weakness before they were taken advantage of by malicious adversaries.  In this session Jamie and Aaron will introduce a new concept known as Security Chaos Engineering and share their experiences in  applying Security Chaos Engineering to create highly secure, performant, and resilient distributed systems."/>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Aaron Reinhardt is the CTO and founder of a company called Verica. Jamie Dicken is the manager of security engineering at Cardinal Health. They will unite SRE and security chaos engineering. All of the disciplines are really related and one can't be successful without the others.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 systems engineering is messy. Throughout a system's life, complexity has a way of sneaking in. As time goes on, those problems just compound as new change is introduced into the system. Through failure, we discover that we have far more dependencies and complexities than we ever could have imagined.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We used to pull up an infrastructure diagram of one of our systems. But maybe it doesn't even represent the system that was actually deployed to production. Even if you do have documentation, you need to wonder about how it gets updated. There are going to be plenty of problems that you don't even anticipate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a vast difference between what we believe our systems are and what they are in reality. The only way to really understand that complex system is to interact with it. And that's really the heart of chaos engineering. It's really about a new approach to learning.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is a difference between continuous fixing and continuous learning. What we're trying to do is continuously learn about our systems. With chaos engineering, we can learn about the system in a controlled way and not incur pain. It's also kind of about a change in mindset.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos experiments are focused, really on accidents and mistakes that engineers make. What we're trying to do is proactively clean up the low hanging fruit so those attacks can't become successful. It is about continuous security verification.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With chaos engineering, we're not waiting for something to happen. We're proactively introducing a signal into the system. Every chaos engineering experiment has compliance value. We'll talk about instant response next.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cardinal Health began its security chaos engineering journey in the summer of last year. The name comes from bringing continuous verification and validation to Cardinal health. The process includes five steps to identify technical security gaps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                O'Reilly report coming later this year about the discipline. Security chaos engineering is about testing your own systems. You can practice this on a system that's either a giant monolith or that's radically distributed with tons of microservices. Once you understand security chaos engineering, it's really possible to start.
