    <meta property="og:description" content="Good teams ship fast to innovate. Great ones ship fast, while keeping quality at a high level. Iâ€™ll share my experience working in Big Tech, innovating and moving fast while building/maintaining very large-scale distributed systems. We'll start from the big picture, how to approach such challenges, a bit of complexity theory and then zoom in to more technical concepts that can be applied in different scenarios. You will take away techniques and concepts to apply on your next big challenge. Some are: - The kind of team culture that will maximise your chances for success - How to plan such work, while aiming to move really fast - Common trade-offs you will face and how to approach them - Resiliency techniques that can save lots of time & effort down the road - How to adopt systems thinking on our day-to-day as a team"/>

<p>Good teams ship fast to innovate. Great ones ship fast, while keeping quality at a high level.
Iâ€™ll share my experience working in Big Tech, innovating and moving fast while building/maintaining very large-scale distributed systems.
We&rsquo;ll start from the big picture, how to approach such challenges, a bit of complexity theory and then zoom in to more technical concepts that can be applied in different scenarios.
You will take away techniques and concepts to apply on your next big challenge. Some are:
- The kind of team culture that will maximise your chances for success
- How to plan such work, while aiming to move really fast - Common trade-offs you will face and how to approach them
- Resiliency techniques that can save lots of time &amp; effort down the road
- How to adopt systems thinking on our day-to-day as a team</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Welcome to my talk. I'm recording this video from Spain where I'm based. If you have any questions, comments, ideas, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me after the talk.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Facebook adopted move fast with stable infra. But different times call for different measures. When you ship things that every once in a while breaks, and when you break things you have to go fix them. This could bring down the morale of your teams a lot.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I've been working in tech for ten teams for the past ten years as a software engineer. Now I'm building in Shopify and I'm part of the shop app team. Set your priorities clear in the beginning will make your team work on the most important thing at any given time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The concept was coined by my former employer, thoughtworks. It's called evolutionary architecture. It makes architecture a living entity. We can apply things function to our architecture and see if it matches our priorities. This is a good heuristic for designing a base architecture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aims to start a base level of architecture with a lower complexity so that it's really faster and easier to grow and let the architecture evolve. Spending 10% extra time to build the architecture with the lower complexity will avoid 90% of the issues later otherwise.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                First do the things that has high value and high complexity. You should prioritize these type of parts. Parts that are complex to build, risky parts that holds unknown. I think you should really consider having a walking skeleton from week one.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 integrations is usually in this big, complex system. These are the parts where most incidents and issues occur. How the secure integrations are two, like downstream integrations versus upstream integrations. One thing that is really important is to implement them in the beginning.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So the next things is testing. There are two things we need to consider. Load and diversity. One good practice for this is shadow releasing. This is a really good way of testing that will give you load and most importantly diversity.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So the next one is building for resilience. I think it's a really good practice to map out possible problematic and error scenarios. It's really crucial and super helpful to make the decision how to react to these before they actually happen. Other good patterns is auto scaling warm up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The concept of immutability is getting highly popular in the last ten years with data storages. The next one is compartmentalizing. Let us deprioritize less important non time sensor tasks. And the last one is ones time configuration management.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 edit while you build. We should have observability from day one and alerting as well included into this. Performance testing is great for this. Put your system under high load, high stress. If the performance is something critical for you, start testing early.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can apply to your day to day job. Reach out to me in my email or via LinkedIn. I hope you enjoyed it. Really happy for the chance and hope to hear from you.
