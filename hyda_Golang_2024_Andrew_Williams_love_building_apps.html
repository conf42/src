<p>Building apps is tough and involves lots of languages to reach multiple platforms - unless you build with Go and let the tools do the hard work!
This talk covers the joy I experienced when starting to build graphical apps using Go and how any developer can feel the same with the Fyne toolkit.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Andrew Williams talks about how Go taught him to love building applications again. He founded the fine project when he started being a Go developer early in 2018. Now he is also the CEO at Finelabs, where he builds products to help businesses get more out of their applications.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most graphical systems that you see now have a fairly substantial C heritage in them. There are modern alternatives available, but they are typically platform specific. Go is providing a great way to lower the barrier of entry to building graphical applications.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 find toolkit aims to deliver the simplest way for developing beautiful and user friendly native graphical applications for desktop, mobile and beyond. Give us a little star and try out your first project after finishing the video today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Let's start by setting up our new project. We're using modules like all good go programs do. Next we're going to write some code. That's the first application written. What do we do next? Well, we want to run it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A markdown editor has an adaptive grid that has an entry for the input and a rich text widget for the rendering. We can rotate the device and have that adaptive grid change the orientation. The same code can be used to build a mobile application instead.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Go has unit test support baked right in. We'll edit some code and then we'll just run the test runner and see the output. The test runner is able to execute a fine application in memory without requiring those input and output devices. So they run really fast as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a really helpful command line tool also called fine. It can help us with our local packaging of a graphical app. We also have the ability to cross compile to other systems. We have a release sub command which is aiming to help you get your applications up to marketplaces.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                App toolkit includes graphical capabilities. Uses OpenGL and various hardware acceleration capabilities to make sure it's always super fast. As you might expect from a widget toolkit, there's lots of widgets available. Allows you to get all sorts of different kinds of data input into your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Working with files in a platform agnostic way is a little more complex. You can open a file with the dialogue package we'll call show file open. In fact, you can use data binding as well. This means that you can have your data separate from your user interface.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
