                Tejas Kumar: Today we're going to talk about react server components. We'll explore the architecture of react, including server components and how react was ten years ago, how it is today and how it might be tomorrow. This is going to be a really fun session and I'm really excited about it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The thing about react is it's multiple things. It is a library, but above and beyond library, it's an architecture as well. Over time the tooling has matured so much that we forget it even exists today. But react server components introduces a whole new wave of tooling.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                React server components is multiple things. It's a way of rendering and orchestrating applications and servers. That includes the server at every level of the virtual DoM. Tremendous benefits for data fetching performance and user experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A dog site is just a client app. We need to benefit from a little bit of server rendering. Let's start by adding a server. And then we'll add server components to the server. Next video will be something we did in the last video on Nextjs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We can use server components to turn our components into async components. How do we convert promises and other things into react elements that we can then send over the wire, aka server components?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need to account for both cases where type is a string and wheretype is a function. Anything that can consume the server component's output. Can take this big JSX tree that we've made and turn it into HTML. Let's try.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need react on the client side. How do we do that? Well, we already have this RSC output, the server component output that the server side understands. But symbols don't go over the network when they're serialized. We need to somehow swap out the symbol for something the client can understand.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So we have server components and we have them working on the client side. On the server side, we implemented an IRC server to turn them into this is how server components work. It takes a react JSX tree, turns it into an object, serializes it, sends it over the network, and then react.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We looked at the interplay between react server components, client side rendering, and server side rendering. Are server components better than client components? Absolutely not. Client components have their place, server components have its place, and it's really on us to weave them together.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to fetch data as early as possible, before any state is set. The earlier you fetch data, the better your chances are of adopting server components. Number two is you'd want to reconsider your interaction boundaries. I think these three tools will help you really adopt server Components.
