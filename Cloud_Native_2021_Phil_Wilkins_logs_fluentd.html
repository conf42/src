    <meta property="og:description" content="Understanding what is happening with a distributed solution can be challenging. Whilst the solution space for monitoring and application log management is mature, there is a tendency for organizations to end up with multiple tools which overlap in this space to meet different team needs – result multiple agents/probes on every server. Many of these tools work by bulk central analysis rather than enabling events of interest to be spotted as they’re logged.  Fluentd presents us with a means to simplify the monitoring landscape, address challenges of hyper-distribution occurring with microservice solutions, allowing different tools needing log data to help in their different way. Without imposing a specific analysis tool on relevant teams.  In this session, we’ll explore the challenges of modern log management.  We’ll look at how Fluentd works and what it can bring to making both development and ops activities easier.  To do this we’ll explore and demos some examples of Fluentd and how it makes life easier & more efficient."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Understanding what is happening with a distributed solution can be challenging. Whilst the solution space for monitoring and application log management is mature, there is a tendency for organizations to end up with multiple tools which overlap in this space to meet different team needs – result multiple agents/probes on every server. Many of these tools work by bulk central analysis rather than enabling events of interest to be spotted as they’re logged.</p>
<p>Fluentd presents us with a means to simplify the monitoring landscape, address challenges of hyper-distribution occurring with microservice solutions, allowing different tools needing log data to help in their different way. Without imposing a specific analysis tool on relevant teams.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll explore the challenges of modern log management.  We’ll look at how Fluentd works and what it can bring to making both development and ops activities easier.  To do this we’ll explore and demos some examples of Fluentd and how it makes life easier &amp; more efficient.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Phil Wilkins talks about Fluentd and how we can use it to make our logs so much more productive. He works for Capgemini in the UK and is in the process of finalizing a book called logging in action. If you're thinking about jumping a ship, then we are looking for good people.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What we look at logging and think about does actually vary quite a bit. From an infrastructure perspective, you're more likely to be worrying about things like the CPU and your memory resources. As you move into virtualization and containerization you're into a bit more of the logs. Capacity monitoring is still something to be considered.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of our key issues is looking for unexpected errors or warnings of an error scenario occurring. We can use the logs to warn us or give us indications that a problem is going to occur. Whatever we do with logging, we actually are monitoring. It's all got to support the business.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                These diagram is trying to help us understand or visualize the way monitoring has evolved. Years ago we used to be on single applications, single threads, single machine applications. Now each part of your application is completely transient. A real challenge there to deal with.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fluentd is a highly pluggable framework. Everything is pretty much seen as a plugin within the fluentd ecosystem. It can talk to many, many different sources. It is largely platform agnostic. You can build your own custom elements.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An open source utility helps to simulate application logging. It means that we can configure and test our fluent d pipelines without needing to run these real life systems. We could equally also route these events to an analytics engine for looking for anomalous behaviors.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Graff: In the real world we've got to deal with things like scaling. We want to bring logs together from logs of different sources to be able to analyze it properly end to end. There is a modern piece of thinking around what's known as open tracing. This could address some of our operational monitoring challenges.

              </li>
