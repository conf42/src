    <meta property="og:description" content="Maintaining your whole infrastructure using Terraform and reusable modules makes most of our lives easier, but when those less familiar with "DevOps" want to create or update resources, you usually either have to train and enable them to use Terraform, or handle the request yourself.  However what if you could offload the execution of those changes to a centralised tool and just review both the code and output being submitted for review? Atlantis, Terraform Cloud or env0 can act as a PR-based feedback loop for a hosted Terraform executor to make self-service a little bit easier."/>

<p>Maintaining your whole infrastructure using Terraform and reusable modules makes most of our lives easier, but when those less familiar with &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; want to create or update resources, you usually either have to train and enable them to use Terraform, or handle the request yourself.</p>
<p>However what if you could offload the execution of those changes to a centralised tool and just review both the code and output being submitted for review? Atlantis, Terraform Cloud or env0 can act as a PR-based feedback loop for a hosted Terraform executor to make self-service a little bit easier.</p>

                Andrew Kirkpatrick talks about self service pr based automated terraform. Can offload the execution of those changes to a centralized tool and just review both the code and output being submitted for review. Atlantis or m zero can act as a pr based feedback loop for a hosted terraforming executor to make self service easier.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Remote state is key to working with multiple engineers. How does that hook into self service infrastructure? Can you collaborate using pool based workflows for some projects, but continue to use a local workflow for others. How do these requests typically come in?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Atlantis has a concept of project locking, and this is separate from terraform state locking. Atlantis has a couple comment commands which you essentially comment on the pr, and it will trigger Atlantis plan and Atlantis apply. How does this relate to pull request workflows?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In cloud solutions like terraform cloud and n zero with Atlantis, you're going to have to figure but how to inject them. You can either fetch these from vault, given the correct integration, or say you could use Kubernetes external secrets. But otherwise it runs pretty much as you run it on the desktop.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A PR based workflow allows people to dip in and out of making infrastructure contributions. It also adds a proper peer review process before execution, which is nice. Some of the disadvantages though is that feedback cycle can be slow.

              </li>
