                Cox Communications Alexa customer services. In the background we use the Amazon Alexa NLP bot to process the customer through custom security checks. And if the customer wants to speak to an agent, we seamlessly transfer this customer to an agents.

              <li>
                Alexa app user or customer can come in via phone call or customer chat. Using an AI service in the background, Amazon Kendra is able to provide that information to agents. Your monthly phone bill will cover the cost of your plan and additional services.

                Customer service is a key to a success of any business. Customer needs to receive the right support at the right time. A happy customer is more likely to recommend your business to the others. Amazon Eptune helps you build that relationship mapping between the right customer to right agent.

                What do you see yourself using this for? Is this a personal use or is this for a business use case? I normally work from home and I've got two kids who are normally on their tabs watching YouTube. What we did here, we looked at how the customer agent was presented with information. It converted that inquiry into a sales.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An unhappy customer who is looking to leave the service. We have an offer available for you for a 30% discount for can entire year. I'm going to escalate this to our technical team and we will have somebody from the technical team reach out to you straight after this call.

              <li>
                We build a three dimensional relationship with the customer to see customer to sentiment, customer to product and customer to spend. And then we then pair up the agent to the customer call to be able to better serve that customer. AWS far AWS converting the inquiries to sales goes at the same time.
