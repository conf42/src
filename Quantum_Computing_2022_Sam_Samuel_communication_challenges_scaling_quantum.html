    <meta property="og:description" content="To scale quantum computers, the communication between them is key. The benefits of quantum computation are realized when that computation occurs in a distributed manner - this requires a quantum network to join those computational elements together, placing the prospect of quantum communication as a critical piece of the puzzle. However long-distance quantum communication is raising a number of questions that are not yet answered.   There are different modes of operations that a quantum network could have, each of them requiring quantum repeaters to guarantee end-to-end communication. All these modes come with their challenges in terms of communication rate, quantum memory management or cost of the network. This leads to additional challenges to address such as the reliability of information exchange and the integrity of end-to-end transport, as well as considerations around the engineering approach to quantum networking.  In this session, we will explore the role of quantum communication in getting quantum computers to scale meaningfully, the related challenges the industry needs to overcome and how Cisco is approaching these issues through close collaboration with selected academic partners.

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>To scale quantum computers, the communication between them is key. The benefits of quantum computation are realized when that computation occurs in a distributed manner - this requires a quantum network to join those computational elements together, placing the prospect of quantum communication as a critical piece of the puzzle. However long-distance quantum communication is raising a number of questions that are not yet answered. </p>
<p>There are different modes of operations that a quantum network could have, each of them requiring quantum repeaters to guarantee end-to-end communication. All these modes come with their challenges in terms of communication rate, quantum memory management or cost of the network. This leads to additional challenges to address such as the reliability of information exchange and the integrity of end-to-end transport, as well as considerations around the engineering approach to quantum networking.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore the role of quantum communication in getting quantum computers to scale meaningfully, the related challenges the industry needs to overcome and how Cisco is approaching these issues through close collaboration with selected academic partners. </p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Sam Samuel from Cisco Systems will give a talk on quantum communication challenges in scaling quantum computers. It'll go from basic quantum computing and how we can apply it in a variety of ways. And we eventually look at the problems that if we choose to go that direction, we will face.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's an increasing amount of investment going into quantum computing. The total investment is over a billion dollars now. It includes quantum computing, quantum software and also quantum communication and quantum Internet type things. This talk will look at that particular area and more.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Quantum computing is very different from classical computing. A qubit has the superposition of zero and one. The other thing that quantum computing uses an awful lot is entanglement. Quantum computing works off quantum circuits that are probabilistic in nature.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nevin's law is different from Moore's law in the sense that it's a double exponential rise in potency. As the potency of quantum computers increases, the likelihood of a quantum computer being able to break ciphering of current networking starts to go up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to make teleportation work, we really need to extend how we do these teleportation, and we do that by successively swapping entanglement on a communication link. In order for us to increase distance, to increase the distance over which we're able to teleport, we have to combine successive segments together with quantum regenerators.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order for us to do communications, we have to have qubits that have high fidelity and high purity. We also want techniques available to us that allow us to compensate for loss and decoherence. Network synchronization is also another problem. But the community, the academic community, and also the startup community are starting to address these problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How can I universally interpret programs for classical quantum communication? How can quantum data centers be virtualized in terms of resource and the management of those resources? And how can I find a cost effective way extending the rate and range of a which quantum communication can take place?
              </li>
