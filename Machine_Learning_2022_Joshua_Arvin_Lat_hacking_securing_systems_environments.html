    <meta property="og:description" content="Designing and building machine learning systems require a lot of skill, time, and experience. Data scientists, developers, and ML engineers work together in building ML systems and pipelines that automate different stages of the machine learning process. Once the ML systems have been set up, these systems need to be secured properly to prevent these systems from being hacked and compromised.  Some attacks have been customized to take advantage of vulnerabilities present in certain libraries. Other attacks may take advantage of vulnerabilities present in the custom code of ML engineers as well. There are different ways to attack machine learning systems and most data science teams are not equipped with the skills required to secure the systems they built. In this talk, we will discuss in detail the **cybersecurity attack chain** and how this affects a company's strategy when setting up different layers of security. We will discuss the different ways ML systems can be attacked and compromised and along the way, we will share the relevant strategies to mitigate these attacks."/>

<p>Designing and building machine learning systems require a lot of skill, time, and experience. Data scientists, developers, and ML engineers work together in building ML systems and pipelines that automate different stages of the machine learning process. Once the ML systems have been set up, these systems need to be secured properly to prevent these systems from being hacked and compromised.</p>
<p>Some attacks have been customized to take advantage of vulnerabilities present in certain libraries. Other attacks may take advantage of vulnerabilities present in the custom code of ML engineers as well. There are different ways to attack machine learning systems and most data science teams are not equipped with the skills required to secure the systems they built. In this talk, we will discuss in detail the <strong>cybersecurity attack chain</strong> and how this affects a company&rsquo;s strategy when setting up different layers of security. We will discuss the different ways ML systems can be attacked and compromised and along the way, we will share the relevant strategies to mitigate these attacks.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we will talk about machine learning and security. The title of my talk is hacking and securing machine learning environments and systems. I am the author of the book Machine Learning with Amazon Sagemaker cookbook. If you're interested in doing some hands on work on performing machine learning experiments in the AWS cloud, this may be the book for you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to build models, you would of course, need data. The entire process involves both machine learning and engineering. A lot of machine learning practitioners make use of specific frameworks and platforms and services in order to automate certain parts of the work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to know if your system is secure, you have CTO test it. These is very similar to testing load testing. A lot of companies often deprioritize security. Because if your data gets hacked, if your systems get stolen, your company might close.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a public subnet, and then there's a private subnet. Anyone can access that, including the attackers. So what you need to do is to add multiple layers of security. You need to prioritize what's highlighted and tagged as high risk.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you're not able to manage these things properly, hackers may be able to take advantage of that and use it to compromise your system. Hackers can do this by adding some payload, which, let's say, opens a port. Be very careful because usually the cloud environments have something called roles, roles and security entities.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you're running training jobs in the cloud, you may use a machine learning service which converts input into output. These input parameters are also the areas where your hacker might insert a payload or a malicious script. The different types of attacks would also differ depending on where you deploy your model.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An inference endpoint is simply maybe a web API where a model is hosted. Would the same set of concepts be usable when it comes to machine learning pipelines? Yes, especially if your pipelines involves different resources running the jobs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first practical way to secure a machine learning environment or system is CTO enable network isolation. Make sure that your CI CD pipelines, if it exists, would have this manual approval step. It's better if you can automate vulnerability management.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next, let's talk about infrastructure as code. Instead of us trying to deploy things manually, one resource at a time, we can simply convert our resources into code. This is something that you can use to manage the security resources and IAM configuration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first bucket is the infrastructure cost, the additional infrastructure cost. The second bucket would be, of course, the manpower required to work on these types of security requirements. Always plan ahead, because once you're able to identify what you need, it is usually a long term contract.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So there. We're able to start with discussing how to attack different scenarios. Towards the second half, we were able to talk about the different security measures. If we're not able to secure our systems properly, hackers and attackers would be able to steal our data. Thank you again for watching my talk and hope you learned something new.
