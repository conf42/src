My name is Miko Pawlikowski, I\u0027ll be guide and today with me, I\u0027ve got Swapneelkumar Deshpande, author of \"Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps solutions AZ-400 Exam Guide\", Second Edition. Hello Swapneel, how are you today?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:09  ", "timestamp_s": 9}, {"body": "Hey, Miko, I\u0027m very good. Thank you. And thank you for having me here", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "0:29  ", "timestamp_s": 29}, {"body": "Did I get the title, right? It\u0027s a long title \"AZ-400 Exam Guide\".", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:34  ", "timestamp_s": 34}, {"body": "It\u0027s mouthful, yeah.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "0:39  ", "timestamp_s": 39}, {"body": "But before we jump into that, as with every guest we have, we start you off with a difficult question. And yours is, if you could go faster than the speed of light, where would you go?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:41  ", "timestamp_s": 41}, {"body": "I would certainly try to go out of our Milky Way galaxy, and would like to see you know, the different galaxies. If I could have that, you know, superpower to go faster than the light and roam across the galaxies. Intra-galaxy traveller.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "0:52  ", "timestamp_s": 52}, {"body": "Well, I imagine your Instagram feed would be amazing when you come back. So we don\u0027t have authors every single time we have an episode. So let\u0027s jump in straight to your book. First of all, would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself and why you ended up writing a book with such a serious title?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:07  ", "timestamp_s": 67}, {"body": "Okay, the title is not that serious, alright? About me, I have been in the industry for now almost two decades, right? Been working on Microsoft platform since I think from long time back. So have a rich experience across the development, executing the large scale enterprise projects. Coming to when we deliver the projects, the biggest challenge has been, okay, how to deliver the quality? When it comes to the quality people want to be proud of what they delivered. But how do we ensure that everyone is capable, or everyone is empowered to deliver that quality code out to the production? So that\u0027s where the DevOps, which is like a collaboration between the multiple teams comes into picture. It is out there, people know about the DevOps in certain contexts, but there are tools how to use those tools, what are the different products are there in the market, which are going to be helpful to do this DevOps effectively. There was a need, which I saw that AZ-400, is I\u0027ll talk about the AZ-400 in a while, but the AZ-400 exam is a comprehensive on the DevOps. So I thought this is a good opportunity, and leverage my previous experience on to the DevOps and author this book.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "1:31  ", "timestamp_s": 91}, {"body": "I see. So you saw the need, and one day you woke up and you decide that, it\u0027s time, I\u0027m gonna write a book about it.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "2:51  ", "timestamp_s": 171}, {"body": "When I interacted with the forums and interacted with the groups, we realize that okay, each and every project, you take in the data, machine learning AI, your normal web applications, mobile applications, different technology stacks. But what is a common there is your DevOps cycle, the tools which are there, so which is essential for all of the folks to know about it. And there was opportunity as well. It was a long-given thought it was like, hey, you know, using the groups, using the YouTube, or some of the other groups, other meetup groups and everywhere, but yeah, this was the one of the better opportunity to author the book and share the experience and the knowledge.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "2:58  ", "timestamp_s": 178}, {"body": "Got it. And you\u0027re at the second edition now, right? So what was the first edition? ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "3:39  ", "timestamp_s": 219}, {"body": "It was the same, the book version, the name was the same. It was, I think, three, four years back. And the people who wrote it is Maik van der Gaag and Henry Been, and they were quite happy that the topics, the subject is still in demand. And we are working on to the version two, it was the same topic on this one.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "3:44  ", "timestamp_s": 224}, {"body": "Okay, so maybe let\u0027s try to demystify now the AZ-400 Exam. What is that?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "4:04  ", "timestamp_s": 244}, {"body": "Alright, so for the Microsoft has different different exams. And for Azure-related, they came up with the prefix as AZ, and the 400 is the number given for the DevOps-related exams. So when we talk about the DevOps solution, AZ-400. It covers what is a DevOps? Why do you need a DevOps? What is SRE? What are the different tools for your dependency management, for your security? Like say for security, Azure has his own Azure security, Azure defender. Then we have the for monitoring purposes Azure monitor, Azure application insights, log analytics. If we go a little bit forward, then we have the Kubernetes, you have the Kubernetes cluster. Then we have Azure app services, all other services out there, which are going to, you have continuous integration, continuous delivery. In fact, now we have a GitHub as well. And with the GitHub, there is a GitHub actions as well. But Azure 400 covers, when we go through this exam, you will be the confident the person will be confident enough that yes, if there is assignment is there, they can deliver, they can work on those assignments. Or the person is a little bit aware of the diverse activities like using the TerraForm scripts, or templates, like a little bit work on the Kubernetes side as well. It will cover your level 200. So there are different different levels like level 100, level 200, level 300. So this will cover up until the level 200. And you go a little bit deeper onto each of the chapters, each of the exercises, then you will be the expert into the DevOps site. So the AZ-400 exam, which is the one-step solution to understand various aspects of the DevOps.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "4:11  ", "timestamp_s": 251}, {"body": "And how much of that is actually Microsoft-specific? Because what you\u0027re describing sounds fairly broad. How much of that is actually Azure or Microsoft specific versus, you know, applicable anywhere?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "5:55  ", "timestamp_s": 355}, {"body": "So the concepts are pretty generic, alright. When we say, hey, I want a continuous integration, there are different different tools, like multiple tools in the market. GitLab is there, Jenkins there, multiple things are there. If we go for dependency management for NPM, it\u0027s a different thing for Java, there is a different thing than for Microsoft. For dotnet, there is a nougat. So there different available things in the market. But as a concept wise, when we talk about, okay, how do I deliver? How do I make it more effective formatting? Then the continuous integration is there, continuous delivery is there. How do you monitor your applications, when you deploy to your mobile to your website, or when we go for large scale application? When we say about the large scale, like when running on, you know, 1000s of your app services are running the same code. Each is running in a different regions, then how do we monitor it effectively, that\u0027s where these tools which are coming from the Azure will come hand it to us. And this exam focuses on those concepts and the tools which are developed by the Microsoft.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "6:10  ", "timestamp_s": 370}, {"body": "So basically, you\u0027ve got everything that you\u0027re going to need. If you\u0027re preparing for one of those exams, at the same time, you\u0027re going to learn a whole bunch of things that are applicable. I guess, regardless of the actual technology stack that you use. Tell me, which part did you find people were the most excited about? Because you\u0027re obviously touching a broad spectrum of things, when I read through the table of contents, you start with source control, through continuous integration, build, all the way to containers, and stuff like that. I\u0027m wondering, is there any particular one that people find the most exciting? How many questions do you get about the different parts of the book? ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "7:11  ", "timestamp_s": 431}, {"body": "I mean, the feedback which I have is, if the person is new, definitely they find the application insights, so how to instrument your applications, they find it very interesting. The reason is when we go to the cloud hey, you cannot just debug your applications, because it\u0027s a different thought process, to instrument your mobile applications to instrument your web applications running large scale in the cloud, and then monitor those applications using the Application Insights, writing those queries and see that okay, my application has, okay, these many different requests, these are my dependencies, this is my latency. When the person gets that visibility, people like that, and when they find it, okay, you know, when I came to know about this tool, this is helping me a lot. And the second part is, when we talk about the SRE, Site Reliability Engineering, that\u0027s something the overall ecosystem is still catching up on those things. Okay, how to install, how to implement the SRE or how to get to know about the SRE. Those are the two major things which I\u0027ve seen people liking those about. People when they read about it, okay, this is something which has been very helpful for us, but there are different chapters as well there, which is about the Kubernetes cluster. There is a different sets of groups. If somebody is a developer, they will talk about the dependency management, the instrumenting your applications. And if there is a testing person, or who is the project manager, he will talk more about the like, okay, I like the DevOps part. It\u0027s a different sets of chapters are there which are and all of these things are essential. We cannot just choose one, it goes as per your role, your role you\u0027re playing to the project.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "7:56  ", "timestamp_s": 476}, {"body": "Okay, so tell me what\u0027s going to come in the third edition. What editions are you planning on making when you refresh the book the next time?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "9:37  ", "timestamp_s": 577}, {"body": "That has not been, we just settled down, alright? We just finished a couple of months back to finishing the second edition. I\u0027ve been working with the Packt as a first time author for this book. The support from Packt was very nice considering the timeline and considering the review process, they have a very thorough review process across the contents, there are multiple review processes there. Possibly as a next one, it could be focusing on a specific chapter as a security or specific onto the Kubernetes cluster. This is a broad concept. Now we have to deep dive and double click on to each of the section. That\u0027s where we will jump into. But there are different different exams as well there. Like, if we go for security, AZ-204 exam is there. But that covers only the security, like how to do a deep dive into the security, let\u0027s say Azure Defender. Azure Defender has multiple features. Like when you upload a file to the blob, it automatically scans for is that like a malware? Or is there a problem with that file? Not many people know about it. So when we deep dive into those parts, but nothing is planned at this minute, but let us see how things go after this.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "9:46  ", "timestamp_s": 586}, {"body": "And you mentioned that the packed team offered good support and review. But I wass curious how your overall experience as a first time author was. Did you have to classic, \u0027Oh, this is great\u0027, \u0027Oh, no, I hate this\u0027, \u0027Oh, I\u0027m glad it\u0027s done\u0027, kind of curve? Or was it all easy and nice and relaxed for you?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "11:01  ", "timestamp_s": 661}, {"body": "Oh no. I mean, when I started I was not excited. Let us get it going. I have the weekend off, these days holidays. So I could spend some time. I was like, okay, not a difficult thing. I know everything about it. But when we sit down and try to articulate into the words, try to put it concisely into the chapters. That\u0027s where like, after first chapter, I was like, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do this again\u0027. Because the experience, the revision was there, multiple revisions coming around. The experience was like, it was worthwhile. I mean, it was a good learning curve for me as well. The support system, there was a support system available to me with from the Packt, as well as my quarters. So initially, it was very bumpy ride. I mean, look, no, no was I will, I don\u0027t want to do it anymore no. But when I gradually from first to second to third, then I got the gist of it like, hey, how do we put it across? I think I will definitely do it one more time.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "11:25  ", "timestamp_s": 685}, {"body": "One more time. How long did it take you?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "12:24  ", "timestamp_s": 744}, {"body": "Initially, the book was planned for six months, six to seven months. But due to the some of the changes into the topics and the multiple revisions, as well as the availability of the reviewers, it got a little bit delayed, and it took nine months overall to the final revision and the publication.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "12:29  ", "timestamp_s": 749}, {"body": "So almost on time, that doesn\u0027t sound too delayed.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "12:46  ", "timestamp_s": 766}, {"body": "Nine months like you want to get it done. Because if you remember your first chapter you wrote, wrote like six months back, what I was thinking, like, you know, when you write your code, you write something when you implement it. What was I thinking when I implement this logic? Bring back that thought process, go into that kind of zone, where have you aligned with your previous thought process. And don\u0027t go on rewriting the complete chapter. That\u0027s where we are to work on it more.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "12:51  ", "timestamp_s": 771}, {"body": "Definitely. Okay, so one more question for you. Looking into the future. And you know, given your experience with this DevOps space, what kind of developments do you expect to become more and more significant? Are there any trends that you\u0027ve been seeing become more important? Let\u0027s say if we talk about 2023, what would you expect to become the next big thing?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "13:21  ", "timestamp_s": 801}, {"body": "I see the more interest around the Kubernetes definitely, the people want to go serverless. They do not want on the servers. So more kind of like a platform as a service, platform on the serverless functions. If I talk about, you know, the deployment style, this is the way I want to deploy my applications. So I worry less about it, about the scaling part about managing those parts. That\u0027s where the most companies will try to adopt it, they can, once you go to the Kubernetes, it becomes a neutral to the provider like the things can move from one cloud to another cloud, or from that cloud to your own data center. Or it may be one of the machine which is running under your desk. So I mean, as well as that machine supports your infrastructure requirements. But it\u0027s very easy when you have Docker images. When you go for that kind of deployment, that adoption to the Docker, I see as more becoming more adoptable and people will be running less across to the without Docker applications.", "speaker": "Swapneelkumar Deshpande", "timestamp": "13:51  ", "timestamp_s": 831}, {"body": "Not that long ago, were promised we would have flying cars by now.

            </p>
            <p id="body-67" class="transcript-paragraph">Well, I imagine your Instagram feed would be amazing when you come back. So we don't have authors every single time we have an episode. So let's jump in straight to your book. First of all, would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself and why you ended up writing a book with such a serious title?</p>

            

            <p id="91">
              <a href="#91" onclick="seek(91);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 1:31  </a>
              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-91" class="transcript-paragraph">Okay, the title is not that serious, alright? About me, I have been in the industry for now almost two decades, right? Been working on Microsoft platform since I think from long time back. So have a rich experience across the development, executing the large scale enterprise projects. Coming to when we deliver the projects, the biggest challenge has been, okay, how to deliver the quality? When it comes to the quality people want to be proud of what they delivered. But how do we ensure that everyone is capable, or everyone is empowered to deliver that quality code out to the production? So that's where the DevOps, which is like a collaboration between the multiple teams comes into picture. It is out there, people know about the DevOps in certain contexts, but there are tools how to use those tools, what are the different products are there in the market, which are going to be helpful to do this DevOps effectively. There was a need, which I saw that AZ-400, is I'll talk about the AZ-400 in a while, but the AZ-400 exam is a comprehensive on the DevOps. So I thought this is a good opportunity, and leverage my previous experience on to the DevOps and author this book.</p>

            

            <p id="171">
              <a href="#171" onclick="seek(171);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 2:51  </a>

            </p>
            <p id="body-171" class="transcript-paragraph">I see. So you saw the need, and one day you woke up and you decide that, it's time, I'm gonna write a book about it.</p>

            

            <p id="178">
              <a href="#178" onclick="seek(178);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 2:58  </a>

            </p>
            <p id="body-178" class="transcript-paragraph">When I interacted with the forums and interacted with the groups, we realize that okay, each and every project, you take in the data, machine learning AI, your normal web applications, mobile applications, different technology stacks. But what is a common there is your DevOps cycle, the tools which are there, so which is essential for all of the folks to know about it. And there was opportunity as well. It was a long-given thought it was like, hey, you know, using the groups, using the YouTube, or some of the other groups, other meetup groups and everywhere, but yeah, this was the one of the better opportunity to author the book and share the experience and the knowledge.</p>

            

            <p id="219">

            <p id="body-219" class="transcript-paragraph">Got it. And you're at the second edition now, right? So what was the first edition? </p>

            

            <p id="224">
              <a href="#224" onclick="seek(224);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 3:44  </a>

            </p>
            <p id="body-224" class="transcript-paragraph">It was the same, the book version, the name was the same. It was, I think, three, four years back. And the people who wrote it is Maik van der Gaag and Henry Been, and they were quite happy that the topics, the subject is still in demand. And we are working on to the version two, it was the same topic on this one.</p>

            

            <p id="244">

            </p>
            <p id="body-244" class="transcript-paragraph">Okay, so maybe let's try to demystify now the AZ-400 Exam. What is that?</p>

            

            <p id="251">
              <a href="#251" onclick="seek(251);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 4:11  </a>

            </p>
            <p id="body-251" class="transcript-paragraph">Alright, so for the Microsoft has different different exams. And for Azure-related, they came up with the prefix as AZ, and the 400 is the number given for the DevOps-related exams. So when we talk about the DevOps solution, AZ-400. It covers what is a DevOps? Why do you need a DevOps? What is SRE? What are the different tools for your dependency management, for your security? Like say for security, Azure has his own Azure security, Azure defender. Then we have the for monitoring purposes Azure monitor, Azure application insights, log analytics. If we go a little bit forward, then we have the Kubernetes, you have the Kubernetes cluster. Then we have Azure app services, all other services out there, which are going to, you have continuous integration, continuous delivery. In fact, now we have a GitHub as well. And with the GitHub, there is a GitHub actions as well. But Azure 400 covers, when we go through this exam, you will be the confident the person will be confident enough that yes, if there is assignment is there, they can deliver, they can work on those assignments. Or the person is a little bit aware of the diverse activities like using the TerraForm scripts, or templates, like a little bit work on the Kubernetes side as well. It will cover your level 200. So there are different different levels like level 100, level 200, level 300. So this will cover up until the level 200. And you go a little bit deeper onto each of the chapters, each of the exercises, then you will be the expert into the DevOps site. So the AZ-400 exam, which is the one-step solution to understand various aspects of the DevOps.</p>

            

            <p id="355">
              <a href="#355" onclick="seek(355);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 5:55  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-355" class="transcript-paragraph">And how much of that is actually Microsoft-specific? Because what you're describing sounds fairly broad. How much of that is actually Azure or Microsoft specific versus, you know, applicable anywhere?</p>

            

            <p id="370">
              <a href="#370" onclick="seek(370);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 6:10  </a>
              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-370" class="transcript-paragraph">So the concepts are pretty generic, alright. When we say, hey, I want a continuous integration, there are different different tools, like multiple tools in the market. GitLab is there, Jenkins there, multiple things are there. If we go for dependency management for NPM, it's a different thing for Java, there is a different thing than for Microsoft. For dotnet, there is a nougat. So there different available things in the market. But as a concept wise, when we talk about, okay, how do I deliver? How do I make it more effective formatting? Then the continuous integration is there, continuous delivery is there. How do you monitor your applications, when you deploy to your mobile to your website, or when we go for large scale application? When we say about the large scale, like when running on, you know, 1000s of your app services are running the same code. Each is running in a different regions, then how do we monitor it effectively, that's where these tools which are coming from the Azure will come hand it to us. And this exam focuses on those concepts and the tools which are developed by the Microsoft.</p>

            

            <p id="431">
              <a href="#431" onclick="seek(431);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 7:11  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-431" class="transcript-paragraph">So basically, you've got everything that you're going to need. If you're preparing for one of those exams, at the same time, you're going to learn a whole bunch of things that are applicable. I guess, regardless of the actual technology stack that you use. Tell me, which part did you find people were the most excited about? Because you're obviously touching a broad spectrum of things, when I read through the table of contents, you start with source control, through continuous integration, build, all the way to containers, and stuff like that. I'm wondering, is there any particular one that people find the most exciting? How many questions do you get about the different parts of the book? </p>

            

            <p id="476">
              <a href="#476" onclick="seek(476);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 7:56  </a>
              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-476" class="transcript-paragraph">I mean, the feedback which I have is, if the person is new, definitely they find the application insights, so how to instrument your applications, they find it very interesting. The reason is when we go to the cloud hey, you cannot just debug your applications, because it's a different thought process, to instrument your mobile applications to instrument your web applications running large scale in the cloud, and then monitor those applications using the Application Insights, writing those queries and see that okay, my application has, okay, these many different requests, these are my dependencies, this is my latency. When the person gets that visibility, people like that, and when they find it, okay, you know, when I came to know about this tool, this is helping me a lot. And the second part is, when we talk about the SRE, Site Reliability Engineering, that's something the overall ecosystem is still catching up on those things. Okay, how to install, how to implement the SRE or how to get to know about the SRE. Those are the two major things which I've seen people liking those about. People when they read about it, okay, this is something which has been very helpful for us, but there are different chapters as well there, which is about the Kubernetes cluster. There is a different sets of groups. If somebody is a developer, they will talk about the dependency management, the instrumenting your applications. And if there is a testing person, or who is the project manager, he will talk more about the like, okay, I like the DevOps part. It's a different sets of chapters are there which are and all of these things are essential. We cannot just choose one, it goes as per your role, your role you're playing to the project.</p>

The support from Packt was very nice considering the timeline and considering the review process, they have a very thorough review process across the contents, there are multiple review processes there. Possibly as a next one, it could be focusing on a specific chapter as a security or specific onto the Kubernetes cluster. This is a broad concept. Now we have to deep dive and double click on to each of the section. That's where we will jump into. But there are different different exams as well there. Like, if we go for security, AZ-204 exam is there. But that covers only the security, like how to do a deep dive into the security, let's say Azure Defender. Azure Defender has multiple features. Like when you upload a file to the blob, it automatically scans for is that like a malware? Or is there a problem with that file? Not many people know about it. So when we deep dive into those parts, but nothing is planned at this minute, but let us see how things go after this.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-661" class="transcript-paragraph">And you mentioned that the packed team offered good support and review. But I wass curious how your overall experience as a first time author was. Did you have to classic, 'Oh, this is great', 'Oh, no, I hate this', 'Oh, I'm glad it's done', kind of curve? Or was it all easy and nice and relaxed for you?</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-685" class="transcript-paragraph">Oh no. I mean, when I started I was not excited. Let us get it going. I have the weekend off, these days holidays. So I could spend some time. I was like, okay, not a difficult thing. I know everything about it. But when we sit down and try to articulate into the words, try to put it concisely into the chapters. That's where like, after first chapter, I was like, 'No, I don't want to do this again'. Because the experience, the revision was there, multiple revisions coming around. The experience was like, it was worthwhile. I mean, it was a good learning curve for me as well. The support system, there was a support system available to me with from the Packt, as well as my quarters. So initially, it was very bumpy ride. I mean, look, no, no was I will, I don't want to do it anymore no. But when I gradually from first to second to third, then I got the gist of it like, hey, how do we put it across? I think I will definitely do it one more time.</p>

            

            <p id="744">

              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-744" class="transcript-paragraph">One more time. How long did it take you?</p>

            

            <p id="749">

              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-749" class="transcript-paragraph">Initially, the book was planned for six months, six to seven months. But due to the some of the changes into the topics and the multiple revisions, as well as the availability of the reviewers, it got a little bit delayed, and it took nine months overall to the final revision and the publication.</p>

            

            <p id="766">

              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-766" class="transcript-paragraph">So almost on time, that doesn't sound too delayed.</p>

              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-771" class="transcript-paragraph">Nine months like you want to get it done. Because if you remember your first chapter you wrote, wrote like six months back, what I was thinking, like, you know, when you write your code, you write something when you implement it. What was I thinking when I implement this logic? Bring back that thought process, go into that kind of zone, where have you aligned with your previous thought process. And don't go on rewriting the complete chapter. That's where we are to work on it more.</p>

            

            <p id="801">
              <a href="#801" onclick="seek(801);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 13:21  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-801" class="transcript-paragraph">Definitely. Okay, so one more question for you. Looking into the future. And you know, given your experience with this DevOps space, what kind of developments do you expect to become more and more significant? Are there any trends that you've been seeing become more important? Let's say if we talk about 2023, what would you expect to become the next big thing?</p>

            

            <p id="831">
              <a href="#831" onclick="seek(831);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 13:51  </a>
              Swapneelkumar Deshpande
            </p>
            <p id="body-831" class="transcript-paragraph">I see the more interest around the Kubernetes definitely, the people want to go serverless. They do not want on the servers. So more kind of like a platform as a service, platform on the serverless functions. If I talk about, you know, the deployment style, this is the way I want to deploy my applications. So I worry less about it, about the scaling part about managing those parts. That's where the most companies will try to adopt it, they can, once you go to the Kubernetes, it becomes a neutral to the provider like the things can move from one cloud to another cloud, or from that cloud to your own data center. Or it may be one of the machine which is running under your desk. So I mean, as well as that machine supports your infrastructure requirements. But it's very easy when you have Docker images. When you go for that kind of deployment, that adoption to the Docker, I see as more becoming more adoptable and people will be running less across to the without Docker applications.</p>

            <p id="body-899" class="transcript-paragraph">Not that long ago, were promised we would have flying cars by now. But sounds like serverless is the second best thing and we're gonna have to make do with that.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-918" class="transcript-paragraph">There was this question, but if you asked me about the flying cars, right, is something like, Hey, okay, there is a flying car going above my head. I don't want to go to the anxious mode. Like, okay. I don't know when he's going to have the glitch and going to fall down. But fair enough. Yeah, it would be good to have the flying cars.</p>
