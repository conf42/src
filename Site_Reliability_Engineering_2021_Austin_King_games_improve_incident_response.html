    <meta property="og:description" content="Incident Response is a core competency for SRE teams, but how can teams practice and improve?  Inefficient incident response can be costly to a company. It causes lost revenue and destroys customer trust.  We will discuss mainstream games, a conceptual frameworks for creating team specific drills, and finally introduce an innovative research topic - outage simulation. An outage simulator gives SRE teams a tool for practicing incident response.  Core incident response skills are: severity triage, communication, delegation, and system familiarity. Drilling on these increases these skills, knowledge, efficiency, team cohesion and resilience.  SRE Managers and ICs will learn why games such as "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" are played by many SRE teams. They will learn in detail how to create their own fire-drills from existing runbook entries.  An overview of chaos testing and gamedays will be mentioned to provide the broader context. We will cover the pros and cons of each of these methods.  Lastly, we will present the concept of an incident response simulator as an open research topic. The hypothesis will be that an incident simulator is a good trade-off between non-domain specific games and full-blown Gamedays.  This is a talk illustrated with slides."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Incident Response is a core competency for SRE teams, but how can teams practice and improve?</p>
<p>Inefficient incident response can be costly to a company. It causes lost revenue and destroys customer trust.</p>
<p>We will discuss mainstream games, a conceptual frameworks for creating team specific drills, and finally introduce an innovative research topic - outage simulation. An outage simulator gives SRE teams a tool for practicing incident response.</p>
<p>Core incident response skills are: severity triage, communication, delegation, and system familiarity. Drilling on these increases these skills, knowledge, efficiency, team cohesion and resilience.</p>
<p>SRE Managers and ICs will learn why games such as &ldquo;Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes&rdquo; are played by many SRE teams. They will learn in detail how to create their own fire-drills from existing runbook entries.</p>
<p>An overview of chaos testing and gamedays will be mentioned to provide the broader context. We will cover the pros and cons of each of these methods.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will present the concept of an incident response simulator as an open research topic. The hypothesis will be that an incident simulator is a good trade-off between non-domain specific games and full-blown Gamedays.</p>
<p>This is a talk illustrated with slides.</p>

                Psychological safety, team cohesion and aspects of incident response are the human factors of resiliency. Curiosity and problem solving are very important to incident responders. Communication, delegation and coordination are especially important for an incident commander.

                Poor performance leads to longer times to recover our system. The faster, on average, we are at resolving an outage, these better. How can we grow our SRE culture, our DevOps culture, how can we improve it?

                Jackbox is a collection of party games. A great place to look for these is board game arena. Asymmetrical co op games are a great one for stressing communication. ICS keep talking and nobody explodes.

              <li>
                In terms of delegation and communication, in terms of role based co op games, a great one here is overcooked. The way overcooked works is there's different cooking stations in a kitchen, and you're trying to make food for customers under some time pressures. A leader needs to be assigned to anticipate resource bottlenecks.

              <li>
                Can we play games within our teams, in our particular team, and even across the or across the company to get better at the incident management, incident response skills? First up is tabletop exercises. Next up is fire drills.

              <li>
                The idea of a fire drill leads us naturally into chaos testing. Netflix is famous for chaos testing their systems in production. ICS game days are typically done in production, more big scary events. I would just encourage everybody, especially if you're shifting to remote first.
