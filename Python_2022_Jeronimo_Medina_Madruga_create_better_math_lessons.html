    <meta property="og:title" content="How to use Python to create better math lessons | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="This presentation is based on my master's thesis in the field of mathematics education, which is addressing the possibilities of using python for teaching mathematics. To get to this topic, it was necessary to research the current state of using Python and other languages in the classroom in Brazil and worldwide. This made it possible to understand many of the difficulties and advantages of working with programming languages as a tool to help teachers.   Therefore, the idea is to pass on these lessons so that other educators can try to implement different experiences in their classes."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>This presentation is based on my master&rsquo;s thesis in the field of mathematics education, which is addressing the possibilities of using python for teaching mathematics. To get to this topic, it was necessary to research the current state of using Python and other languages in the classroom in Brazil and worldwide. This made it possible to understand many of the difficulties and advantages of working with programming languages as a tool to help teachers. </p>
<p>Therefore, the idea is to pass on these lessons so that other educators can try to implement different experiences in their classes.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 Jeronimo Medina Madruga will talk about how to use Python to create better math lessons. This talk will be light hearted, it won't be very technical. If you want to go deeper in some of the topics you may contact me.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The beauty of mathematics lies first and foremost in its ability to act as a practical tool to make sense of our complex world. We need more than ever to have students that are really good with the technical side, with math, with technology. But we need to improve the quality of our education.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have to mix practical teachers and theory teaching together in order to achieve better results. A lot of math concepts are connected and scattered around the gaming world. We can also use music creation as a topic to learn math. But there are many hiccups when we see who already tried this change in education.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Python should not be seen only as a calculator. There are other tools to create music with Python. I'm still learning how to use Jytum, but the jytom environment has a good potential.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Python is not only about the language. The ecosystem around of it has so many solutions that might help you, your class, your teachers, your community, to create better lessons. Most of the time you don't really have to create something new. You have to only understand what is the right kind of package.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The snake game isn't only about the snake game, it's about math. We have to create digital assets and make these content around of it. Every game has a lot of math concepts behind it. If we teach today as we learned yesterday, we are robbing students of these tomorrow.
              </li>
