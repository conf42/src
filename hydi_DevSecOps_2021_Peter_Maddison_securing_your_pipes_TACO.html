    <meta property="og:description" content="In highly regulated environments, governing bodies of the organization can quickly get in the way of your delivery. What I present is a straw man for architecture, compliance, security and development to come to agreement on their minimum viable bureaucracy.  TACO stands for Traceability, Access, Compliance, and Operations and is a set of 20 controls I use as a guideline for helping organizations define automated governance for their software delivery pipelines. However, the primary purpose of TACO is to provide a common language for the organization to understand what ""good"" pipelines mean for them and how to get there.  This model allows for the creation of opinionated pipelines and helps create a common understanding across teams as to what is required in order to be secure. Taking a TACO approach can be considered a part of implementing a DevSecOps program and I’ve used this approach at multiple banks. Having this baseline helps build organizational confidence in the automation of software delivery.  During the talk, I’ll run through the different categories of controls, how they are implemented, what the purpose of them is, how to create robust feedback loops for controls."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>In highly regulated environments, governing bodies of the organization can quickly get in the way of your delivery. What I present is a straw man for architecture, compliance, security and development to come to agreement on their minimum viable bureaucracy.</p>
<p>TACO stands for Traceability, Access, Compliance, and Operations and is a set of 20 controls I use as a guideline for helping organizations define automated governance for their software delivery pipelines. However, the primary purpose of TACO is to provide a common language for the organization to understand what &ldquo;&rdquo;good&rdquo;&rdquo; pipelines mean for them and how to get there.</p>
<p>This model allows for the creation of opinionated pipelines and helps create a common understanding across teams as to what is required in order to be secure. Taking a TACO approach can be considered a part of implementing a DevSecOps program and I’ve used this approach at multiple banks. Having this baseline helps build organizational confidence in the automation of software delivery.</p>
<p>During the talk, I’ll run through the different categories of controls, how they are implemented, what the purpose of them is, how to create robust feedback loops for controls.</p>

              <li>
                This is all about automating governance. How do I properly manage changes to regulation, changes to security standards. Stay tuned and I hopefully we'll have some good advice and guidance for you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Peter Maddison is a coach, a consultant, and the founder of a consulting organization called Zodiac. His speciality is around DevOps strategy and around lean controls. He says efforts to adopt these tools fails from a lack of clarity. We need ways of being able to introduce change more rapidly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need to bring those practices into the entire system, into other parts of the system that also we need to consider around security, compliance and regulation. If we're not aligned in our vision and aligned in how we go about creating value for our customers, then we'll not actually accelerate the way that we deliver.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the big problems we see is that the parts of the organization that are responsible for ensuring the safety of the organizations are often not aligned to the delivery teams. We need to come up with better ways of being able to understand and apply these rules into our delivery teams in a much faster manner.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So let's start with the pipelines, because if we want to take a look at DevOps, this is a good place to start. There are lots of things that we can do at each stage in order to manage and secure the pipeline. It's not just for the auditors, it's also very powerful to help with the adoption of new practices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The elements of taco are traceability, like identifying what happens in the pipeline. This is critical both from an operational perspective and from a security perspective and a compliance perspective. This works very well with other compliance frameworks and allows us to create a straw man that we could then marry into the organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's only one question required on the survey, which is, hey, did you like this? And if you want to, you can leave your email there and it will send you a copy of the taco spreadsheet and some useful links. With that, I'll sign off and say thank you very much.
