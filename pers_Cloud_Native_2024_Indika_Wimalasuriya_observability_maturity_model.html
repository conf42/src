              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                I'll be walking you through how you can leverage AWS to build a comprehensive observability maturity model which will take your observability from reactive to autonomous. It's very important when you are implementing a maturity model to ensure that you are measuring business outcomes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud native is not the buzzword now. It's cutting over a lot of overheads, but it has its own complexities as well. The traditional monitoring will fall about when you are in cloud native. Without observability you will definitely fall apart and you will not achieve your end objectives.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's very important that you kind of have an observability maturity model. The maturity model is very important because that is we are not stuck. You can take it, do a little bit of customizations to suit your needs. From there you can start your observability journey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When building an AWS based observability, what are the key pillars? Logs are the most ancient type of observability element. Then comes the metrics. Tracing is probably the newest kid in the block. Be mindful of cost as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                First model is reactive, where it's about just doing the basics to ensure that you are kind of like getting alerts when the systems goes down. The next level is being proactive. And then predictive is the way to go where that will allow you to predict something. But does all systems need to be at the autonomous level?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Four levels of maturity: reactive, proactive, predictive and autonomous. Tracing usually in the keeping the lights on the reactive level. When it comes to predictive autonomous, it's about bringing in AI and ML. Achieving the observability objectives and cost is a very important factor.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In high level, what we need is real user monitoring. Next we'll try to implement APM or the application performance with distributed tracing. Ensure that you enable log anomaly detection. And then finally, obviously you will have to do your infrastructure monitoring.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's very important you clearly define your goals, how to measure your customer experience. The more you are going from reactive to autonomous, you should be able to achieve your service level objectives. Ensure that all your data observability telemetry data are centralized. And finally, so where the cloud native observability is heading.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And finally, my prediction for this year. Dynatrace, Datadoc, new relic are the top three. And we have Amazon Web services, also a leading contender and in the challengers category. There's a great line of speakers who are going to speak part of Cloud Native 2024.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
