    <meta property="og:description" content="How does one choose to architect a system that has a Microservice / REST API endpoints?  There are many solutions out there.  Some are better than others.  Should state be held in a server side component?  Generally we are told this is a bad practice, but is it?  It’s unclear and this confusion may lead to poor technology stack choices that are impossible or extremely hard to change later on as your system evolves in terms of demand and performance.  We learn from the experience of others.  Choosing who to follow is hard and this topic will help you the developer or technical decision maker to meet your company’s I.T. demands in the modern world.  We will explore into a tried and true, enterprise-grade, Java Open Source stack - Open Liberty in Kubernetes - which exercises and promises to fulfill the expectations of a modern server solution that epitomizes all the elements needed to build, run and deploy an efficient production system today.  We will examine and demonstrate the fundamentals of such a system that’s built with Open Liberty in Kubernetes: * Microservices/REST API –  Options to use when running your apps in the JVM * Concurrency – how to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and clustered distributed systems  * Stateful vs Stateless - while stateless apps are easier to implement, the bulk of the apps in production are stateful which involve a higher level of complexity and risk, especially when data would need to travel across multiple machine and network boundaries * Deployment – how about containerization and orchestration using Kubernetes?

<!-- Text -->
<p>How does one choose to architect a system that has a Microservice / REST API endpoints?  There are many solutions out there.  Some are better than others.  Should state be held in a server side component?  Generally we are told this is a bad practice, but is it?  It’s unclear and this confusion may lead to poor technology stack choices that are impossible or extremely hard to change later on as your system evolves in terms of demand and performance.</p>
<p>We learn from the experience of others.  Choosing who to follow is hard and this topic will help you the developer or technical decision maker to meet your company’s I.T. demands in the modern world.  We will explore into a tried and true, enterprise-grade, Java Open Source stack - Open Liberty in Kubernetes - which exercises and promises to fulfill the expectations of a modern server solution that epitomizes all the elements needed to build, run and deploy an efficient production system today.</p>
<p>We will examine and demonstrate the fundamentals of such a system that’s built with Open Liberty in Kubernetes:
* Microservices/REST API –  Options to use when running your apps in the JVM
* Concurrency – how to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and clustered distributed systems 
* Stateful vs Stateless - while stateless apps are easier to implement, the bulk of the apps in production are stateful which involve a higher level of complexity and risk, especially when data would need to travel across multiple machine and network boundaries
* Deployment – how about containerization and orchestration using Kubernetes?</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Mary Grygleski is a senior developer advocate at IBM. Her area also involves cloud native, cloud DevOps, enterprise distributed systems. Today's topic is about stateful microservices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What stateful versus stateless means. For me coming from a reactive background I see a lot of overlapping concepts. It's not like black and white, that's reactive and that's stateful. There are tons of information that have yet to be mined from this topic area.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Dory is a very forgetful fish. She doesn't remember anything. Nemo was full of know, really hilarious kind of moments. If you don't need to remember things, you actually can go ahead and do things. We just kind of laugh about things like that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Stateless computing is a communication protocol that does not retain any session information. It helps to scale the systems a lot easier. And of course too, if there's system crash, then the recoverable, it's very recoverable.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Too for cookie, right. You basically will give the server your session id and then the server would have to then look up the information. With a token based like JWT, then the JWT is allowed to keep more information. You can encapsulate also the session information in that token.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud native computing is really an extension to cloud computing. It addresses the true needs of an enterprise level distributed business application systems. The goal of cloud native is to have very agile systems. This pairs up really well with the reactive concept of being very responsive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Stateful microservices. How is that possible? So cloud native, right. You may also have heard of this twelve factor application. This kind of describe what a cloud native application should do. It's basically, it says any kind of cloud native apps, it needs to be able to start up fast.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In a cloud native environment, now we are really dealing with true distributed systems. How do we preserve state across session, across transaction and network boundaries? All of these things are not intrinsic to the microservices itself. But these are like techniques, mechanism that we can utilize.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With cloud native, why don't we then take advantage of the cloud native infrastructure? Infrastructure like kubernetes essentially too, there's concepts of stateful sets. Cloud native DaC two makes use of the container level persistence too for you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A very prominent pattern these days to use to think of is the saga pattern. There's also this thing called long running action, and this one is a form of also saga too. I kind of split them up into two, but they could easily be combined together.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Saga is really like we're helping transactions to span across multiple services. But we don't want to go back to the told ways of database two phase commit. Instead using a saga pattern is being advocated in a microservices environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One type is called choreography sagas. It leverage on an event driven kind of way of notifying. And then there's another kind of sagas, which is orchestration. These are two primary ways of how sagas deal with coordinating the different pieces of your system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                IBM working with open Liberty, now open Liberty has a very good integration and supports microprofile. LRA is long running action, and it's essentially leveraged on a compensator model. These examples are not like production level yet. All of these are new and running in a cloud native way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first one is a stateful open liberty application in Kubernetes. How do you use open Liberty's session cache to persist data. Next up is the stateful cube demo. And then saga if you want to read up more on that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can use Kubecontrol to apply your Kubernetes. Yaml. The Yaml file is set up for you already. One caveat is that if you have multiple kubernetes and you're using your control, as you may know, then you want to make sure your containerization is pointing to the correct one.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 IBM using, by the way, openj nine runtime for the JVM and 15 adopt OpenJDK 15. Now once it run, I just wanted to show up to the point in which you can bring up the, oh, I'm so sorry, what is going on?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Right. The default server is ready to run a smarter planet. In order to run it, you just run localhost 90 80 Openapiui. Then you can then play around with it. The application isn't very complicated. And then you can build really serious applications after that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open Liberty session persistence using JCash. Demo will illustrate to you to running this in a true Kubernetes environment. Feel free to contact me, follow me on my discord and talk to me about what you think of it too.

              </li>
