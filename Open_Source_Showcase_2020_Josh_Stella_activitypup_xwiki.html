    <meta property="og:description" content="Cloud security is a software engineering problem⁠ - not a traditional security problem. This talk will demonstrate an advanced cloud misconfiguration exploit to understand how to protect against such attacks using architecture best practices.  The cloud changed the way hackers operate: Rather than targeting an organization and then searching for vulnerabilities to exploit, they now use automation to scan the internet looking for cloud misconfigurations to exploit, and then use IAM like a network to move laterally, find data, and extract it. We’ve graduated from simple misconfiguration mistakes to techniques bad actors are using today to breach data out from under the most advanced cloud security teams⁠—often without detection."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Cloud security is a software engineering problem⁠ - not a traditional security problem. This talk will demonstrate an advanced cloud misconfiguration exploit to understand how to protect against such attacks using architecture best practices.</p>
<p>The cloud changed the way hackers operate: Rather than targeting an organization and then searching for vulnerabilities to exploit, they now use automation to scan the internet looking for cloud misconfigurations to exploit, and then use IAM like a network to move laterally, find data, and extract it. We’ve graduated from simple misconfiguration mistakes to techniques bad actors are using today to breach data out from under the most advanced cloud security teams⁠—often without detection.</p>

                Josh Stella is the CTO and co founder of Fug. Surface now is cloud misconfiguration. iam going to break into one of my own cloud accounts and steal data out of it. Then we're going to talk about some actionable steps to secure this as your customers to secure your cloud environments.

              <li>
                Cloud misconfiguration is having the cloud services in AWS or Azure or GCP configured in a way that bad guys can take advantage of. 92% are concerned they're vulnerable to a cloud breach. This is an increasing problem, and it is not going to go away.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud misconfiguration should be scaring all of us. It's really a new domain in security. Putting network monitors on your network endpoints will fail you in the cloud. Hackers are thinking about it a whole new way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Frogue: Cloud misconfiguration is very often overlooked. One of the reasons for this is the compliance frameworks that people rely upon. They're really good, but they're incomplete and they're losing the race with the bad guys. Nearly all successful attacks on cloud services are the result of customer mis configuration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most breaches are due to misconfiguration, not traditional ways that hackers would get in. Both are employing automation to discover and exploit misconfigured cloud assets within hours of their deployment. Therefore, your security strategy has to evolve. Infrastructure is now or should be in cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hackers need to be aware of everything in your cloud infrastructure. You need to deny the hacker knowledge of as much as you can. Every single step I take I'm going to explain in a way that you'll be able to understand.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As a bad guy doing discovery, IAM looking for the IAM security credentials. All I'm trying to do is list policies. If you think list permissions aren't scary and bad guys and hackers can't exploit them, you are very, very wrong.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The hack was done using a command called sync. It was mostly going to be exploiting iam to get to s three to steal from s three. Not a single bit of data was traversed any of your intrusion detection systems. Because what you have is evidence that this was taking place.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                CTo: Include cloud misconfiguration and pen testing. Don't use star in IAM ever. Get rid of unused cloud resources, especially EC two instances s three buckets. Use automation remediation again.

              </li>
