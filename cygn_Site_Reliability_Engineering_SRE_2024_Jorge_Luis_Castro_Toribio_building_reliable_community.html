                Jorge Castro: My talk is building more reliable products through SRE community of practices. Connecting people makes better continuous delivery. Please add me to your LinkedIn. It would be awesome if we can keep in touch after this session.

                In this talk we are going to share our experiences facing the business challenge to build more reliable products to meet customer needs at enterprise level. The idea is that a community help us to foster team collaboration, sharing knowledge and fix the skill gaps.

                Site reliability engineering is a framework to handle these operation structure. SRE focuses on running systems in production. Another key point about SRE is incident response processes. So this is a kind of summary about what is SRE.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE needs slos with consequences. SRE must have time to make tomorrow better. And number four, failure is an option. Failure is not something bad, it's something that we need to use.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Once upon a time we were working at a large enterprise. We had a global and diverse teams involved in continuous delivery. But we noticed that we suffered a lack of collaboration and sharing. So we decided to apply community of practices cops.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We decided to create our SRE site reliability engineering community of practices. Our second thought was about that learning experience, right? The experiential learning and learning by doing or walk the talk learning. Here are some ideas about how to implement this approach in your teams.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE Cop gives tips on how to create a successful SRE community. Focus on the purpose, audience, goal and expectation of the community. Please be sure to align community goals to business goals. Check topic by topic and share your experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE cop can help you to build, enable and develop SRE that replace capabilities as part of your business goals. To foster team collaboration, experimentation, outcome base, the people inside the community is going to get that. Your business grows as your communities and people grow.
