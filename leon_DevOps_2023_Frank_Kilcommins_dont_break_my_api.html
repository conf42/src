    <meta property="og:description" content="In this talk, I’ll introduce bi-directional contract testing, which empowers teams scale fast by leveraging existing artifacts, such as OpenAPI, and tooling investments to understand what’s breaking, what’s not, and when a break is a good choice! Let microservices be everywhere with confidence! 60+% of organizations cite microservices as a leading driver for API growth in the next 2 years. Teams continue to break down monolithic systems, seeking to capitalize on the advantages of decoupled capabilities - reduced costs, reduced TTM, faster releases, decentralized evolvability. Such benefits don't linearly scale! Managing the API sprawl is out weighting the benefits for many! Even with the solid extensibility design, governance workflows and high levels of automation, all of which leveraging OpenAPI and other leading specifications, it can be difficult to know what constitutes a breaking change to an API. What's the impact? Teams providing APIs lose sight of who their consumers are. Consumers lose track of what surface area of APIs they are using. In fact, any observable change in the behavior of an API will be deemed breaking by certain consumers (Hyrum’s Law). Can it be addressed? Contact testing with Pact, empowers providers and consumers to determine the impact of any change from their IDE. It addresses the coordination & communication challenges associated with delivering distributed systems. Thus calming the chaos caused by the microservices sprawl. Bi-directional contract testing capabilities in Pactflow, hits the sweet spot with design-first flows. Using provider-driven contract testing, developers can quickly scale by leveraging existing OpenAPI documentation investments to create tests reusing the same OpenAPI artifacts. One contract and lots of Pacts with your consumers! Walk away with? - Challenges in scaling microservices - Brief history of Pact & contract testing - Understanding of what Contract Testing is and how to get started - Understand the consumer and provider workflow for safely making changes - Overview of bi-directional contract testing leveraging OpenAPI (and other specs) - See API contract testing in action! - Know where to go, to get involved or learn more!"/>

<p>In this talk, I’ll introduce bi-directional contract testing, which empowers teams scale fast by leveraging existing artifacts, such as OpenAPI, and tooling investments to understand what’s breaking, what’s not, and when a break is a good choice! Let microservices be everywhere with confidence!
60+% of organizations cite microservices as a leading driver for API growth in the next 2 years. Teams continue to break down monolithic systems, seeking to capitalize on the advantages of decoupled capabilities - reduced costs, reduced TTM, faster releases, decentralized evolvability. Such benefits don&rsquo;t linearly scale! Managing the API sprawl is out weighting the benefits for many!
Even with the solid extensibility design, governance workflows and high levels of automation, all of which leveraging OpenAPI and other leading specifications, it can be difficult to know what constitutes a breaking change to an API.
What&rsquo;s the impact?
Teams providing APIs lose sight of who their consumers are. Consumers lose track of what surface area of APIs they are using. In fact, any observable change in the behavior of an API will be deemed breaking by certain consumers (Hyrum’s Law).
Can it be addressed?
Contact testing with Pact, empowers providers and consumers to determine the impact of any change from their IDE. It addresses the coordination &amp; communication challenges associated with delivering distributed systems. Thus calming the chaos caused by the microservices sprawl.
Bi-directional contract testing capabilities in Pactflow, hits the sweet spot with design-first flows. Using provider-driven contract testing, developers can quickly scale by leveraging existing OpenAPI documentation investments to create tests reusing the same OpenAPI artifacts. One contract and lots of Pacts with your consumers!

                How can we promote features through our APIs and evolve our APIs safely? We'll look at the relationship between the provider and the consumer in the modern API landscape.

                Frank Kilcommins is an API technical evangelist at Smartbear. He'll explore how bidirectional contract testing can help us safely evolve APIs. Hopefully you'll leave this talk with some takeaways and a good understanding around bi directional contract testing.

              <li>
                Microservices are the main catalyst for the continued growth across the API landscape. As much as 50% of microservices will not be managed by traditional API management tooling by 2025. That means there's a high risk that they will become zombie APIs. Strong design practices are key to ensuring long living APIs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If we're over relying on integration testing and into in testing, the testing pyramid is not really in hits optimal setup, especially for microservices. It's expensive to set up and maintain all of the underlying components and infrastructure. So delivering new value with the appropriate return on investment will be hard to achieve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How can you manage the dependencies between all of the provider components, all. of the consumer components, and manage those across the different environments? It can become quite a headache. If you multiply this by more environments, by many more components, you will get to a situation that can be difficult to manage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Bi directional contract testing is a way of testing microservices. It captures the interaction expectations between software component pairs. It supports a design first provider workflow, so it's well suited to starting on the provider side. It can help avoid many of the pitfalls that we have discussed up until now.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Bi directional contract testing can reduce your need for end to end testing and integration testing. It can significantly rebalance your costs with regards to testing and enables you to really safely evolve microservices. Hopefully you enjoyed my talk.
