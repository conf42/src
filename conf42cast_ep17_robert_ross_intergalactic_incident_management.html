            var transcript = [{"body": "Alright, so hello and welcome to another exciting episode of Conf42Cast. My name is Miko Pawlikowski, I\u0027ll be your guide. And today my guest is Robert Ross, the CEO of FireHydrant. How are you doing, Robert?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:09  ", "timestamp_s": 9}, {"body": "I\u0027m doing very well. How are you? ", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "0:21  ", "timestamp_s": 21}, {"body": "Doing great. Okay, I was tempted to call you Bobby Tables immediately, because I\u0027ve kind of been thinking about it a lot with the XKCD reference. Is that okay? Can I call you from now on?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:23  ", "timestamp_s": 23}, {"body": "Please, please do. It\u0027s been my nickname for over 10 years at this point. It\u0027s my GitHub, my Twitter, my Instagram. I think it\u0027s my LinkedIn. So yeah, I\u0027m very accustomed to that name at this point.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "0:33  ", "timestamp_s": 33}, {"body": "So how did it start? Did you just pick up a random XKCD and were like, \u0027Oh, I\u0027m Robert, this is Robbie, let\u0027s do that\u0027.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:45  ", "timestamp_s": 45}, {"body": "It wasn\u0027t even my choice, actually. Back when I was 19, I was working as a developer and two of my colleagues, three of my colleagues actually, started calling me Bobby Tables, because I think that was around when that comic came out. And one of the guys that changed my nickname since then, is actually my co-founder and head of engineering at FireHydrant now. That\u0027s how it started, I gained a nickname as a young adult, and it just hasn\u0027t gone away.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "0:52  ", "timestamp_s": 52}, {"body": "That\u0027s awesome. Because pretty much I think everybody I know knows the reference. So you know, that immediately gives you familiarity. So kudos for that. One other thing that everybody notices when they look up your trail on the internet is that you talk a lot about reliability. Pretty much everything, every piece of content I\u0027ve seen had something to do with reliability so far, be that a blog on the FireHydrant, or your YouTube video portfolio. So maybe a good place to start would be to define, kind of tell us, why reliability is so important to you. And what it even means, because it\u0027s one of those things that everybody knows where it is. But if you were to define, it might not be that easy. So what\u0027s your take on that, Bobby Tables?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:24  ", "timestamp_s": 84}, {"body": "My take on reliability is, I mean, if we kind of look around the world, reliability in software is more and more critical. We\u0027re using software right now to produce this podcast. And we\u0027re going to be using software to then publish this, and we use software to pay our bills and check our bank balances. And really, right now we\u0027re seeing software become more of a utility, than kind of like a nice to have. It\u0027s becoming almost as important as the water from our faucets and the electricity from our outlets. We expect it to just kind of work now, because we\u0027re so reliant on it. And when you\u0027re reliant on something, that thing we kind of have expectation of reliability of it working consistently. And what we say a FireHydrant is that reliability is not a an engineering metric. It\u0027s actually a business metric. And the way that we explain this is that, if we have an outage, and we have a high expectation for reliability for ourselves, but really, I should be saying, \"when\" we have an outage, people aren\u0027t going to be saying our customers or users people looking at our product, they\u0027re not going to say \u0027the FireHydrant engineering team is having an outage\u0027. This is not the way that we kind of think about products and brands, when they have outages, we say \u0027the company is down\u0027, right? So FireHydrant is down, or Slack is down, or the New York Times is down, right? Whatever the company is, we don\u0027t really think of it as a consumer of that product or technology as an engineering problem. We think of it as like a business problem. So that\u0027s why reliability to us, it\u0027s much more than engineering. It\u0027s beyond that. Legal needs to get involved, marketing gets involved. Almost every department at a company gets involved from massive outages. Many companies are paying millions of dollars in SLA refunds because of outages in the last couple of years. It\u0027s becoming an expensive thing for companies to experience these. So I mean, on the topic of like, what is reliability to me, us, my inner circle, it kind of extends beyond software. It\u0027s: do people perceive you as being reliable? And it\u0027s kind of an interesting metric. Reliability is not something you actually get to say. You don\u0027t get to say we\u0027re reliable. If a customer doesn\u0027t think you are reliable, you\u0027re not reliable. It\u0027s a weird kind of thing that you just have to be so reliable and so trustworthy to your customer base that they will kind of give you that, like badge, that you are reliable.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "2:08  ", "timestamp_s": 128}, {"body": "Absolutely agree with that and also what you mentioned by the client, it\u0027s easy to kind of lose that badge with a single incident, which kind of adds to the pressure of that. And obviously, depending on what kind of company or what kind of business you do your reliability metrics or understanding of that is going to be very different, right? Do you work with any particular types of companies? Or are you like flexible enough to kind of work from anybody, either from banking to, I don\u0027t know, dog walking?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "4:57  ", "timestamp_s": 297}, {"body": "We work with so many different companies. We work with consumer companies, we work with large B2B SaaS companies, really anyone operating software, at really any scale has a potential use case for an incident management tool. It could be us, it could be you know, wherever it is, but any company operating at some level of scale. Maybe the benchmark is they have a few customers, like that\u0027s probably already enough to start caring about reliable software. So really, we work with teams of all sizes and multiple industries.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "5:29  ", "timestamp_s": 329}, {"body": "So your sound like someone who does a lot of this. So if you were to come up with like a pizza recipe for reliability, what will be the ingredients in that? What goes into that?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "6:05  ", "timestamp_s": 365}, {"body": "How much dough do we have? This is gonna be a big pizza. I mean, it really depends on your business. If I were to have a recipe for reliability, wow, this is... I might make friends, I might make enemies with the way I answer this, so I\u0027m thinking a lot about it. I think the first case that I would really go for is making sure that everyone understands what reliability kind of means to your business. The first ingredient is \u0027buy in\u0027, making sure that everyone is bought in to this concept of reliability as not an afterthought. It is built into your products, it\u0027s built into your processes. And even if your systems fail, building in certain processes for your customers to know that something is broken, like all of that has buy in from customer success to marketing to legal, again, reliability is a business metric. So first first ingredient, \u0027buy in\u0027. I think second ingredient is partitioning off what your customers would complain about, and understanding the impacts of those things when they are down. And we call them \u0027functionalities\u0027, that\u0027s the term that we use. I\u0027ve heard \u0027product areas\u0027, \u0027product feature\u0027, or whatever you want to call it, that\u0027s fine. But really being able to break down your application to what the value is that you\u0027re providing to a customer. And the reason I think this is valuable in this recipe that I\u0027m coming up with right now is that if you don\u0027t know why people are using your product, or the things that can break. Or really the things that if they were unavailable, your customers would come running at you with pitchforks. You can\u0027t possibly build a reliable system, because you don\u0027t even know what needs to be reliable. And you don\u0027t even know what level of expectation your customers have for that thing being reliable. A classic example is, is it okay for an email, a daily update email to be an hour late? Probably, in most cases. Is it okay for Forgot Password email to be an hour late? No. So like, being able to understand the functionalities that your application provides. And honestly, it\u0027s gonna be a lot, it\u0027s not a small list. That\u0027s probably the second ingredient. So we\u0027re gonna buy in, we have knowing what can break and the expectations are like the what users are using that thing for, and why it\u0027s important to them. And then I think having an understanding of what breaking is. And this really starts to dive into like service level objectives, service level agreements. There\u0027s a bunch of great companies doing things for this, like Nobl9. They\u0027re helping companies kind of understand the impact of the systems when they are down and the agreements that they\u0027ve created for themselves and for customers when they\u0027re broken. I think that you have to know what the state of good is, like a measurable thing. And that\u0027s where an SLIs and SLOs kind of come into play. And then I think the third thing is ownership. Or fourth thing, I can\u0027t count, off by one error. Ownership is like, if no one owns anything, nothing will be reliable. If there\u0027s a certain thing that breaks and nobody actually owns that thing, you\u0027re gonna have a tragedy of the commons, where people will kind of look at it and go, \u0027Who\u0027s gonna fix it? Oh, someone will fix it\u0027, and they\u0027re gonna go do their own thing. So you have to have someone and you explicitly say, these functionalities, when these SLOs are not meeting their criteria, you own fixing that thing. And a lot of this is, you know, abstract and thought. But I think that if you have those four ingredients, and I would probably add a fifth ingredient, which is...", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "6:19  ", "timestamp_s": 379}, {"body": "FireHydrant. ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "10:18  ", "timestamp_s": 618}, {"body": "I could say that. But no, I think that the fifth ingredient is, knowing what to do and the expectations when something is unreliable. What is that process? Are you responsible for fixing it? Or you calling the fire department, are you calling 911? And then at that point, you should buy a FireHydrant. But that\u0027s all I\u0027m gonna say about that.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "10:18  ", "timestamp_s": 618}, {"body": "I was kind of looking at you counting fingers and I saw kind of the shadow of previous experiences. Can you share some anecdotes like you know, your favorite go-tos that you bring up at every family gathering about reliability? What\u0027s the most spectacular one that you can actually disclose?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "10:42  ", "timestamp_s": 642}, {"body": "So I\u0027ve worked for a couple of companies my career, I worked at DigitalOcean. In the past, I forgot namely, HR, where I was a staff SRE. And probably one of my favorite problems that we had all using an example from namely, I have two quick ones I\u0027ll share. One day, we saw that we were in a moratorium, the code moratorium, we weren\u0027t deploying anything new, no features are being released around in between, around Thanksgiving time, to the end of the year. And the reason that namely did that was because as a payroll tax software, a lot of people are off boarding off of namely, and onboarding onto namely, around that time, it\u0027s in HR world, that\u0027s called \u0027year end, year start\u0027. It\u0027s the busiest time of year for these companies. It\u0027s basically the highest risk time for something to break. So we are in our moratorium, we\u0027re in the office, and I\u0027m on the SRE team. And suddenly, the whole thing just goes down. And it was an interesting time, because as an engineer for a number of years, the first thing I always looked for is, \u0027well, what changed? What did we deploy?\u0027 And we were saying, \u0027oh, nothing deployed, we\u0027re in a moratorium\u0027. Okay, well, something changed. Did our data center get hit with a meteor, like what happened? And we\u0027re diving in. And the problem this is where ownership came to, was a problem is because there was no one, the application itself was broken, it was serving five hundreds. So at that point, is that the application team that should be responding to this? Or is it the SRE team that should be responding to this? So naturally, everyone responded to this and said, and then we had, in typical Thanksgiving form, too many cooks in the kitchen. And we had everyone was giving their theories and just as you have a lot of red herrings, and this outage went on for quite some time. And eventually, we realized that our Postgres database instance memory was getting super high, it wasn\u0027t out of memory, but it was climbing. And that actually put, I put the instance into, it was using more CPU cycles as well, because it was doing more work. And we were using an instance class of AWS that had four CPU credits. And we have exhausted the CPU credits. So that meant that our CPU suddenly grinded to a halt a little bit. And queries that were previously working very well, weren\u0027t. And then what we realized is that our memory was also going up at the same time, because we weren\u0027t deploying. We never hit this memory problem, where it was exhausting resources, basically, on this instance, because we were always deploying. Which was deploying our application, you might be wondering, well, if you\u0027re deploying your application, how does that affect your databases memory? Well, it turns out Ruby on Rails, our framework of choice had a problem where it was creating multiple prepared statements against our database. That uses a lot of memory and Postgres, because it\u0027s a new prepared statement per connection. And there were 16 connections per pod. And it was just a lot of prepared statements. But there was a Ruby on Rails bug that involved like date queries, or something like that. It was like a really, it\u0027s a known Ruby on Rails bug. So if you\u0027re on like Ruby on Rails 51, maybe you go look for this bug. And then eventually, we eventually realized because the graph would like do this every two days and we realized, oh, that\u0027s when we deploy on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was this like, crazy situation where a lot of people responding to the incident. Everyone in customer success was also in our incident channel. We had like 100 people responding to this incident, all because we didn\u0027t deploy. And that was really the crux of it. So, when I say like, my recipe is honestly based on incidents like that, where nobody knew what to do. And yeah. And I said I had another one, but I think that one kind of captures a lot. ", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "11:03  ", "timestamp_s": 663}, {"body": "I think that one will do. And it feels like a very good segue into incident response in general, right? If one goes to a certain firehydrant.com website, it seems to suggest that what we call \u0027incident response\u0027 is broken. Is that a true statement? At least the way it\u0027s done today. ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "15:21  ", "timestamp_s": 921}, {"body": "I talked to a lot of engineers, and when I posed the question, \u0027what\u0027s your incident response process like?\u0027 A lot of the time I\u0027ll get, I get like a set Edom of answers here. I\u0027ll get \"we don\u0027t have one\", \"it\u0027s chaos\" or \"it\u0027s outdated in confluence\", those are like the three answers I get. And sometimes it\u0027s \"we need to add a incident response process\". That\u0027s like the other category that you know. Yeah. So a lot of people tend to respond with \"it can be better\". I think that incident response is not a set it and forget it thing, it\u0027s going to evolve. Because your systems are going to evolve, your team structure is going to evolve. You\u0027re going to replace an application from Ruby to Go. Or if you\u0027re going like micro, if you\u0027re breaking microservices, that was super contrived example, but it happened multiple times in my career, like your incident response process is going to constantly evolve. And companies need to like recognize that. Really, all of your processes are going to evolve. But saying this is our incident response process. I mean, it\u0027s gonna change.

One other thing that I liked on the website, in the blog category, was about throwing away post mortems. And there was a few good options, I think my vote definitely goes to \u0027downy whoopsie\u0027. It\u0027s a good alternative. But what\u0027s wrong with post mortems?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "16:59  ", "timestamp_s": 1019}, {"body": "So if you look at the term \u0027post mortem\u0027, the definition for it, it usually involves, depending on which dictionary you look at, it\u0027s gonna involve word death and dying. And \u0027post death\u0027 is really what post mortem means. And the problem that I have with that is that people aren\u0027t dying, usually, right? Like, there are few software companies that it is a life or death situation. And maybe at that point, if they have that type of incident, maybe you do actually call it that. But for the most of us, in our roles and position, post mortem actually doesn\u0027t fit what you\u0027re doing. Actually you\u0027re running a incident retrospective, you are looking at what happened during an incident, the timeline of events, the multiple hypotheses and theories that were running around during the incident. Like you\u0027re running a retro on a shorter period of time that causes pain for people. So that\u0027s why I think post mortem is just isn\u0027t a good term. And actually,  there was a gentleman in Toronto that was telling me this, that their whole company was actually getting rid of the term post mortem. And I kind of latched on to that as an idea. Because databases are hard to change. Our database still actually has the table post mortems. But we actually relabeled our entire website, the interface to that database is actually retrospective everywhere now. And I\u0027d love to change it at some point. But schema changes are hard.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "17:20  ", "timestamp_s": 1040}, {"body": "Well, you should definitely add an option on the website to switch it to \u0027downy whoopsie\u0027.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "18:53  ", "timestamp_s": 1133}, {"body": "Downy whoopsie.

How is it different from things like pager duty, for example? What\u0027s the unique offering I guess?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "19:04  ", "timestamp_s": 1144}, {"body": "Yeah, we\u0027re building an integrated reliability platform. We are focused on incident management a lot today. But we also have an awesome service catalog component to our application as well. That involves change events and really like deploys, deploy tracking, built into the application. And we don\u0027t build anything into our product, we try as best as we can to avoid building siloed functionalities. We don\u0027t want to create something that doesn\u0027t improve the experience of existing functionality. So when FireHydrant first started the first parts of FireHydrant work was actually not Incident Management. The initial bedrock of the application was service catalog, it was the first database records created, was the first thing that the application had. And the reason for that is because to have appropriate Incident Management, at least in my opinion, when this was on a side project, before we became this company that we are today, we always wanted to know which services were impacted on which environment. So we built service catalog into FireHydrant, and then that just directly influences our incident management functionality. And then service catalog also has changed events that can link to services in the environments that they\u0027re running on, which then also get pulled into Incident Management automatically if something happened recently. So FireHydrant will actually say, \u0027Hey, did you know there was a recent deployed to this service on this environment, that you\u0027ve opened an incident for?\u0027 We\u0027re building it in a way that nothing in our application doesn\u0027t enhance or magnify something else in it. And I think that\u0027s a pretty big differentiator between us and other software vendors out there. We think that reliability, again, is a business metric, it touches so many parts of the business that you can\u0027t build, like featured silos for reliability, they have to all interact with each other.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "19:27  ", "timestamp_s": 1167}, {"body": "And what\u0027s the deployment model? Because that\u0027s always tricky with this kind of stuff that basically knows everything about what you\u0027re running. Is that software as a service kind of thing? Can you run it on prem? What\u0027s the deal?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "21:29  ", "timestamp_s": 1289}, {"body": "So we\u0027re exclusively a software as a service, we operate and host all of our application.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "21:46  ", "timestamp_s": 1306}, {"body": "Okay. And another question that came to my mind when you were describing that, I wonder who\u0027s like the primary person that you actually sell this kind of software to? Because I suspect that there\u0027s at least like two groups, right? The decision makers, like managers, whoever, who we say, \u0027Okay, guys, we should be using this and bring it to the team\u0027. Or just the software developers who are kind of upset or SREs who are kind of upset things are no better, and might suggest that. What\u0027s the best case scenario for that working in these two cases? Or maybe other cases that would be more popular for you?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "21:51  ", "timestamp_s": 1311}, {"body": "Yeah. So our wires, I mean, the people that use our tool the most are really like the engineering team, the people deploying applications and operating them. And the people that will help us integrate into the existing processes and things like that, that\u0027ll be a leader of some sort. Maybe it\u0027s a tech lead, maybe it\u0027s a manager, but we\u0027ve worked with incredible teams that the FireHydrant tool itself was implemented by the engineers. And that\u0027s why I kind of love what we\u0027re building is that we are our audience at the same time, and not a lot of people get the say that when the with the products that they\u0027re building. I love working at namely, great company. I am not passionate about payroll and tax software and benefits. That is not my calling, I couldn\u0027t tell you what features namely needed, right? I could build them, I could have someone say we should probably build this gross bonus calculator. Cool, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to come up with that myself. But with FireHydrant we get to say, \u0027You know what I wanted in my career, five years ago? I wanted this thing\u0027. And that really resonates with people that are looking at our software, you can kind of look at FireHydrant, as an engineer and SRE, whoever, and go, \u0027Oh, this is built by someone that had this problem\u0027. And that\u0027s why we kind of resonate the most with the ICs within an organization and anyone technical, anyone that\u0027s ever written code, we can have a full blown candid conversation with those people about our tool.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "22:31  ", "timestamp_s": 1351}, {"body": "From engineers to engineers. Awesome. And yeah, and that kind of naturally flows into the question about, so what\u0027s the startup life like? Starting things, growing them up, actually those series be fresh out of the process. How is that going for you? What\u0027s the best, the worst?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "24:03  ", "timestamp_s": 1443}, {"body": "Yeah, the best and the worst. So I think like a little bit of context, the joke that I like to say is that I accidentally started FireHydrant. It was a side project. It was something I was building for fun, nights and weekends, early morning coffee at 5am. And I like just started building this thing and it just happenstance, right place, right time raised a series seed for this and then that\u0027s really what started this company and my two co-founders, Dylan and Dan joined. Being totally honest and know competitors are going to listen to this and maybe weaponize it, but that\u0027s fine. But like we have no idea what we\u0027re doing. Like we were in the earliest days of startup, we were first time founders, you know, we wanted to build just a great product. That\u0027s all we really thought about was product. And we started by just heads down product, I think that we started to learn just how many acronyms there are in, like B2B sales, GTM. I remember at one point, I had to look up like what GTM meant, go to market. And then all the other acronyms like SQL MQL, you just kind of get overwhelmed with non-engineering things. And that started to happen, right around May of 2019, is when we started to like, Okay, we\u0027re going to start to like, push this, we\u0027re going to try to sell, make some sales here. And that\u0027s when I became a salesperson, a transition from engineering into sales. That was challenging. Because one of the things that I\u0027ve learned in this wonderful journey so far is that it\u0027s when you\u0027re good at something, you want to keep doing that thing that you\u0027re good at, right? You don\u0027t want to, at least for me, and I discovered that I always found myself like meddling back in the code base, I kind of always found myself like, I don\u0027t want to send this sales email. So I\u0027m gonna write this pull request for this feature that I want to build. That would just happen and happen. It took a long time to actually like, pull myself away from writing code. And I\u0027ll be honest, I still have a hard time with that. I think I actually shipped a PR today for something that was super small, I swear. Not giant new feature. And I think that that\u0027s been one of the hardest things and is a low some days because I love writing code. It\u0027s what I want to do. I like constructing things. I like building things. And it\u0027s hard to kind of change your mentality, right? Like, I\u0027m not building a codebase anymore. I\u0027m building a team, I\u0027m building a process for scaling this organization. I\u0027m building a company. I\u0027m trying to build a great company. It\u0027s systems thinking. But without the code editor, it\u0027s it\u0027s also one of the most rewarding things. I mean, we\u0027ve grown up to 68 employees, most of which we\u0027ve hired during a global pandemic. I mean, when the pandemic started, I think we had nine people. And now we\u0027re up to 68. That\u0027s a feat. I mean, that\u0027s a lot of people to hire remotely over zoom. That\u0027s a lot of interviews. And met most of the company I have not met in person, that has been a wild challenge, but super gratifying to build the company that I wish I could have worked out and that my co-founders wish that they could have worked at. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to do, that is kind of our Litmus test. Is FireHydrant a place that we would want to work at as a software engineer, as a salesperson as a marketer. Right? That\u0027s, that\u0027s our Litmus test. And that\u0027s what we kind of ask ourselves as much as we can to see if this is still the place that we would want to work.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "24:24  ", "timestamp_s": 1464}, {"body": "Love it. And I mean, the growing part of that during the pandemic, that\u0027s probably a topic for another episode entirely.

And we have 68 employees, and we\u0027re going on podcasts now\u0027. Like, there\u0027s just no way I would have predicted any of that. So it\u0027s super exciting. I feel incredibly fortunate.

Yeah, very happy for you. So since we\u0027re at it, lets me try to extract a little bit of, you know, golden nuggets for anybody who might want to follow your path. And, you know, in general career advice apart from don\u0027t know what to do. So if you were to like, give some actual serious advice to someone who wanted to be like, following an adventure like yours, what would be like the most important piece of advice that you would give them?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "29:13  ", "timestamp_s": 1753}, {"body": "The most important advice I can give you is your product will only feel as good as you feel. And what I mean by that is, don\u0027t overextend yourself. Don\u0027t work for 16 hours a day and think that that\u0027s going to like, do the trick. One thing that we\u0027ve really focused on here is a work-life balance. And I don\u0027t think I could ever, I don\u0027t think I can recommend anything more than take care of yourself. Because if you take care of yourself, you\u0027ll be able to take care of your company, and your products, and the things you want to do. Any day that I am not feeling great, I will go focus on that, because that\u0027s my new problem. That\u0027s the new biggest problem I have is not feeling great. So if your company is maybe having problems, I would actually kind of look inside, like, \u0027Are you having problems? Do you need a mental break? Do you need to not work on a weekend?\u0027 And it\u0027s a it\u0027s a struggle, because I think that there\u0027s a hustle culture in at least the United States and in startups and venture backed companies, there\u0027s a hustle culture where it\u0027s almost a competition to see who works the hardest. That\u0027s not the game you\u0027re playing. It\u0027s an infinite game. There\u0027s a book called \"The Infinite Game\" by Simon Sinek. And he basically says that there\u0027s no timer. It\u0027s not like a basketball game. There\u0027s no timer. There\u0027s no known rules, right? So why there\u0027s so many people out there saying like, \u0027I work 16 hours, like it\u0027s a badge of honor\u0027. Plenty of science out there says that you are not any more effective past eight hours at past 40 hours a week, like you were actually not more effective over time. So you might as well work 40 hours. And that was a long answer to a short question you gave me but I genuinely think that mental health and you operating at your best is the best thing that you can do for your company and your team.", "speaker": "Robert Ross", "timestamp": "29:41  ", "timestamp_s": 1781}, {"body": "That\u0027s a really nice answer.

But, um, I think the next big thing that we\u0027re gonna start seeing in technology is like contract-driven development. And what I mean by that is, I think that we\u0027re going to start to see, effectively, schematics of software before software is built more and more and more. And really, hugely successful open source projects are built this way. Hugely successful companies are built this way. Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln has a quote is that he\u0027s given five hours to chop down a tree, he\u0027s going to spend four hours sharpening the axe. And I think a lot of software companies in teams are if they\u0027re given five hours, they\u0027re just going to jump into their editor for five hours. And I think the biggest shift that I see coming in software is planning, like sharpening that axe for four hours. And I think it\u0027s going to be in the form of design docs, I think it\u0027s gonna be in the form of API schemas defined first, either using swagger or open API spec, maybe it\u0027s G RPC service definitions, Thrift, whatever it is, I genuinely think that that\u0027s going to be the next thing that we\u0027re going to change in our careers. And it\u0027s going to be, it\u0027s just going to make better software. If everyone in the world show you that as a standard, like imagine trying to go build a building without blueprint. Good luck.

            <p id="body-9" class="transcript-paragraph">Alright, so hello and welcome to another exciting episode of Conf42Cast. My name is Miko Pawlikowski, I'll be your guide. And today my guest is Robert Ross, the CEO of FireHydrant. How are you doing, Robert?</p>

            

            <p id="21">

            </p>
            <p id="body-21" class="transcript-paragraph">I'm doing very well. How are you? </p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-23" class="transcript-paragraph">Doing great. Okay, I was tempted to call you Bobby Tables immediately, because I've kind of been thinking about it a lot with the XKCD reference. Is that okay? Can I call you from now on?</p>

            

            <p id="33">
              <a href="#33" onclick="seek(33);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 0:33  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-33" class="transcript-paragraph">Please, please do. It's been my nickname for over 10 years at this point. It's my GitHub, my Twitter, my Instagram. I think it's my LinkedIn. So yeah, I'm very accustomed to that name at this point.</p>

            

            <p id="45">
              <a href="#45" onclick="seek(45);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 0:45  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-45" class="transcript-paragraph">So how did it start? Did you just pick up a random XKCD and were like, 'Oh, I'm Robert, this is Robbie, let's do that'.</p>

            

            <p id="52">
              <a href="#52" onclick="seek(52);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 0:52  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-52" class="transcript-paragraph">It wasn't even my choice, actually. Back when I was 19, I was working as a developer and two of my colleagues, three of my colleagues actually, started calling me Bobby Tables, because I think that was around when that comic came out. And one of the guys that changed my nickname since then, is actually my co-founder and head of engineering at FireHydrant now. That's how it started, I gained a nickname as a young adult, and it just hasn't gone away.</p>

            

            <p id="84">
              <a href="#84" onclick="seek(84);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 1:24  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-84" class="transcript-paragraph">That's awesome. Because pretty much I think everybody I know knows the reference. So you know, that immediately gives you familiarity. So kudos for that. One other thing that everybody notices when they look up your trail on the internet is that you talk a lot about reliability. Pretty much everything, every piece of content I've seen had something to do with reliability so far, be that a blog on the FireHydrant, or your YouTube video portfolio. So maybe a good place to start would be to define, kind of tell us, why reliability is so important to you. And what it even means, because it's one of those things that everybody knows where it is. But if you were to define, it might not be that easy. So what's your take on that, Bobby Tables?</p>

            

            <p id="128">
              <a href="#128" onclick="seek(128);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 2:08  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-128" class="transcript-paragraph">My take on reliability is, I mean, if we kind of look around the world, reliability in software is more and more critical. We're using software right now to produce this podcast. And we're going to be using software to then publish this, and we use software to pay our bills and check our bank balances. And really, right now we're seeing software become more of a utility, than kind of like a nice to have. It's becoming almost as important as the water from our faucets and the electricity from our outlets. We expect it to just kind of work now, because we're so reliant on it. And when you're reliant on something, that thing we kind of have expectation of reliability of it working consistently. And what we say a FireHydrant is that reliability is not a an engineering metric. It's actually a business metric. And the way that we explain this is that, if we have an outage, and we have a high expectation for reliability for ourselves, but really, I should be saying, "when" we have an outage, people aren't going to be saying our customers or users people looking at our product, they're not going to say 'the FireHydrant engineering team is having an outage'. This is not the way that we kind of think about products and brands, when they have outages, we say 'the company is down', right? So FireHydrant is down, or Slack is down, or the New York Times is down, right? Whatever the company is, we don't really think of it as a consumer of that product or technology as an engineering problem. We think of it as like a business problem. So that's why reliability to us, it's much more than engineering. It's beyond that. Legal needs to get involved, marketing gets involved. Almost every department at a company gets involved from massive outages. Many companies are paying millions of dollars in SLA refunds because of outages in the last couple of years. It's becoming an expensive thing for companies to experience these. So I mean, on the topic of like, what is reliability to me, us, my inner circle, it kind of extends beyond software. It's: do people perceive you as being reliable? And it's kind of an interesting metric. Reliability is not something you actually get to say. You don't get to say we're reliable. If a customer doesn't think you are reliable, you're not reliable. It's a weird kind of thing that you just have to be so reliable and so trustworthy to your customer base that they will kind of give you that, like badge, that you are reliable.</p>

            

            <p id="297">
              <a href="#297" onclick="seek(297);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 4:57  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-297" class="transcript-paragraph">Absolutely agree with that and also what you mentioned by the client, it's easy to kind of lose that badge with a single incident, which kind of adds to the pressure of that. And obviously, depending on what kind of company or what kind of business you do your reliability metrics or understanding of that is going to be very different, right? Do you work with any particular types of companies? Or are you like flexible enough to kind of work from anybody, either from banking to, I don't know, dog walking?</p>

            

            <p id="329">
              <a href="#329" onclick="seek(329);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 5:29  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-329" class="transcript-paragraph">We work with so many different companies. We work with consumer companies, we work with large B2B SaaS companies, really anyone operating software, at really any scale has a potential use case for an incident management tool. It could be us, it could be you know, wherever it is, but any company operating at some level of scale. Maybe the benchmark is they have a few customers, like that's probably already enough to start caring about reliable software. So really, we work with teams of all sizes and multiple industries.</p>

            

            <p id="365">
              <a href="#365" onclick="seek(365);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 6:05  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-365" class="transcript-paragraph">So your sound like someone who does a lot of this. So if you were to come up with like a pizza recipe for reliability, what will be the ingredients in that? What goes into that?</p>

            

            <p id="379">
              <a href="#379" onclick="seek(379);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 6:19  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-379" class="transcript-paragraph">How much dough do we have? This is gonna be a big pizza. I mean, it really depends on your business. If I were to have a recipe for reliability, wow, this is... I might make friends, I might make enemies with the way I answer this, so I'm thinking a lot about it. I think the first case that I would really go for is making sure that everyone understands what reliability kind of means to your business. The first ingredient is 'buy in', making sure that everyone is bought in to this concept of reliability as not an afterthought. It is built into your products, it's built into your processes. And even if your systems fail, building in certain processes for your customers to know that something is broken, like all of that has buy in from customer success to marketing to legal, again, reliability is a business metric. So first first ingredient, 'buy in'. I think second ingredient is partitioning off what your customers would complain about, and understanding the impacts of those things when they are down. And we call them 'functionalities', that's the term that we use. I've heard 'product areas', 'product feature', or whatever you want to call it, that's fine. But really being able to break down your application to what the value is that you're providing to a customer. And the reason I think this is valuable in this recipe that I'm coming up with right now is that if you don't know why people are using your product, or the things that can break. Or really the things that if they were unavailable, your customers would come running at you with pitchforks. You can't possibly build a reliable system, because you don't even know what needs to be reliable. And you don't even know what level of expectation your customers have for that thing being reliable. A classic example is, is it okay for an email, a daily update email to be an hour late? Probably, in most cases. Is it okay for Forgot Password email to be an hour late? No. So like, being able to understand the functionalities that your application provides. And honestly, it's gonna be a lot, it's not a small list. That's probably the second ingredient. So we're gonna buy in, we have knowing what can break and the expectations are like the what users are using that thing for, and why it's important to them. And then I think having an understanding of what breaking is. And this really starts to dive into like service level objectives, service level agreements. There's a bunch of great companies doing things for this, like Nobl9. They're helping companies kind of understand the impact of the systems when they are down and the agreements that they've created for themselves and for customers when they're broken. I think that you have to know what the state of good is, like a measurable thing. And that's where an SLIs and SLOs kind of come into play. And then I think the third thing is ownership. Or fourth thing, I can't count, off by one error. Ownership is like, if no one owns anything, nothing will be reliable. If there's a certain thing that breaks and nobody actually owns that thing, you're gonna have a tragedy of the commons, where people will kind of look at it and go, 'Who's gonna fix it? Oh, someone will fix it', and they're gonna go do their own thing. So you have to have someone and you explicitly say, these functionalities, when these SLOs are not meeting their criteria, you own fixing that thing. And a lot of this is, you know, abstract and thought. But I think that if you have those four ingredients, and I would probably add a fifth ingredient, which is...</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-618" class="transcript-paragraph">I could say that. But no, I think that the fifth ingredient is, knowing what to do and the expectations when something is unreliable. What is that process? Are you responsible for fixing it? Or you calling the fire department, are you calling 911? And then at that point, you should buy a FireHydrant. But that's all I'm gonna say about that.</p>

              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-642" class="transcript-paragraph">I was kind of looking at you counting fingers and I saw kind of the shadow of previous experiences. Can you share some anecdotes like you know, your favorite go-tos that you bring up at every family gathering about reliability? What's the most spectacular one that you can actually disclose?</p>

            

            <p id="663">
              <a href="#663" onclick="seek(663);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 11:03  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-663" class="transcript-paragraph">So I've worked for a couple of companies my career, I worked at DigitalOcean. In the past, I forgot namely, HR, where I was a staff SRE. And probably one of my favorite problems that we had all using an example from namely, I have two quick ones I'll share. One day, we saw that we were in a moratorium, the code moratorium, we weren't deploying anything new, no features are being released around in between, around Thanksgiving time, to the end of the year. And the reason that namely did that was because as a payroll tax software, a lot of people are off boarding off of namely, and onboarding onto namely, around that time, it's in HR world, that's called 'year end, year start'. It's the busiest time of year for these companies. It's basically the highest risk time for something to break. So we are in our moratorium, we're in the office, and I'm on the SRE team. And suddenly, the whole thing just goes down. And it was an interesting time, because as an engineer for a number of years, the first thing I always looked for is, 'well, what changed? What did we deploy?' And we were saying, 'oh, nothing deployed, we're in a moratorium'. Okay, well, something changed. Did our data center get hit with a meteor, like what happened? And we're diving in. And the problem this is where ownership came to, was a problem is because there was no one, the application itself was broken, it was serving five hundreds. So at that point, is that the application team that should be responding to this? Or is it the SRE team that should be responding to this? So naturally, everyone responded to this and said, and then we had, in typical Thanksgiving form, too many cooks in the kitchen. And we had everyone was giving their theories and just as you have a lot of red herrings, and this outage went on for quite some time. And eventually, we realized that our Postgres database instance memory was getting super high, it wasn't out of memory, but it was climbing. And that actually put, I put the instance into, it was using more CPU cycles as well, because it was doing more work. And we were using an instance class of AWS that had four CPU credits. And we have exhausted the CPU credits. So that meant that our CPU suddenly grinded to a halt a little bit. And queries that were previously working very well, weren't. And then what we realized is that our memory was also going up at the same time, because we weren't deploying. We never hit this memory problem, where it was exhausting resources, basically, on this instance, because we were always deploying. Which was deploying our application, you might be wondering, well, if you're deploying your application, how does that affect your databases memory? Well, it turns out Ruby on Rails, our framework of choice had a problem where it was creating multiple prepared statements against our database. That uses a lot of memory and Postgres, because it's a new prepared statement per connection. And there were 16 connections per pod. And it was just a lot of prepared statements. But there was a Ruby on Rails bug that involved like date queries, or something like that. It was like a really, it's a known Ruby on Rails bug. So if you're on like Ruby on Rails 51, maybe you go look for this bug. And then eventually, we eventually realized because the graph would like do this every two days and we realized, oh, that's when we deploy on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was this like, crazy situation where a lot of people responding to the incident. Everyone in customer success was also in our incident channel. We had like 100 people responding to this incident, all because we didn't deploy. And that was really the crux of it. So, when I say like, my recipe is honestly based on incidents like that, where nobody knew what to do. And yeah. And I said I had another one, but I think that one kind of captures a lot. </p>

              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-921" class="transcript-paragraph">I think that one will do. And it feels like a very good segue into incident response in general, right? If one goes to a certain firehydrant.com website, it seems to suggest that what we call 'incident response' is broken. Is that a true statement? At least the way it's done today. </p>

            

            <p id="944">
              <a href="#944" onclick="seek(944);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 15:44  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-944" class="transcript-paragraph">I talked to a lot of engineers, and when I posed the question, 'what's your incident response process like?' A lot of the time I'll get, I get like a set Edom of answers here. I'll get "we don't have one", "it's chaos" or "it's outdated in confluence", those are like the three answers I get. And sometimes it's "we need to add a incident response process". That's like the other category that you know. Yeah. So a lot of people tend to respond with "it can be better". I think that incident response is not a set it and forget it thing, it's going to evolve. Because your systems are going to evolve, your team structure is going to evolve. You're going to replace an application from Ruby to Go. Or if you're going like micro, if you're breaking microservices, that was super contrived example, but it happened multiple times in my career, like your incident response process is going to constantly evolve. And companies need to like recognize that. Really, all of your processes are going to evolve. But saying this is our incident response process. I mean, it's gonna change. So our headline on our website is really to talking to that.</p>

            

            <p id="1019">
              <a href="#1019" onclick="seek(1019);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 16:59  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-1019" class="transcript-paragraph">Fair enough. One other thing that I liked on the website, in the blog category, was about throwing away post mortems. And there was a few good options, I think my vote definitely goes to 'downy whoopsie'. It's a good alternative. But what's wrong with post mortems?</p>

            

            <p id="1040">
              <a href="#1040" onclick="seek(1040);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 17:20  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1040" class="transcript-paragraph">So if you look at the term 'post mortem', the definition for it, it usually involves, depending on which dictionary you look at, it's gonna involve word death and dying. And 'post death' is really what post mortem means. And the problem that I have with that is that people aren't dying, usually, right? Like, there are few software companies that it is a life or death situation. And maybe at that point, if they have that type of incident, maybe you do actually call it that. But for the most of us, in our roles and position, post mortem actually doesn't fit what you're doing. Actually you're running a incident retrospective, you are looking at what happened during an incident, the timeline of events, the multiple hypotheses and theories that were running around during the incident. Like you're running a retro on a shorter period of time that causes pain for people. So that's why I think post mortem is just isn't a good term. And actually,  there was a gentleman in Toronto that was telling me this, that their whole company was actually getting rid of the term post mortem. And I kind of latched on to that as an idea. Because databases are hard to change. Our database still actually has the table post mortems. But we actually relabeled our entire website, the interface to that database is actually retrospective everywhere now. And I'd love to change it at some point. But schema changes are hard.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1133" class="transcript-paragraph">Well, you should definitely add an option on the website to switch it to 'downy whoopsie'.</p>

            <p id="body-1144" class="transcript-paragraph">Okay, so we've been kind of, you know, walking around the aisles of reliability incident response, and you've vented at some of your frustration, so let's hit now directly at the hot FireHydrant and to tell me how is it different from the other offerings? How is it different from things like pager duty, for example? What's the unique offering I guess?</p>

            

            <p id="1167">
              <a href="#1167" onclick="seek(1167);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 19:27  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1167" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, we're building an integrated reliability platform. We are focused on incident management a lot today. But we also have an awesome service catalog component to our application as well. That involves change events and really like deploys, deploy tracking, built into the application. And we don't build anything into our product, we try as best as we can to avoid building siloed functionalities. We don't want to create something that doesn't improve the experience of existing functionality. So when FireHydrant first started the first parts of FireHydrant work was actually not Incident Management. The initial bedrock of the application was service catalog, it was the first database records created, was the first thing that the application had. And the reason for that is because to have appropriate Incident Management, at least in my opinion, when this was on a side project, before we became this company that we are today, we always wanted to know which services were impacted on which environment. So we built service catalog into FireHydrant, and then that just directly influences our incident management functionality. And then service catalog also has changed events that can link to services in the environments that they're running on, which then also get pulled into Incident Management automatically if something happened recently. So FireHydrant will actually say, 'Hey, did you know there was a recent deployed to this service on this environment, that you've opened an incident for?' We're building it in a way that nothing in our application doesn't enhance or magnify something else in it. And I think that's a pretty big differentiator between us and other software vendors out there. We think that reliability, again, is a business metric, it touches so many parts of the business that you can't build, like featured silos for reliability, they have to all interact with each other.</p>

            <p id="body-1289" class="transcript-paragraph">And what's the deployment model? Because that's always tricky with this kind of stuff that basically knows everything about what you're running. Is that software as a service kind of thing? Can you run it on prem? What's the deal?</p>

            

            <p id="1306">

              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1306" class="transcript-paragraph">So we're exclusively a software as a service, we operate and host all of our application.</p>

            

            <p id="1311">
              <a href="#1311" onclick="seek(1311);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 21:51  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-1311" class="transcript-paragraph">Okay. And another question that came to my mind when you were describing that, I wonder who's like the primary person that you actually sell this kind of software to? Because I suspect that there's at least like two groups, right? The decision makers, like managers, whoever, who we say, 'Okay, guys, we should be using this and bring it to the team'. Or just the software developers who are kind of upset or SREs who are kind of upset things are no better, and might suggest that. What's the best case scenario for that working in these two cases? Or maybe other cases that would be more popular for you?</p>

            

            <p id="1351">
              <a href="#1351" onclick="seek(1351);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 22:31  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1351" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah. So our wires, I mean, the people that use our tool the most are really like the engineering team, the people deploying applications and operating them. And the people that will help us integrate into the existing processes and things like that, that'll be a leader of some sort. Maybe it's a tech lead, maybe it's a manager, but we've worked with incredible teams that the FireHydrant tool itself was implemented by the engineers. And that's why I kind of love what we're building is that we are our audience at the same time, and not a lot of people get the say that when the with the products that they're building. I love working at namely, great company. I am not passionate about payroll and tax software and benefits. That is not my calling, I couldn't tell you what features namely needed, right? I could build them, I could have someone say we should probably build this gross bonus calculator. Cool, I wouldn't have been able to come up with that myself. But with FireHydrant we get to say, 'You know what I wanted in my career, five years ago? I wanted this thing'. And that really resonates with people that are looking at our software, you can kind of look at FireHydrant, as an engineer and SRE, whoever, and go, 'Oh, this is built by someone that had this problem'. And that's why we kind of resonate the most with the ICs within an organization and anyone technical, anyone that's ever written code, we can have a full blown candid conversation with those people about our tool.</p>

            <p id="body-1443" class="transcript-paragraph">From engineers to engineers. Awesome. And yeah, and that kind of naturally flows into the question about, so what's the startup life like? Starting things, growing them up, actually those series be fresh out of the process. How is that going for you? What's the best, the worst?</p>

            

            <p id="1464">
              <a href="#1464" onclick="seek(1464);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 24:24  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1464" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, the best and the worst. So I think like a little bit of context, the joke that I like to say is that I accidentally started FireHydrant. It was a side project. It was something I was building for fun, nights and weekends, early morning coffee at 5am. And I like just started building this thing and it just happenstance, right place, right time raised a series seed for this and then that's really what started this company and my two co-founders, Dylan and Dan joined. Being totally honest and know competitors are going to listen to this and maybe weaponize it, but that's fine. But like we have no idea what we're doing. Like we were in the earliest days of startup, we were first time founders, you know, we wanted to build just a great product. That's all we really thought about was product. And we started by just heads down product, I think that we started to learn just how many acronyms there are in, like B2B sales, GTM. I remember at one point, I had to look up like what GTM meant, go to market. And then all the other acronyms like SQL MQL, you just kind of get overwhelmed with non-engineering things. And that started to happen, right around May of 2019, is when we started to like, Okay, we're going to start to like, push this, we're going to try to sell, make some sales here. And that's when I became a salesperson, a transition from engineering into sales. That was challenging. Because one of the things that I've learned in this wonderful journey so far is that it's when you're good at something, you want to keep doing that thing that you're good at, right? You don't want to, at least for me, and I discovered that I always found myself like meddling back in the code base, I kind of always found myself like, I don't want to send this sales email. So I'm gonna write this pull request for this feature that I want to build. That would just happen and happen. It took a long time to actually like, pull myself away from writing code. And I'll be honest, I still have a hard time with that. I think I actually shipped a PR today for something that was super small, I swear. Not giant new feature. And I think that that's been one of the hardest things and is a low some days because I love writing code. It's what I want to do. I like constructing things. I like building things. And it's hard to kind of change your mentality, right? Like, I'm not building a codebase anymore. I'm building a team, I'm building a process for scaling this organization. I'm building a company. I'm trying to build a great company. It's systems thinking. But without the code editor, it's it's also one of the most rewarding things. I mean, we've grown up to 68 employees, most of which we've hired during a global pandemic. I mean, when the pandemic started, I think we had nine people. And now we're up to 68. That's a feat. I mean, that's a lot of people to hire remotely over zoom. That's a lot of interviews. And met most of the company I have not met in person, that has been a wild challenge, but super gratifying to build the company that I wish I could have worked out and that my co-founders wish that they could have worked at. And that's what we're trying to do, that is kind of our Litmus test. Is FireHydrant a place that we would want to work at as a software engineer, as a salesperson as a marketer. Right? That's, that's our Litmus test. And that's what we kind of ask ourselves as much as we can to see if this is still the place that we would want to work.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1718" class="transcript-paragraph">Sorry. Yeah. I mean, I did not. If you had asked me three years ago, which was when FireHydrant would have still been a side project right about now is when the fundraising surface recede, I don't think I would have ever have said, 'Hey, we are working with these companies. And we have 68 employees, and we're going on podcasts now'. Like, there's just no way I would have predicted any of that. So it's super exciting. I feel incredibly fortunate. I am very fortunate to be in the position that I am and and working with the team at FireHydrant.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1753" class="transcript-paragraph">Awesome. Yeah, very happy for you. So since we're at it, lets me try to extract a little bit of, you know, golden nuggets for anybody who might want to follow your path. And, you know, in general career advice apart from don't know what to do. So if you were to like, give some actual serious advice to someone who wanted to be like, following an adventure like yours, what would be like the most important piece of advice that you would give them?</p>

            

            <p id="1781">
              <a href="#1781" onclick="seek(1781);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 29:41  </a>
              Robert Ross
            </p>
            <p id="body-1781" class="transcript-paragraph">The most important advice I can give you is your product will only feel as good as you feel. And what I mean by that is, don't overextend yourself. Don't work for 16 hours a day and think that that's going to like, do the trick. One thing that we've really focused on here is a work-life balance. And I don't think I could ever, I don't think I can recommend anything more than take care of yourself. Because if you take care of yourself, you'll be able to take care of your company, and your products, and the things you want to do. Any day that I am not feeling great, I will go focus on that, because that's my new problem. That's the new biggest problem I have is not feeling great. So if your company is maybe having problems, I would actually kind of look inside, like, 'Are you having problems? Do you need a mental break? Do you need to not work on a weekend?' And it's a it's a struggle, because I think that there's a hustle culture in at least the United States and in startups and venture backed companies, there's a hustle culture where it's almost a competition to see who works the hardest. That's not the game you're playing. It's an infinite game. There's a book called "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek. And he basically says that there's no timer. It's not like a basketball game. There's no timer. There's no known rules, right? So why there's so many people out there saying like, 'I work 16 hours, like it's a badge of honor'. Plenty of science out there says that you are not any more effective past eight hours at past 40 hours a week, like you were actually not more effective over time. So you might as well work 40 hours. And that was a long answer to a short question you gave me but I genuinely think that mental health and you operating at your best is the best thing that you can do for your company and your team.</p>

            <p id="body-1897" class="transcript-paragraph">That's a really nice answer. And it's definitely coming from the CEO part of you. In that case, a bonus question for the coder in you, what's the most exciting tech thing, technology, language, whatever that's coming, that's worth following. </p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1918" class="transcript-paragraph">I'm excited to see, this is not gonna be tech or, you know, a framework or anything. And I'm sorry, I know that people love to hear it's going to be Go or Russ store and like Go's already kind of there. But, um, I think the next big thing that we're gonna start seeing in technology is like contract-driven development. And what I mean by that is, I think that we're going to start to see, effectively, schematics of software before software is built more and more and more. And really, hugely successful open source projects are built this way. Hugely successful companies are built this way. Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln has a quote is that he's given five hours to chop down a tree, he's going to spend four hours sharpening the axe. And I think a lot of software companies in teams are if they're given five hours, they're just going to jump into their editor for five hours. And I think the biggest shift that I see coming in software is planning, like sharpening that axe for four hours. And I think it's going to be in the form of design docs, I think it's gonna be in the form of API schemas defined first, either using swagger or open API spec, maybe it's G RPC service definitions, Thrift, whatever it is, I genuinely think that that's going to be the next thing that we're going to change in our careers. And it's going to be, it's just going to make better software. If everyone in the world show you that as a standard, like imagine trying to go build a building without blueprint. Good luck. So I know it's probably not the answer you're looking for. But I think that that's what's coming.</p>
