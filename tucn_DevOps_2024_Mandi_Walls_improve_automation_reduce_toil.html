                Mandy walls is a DevOps advocate at Pagerduty. We'll talk about some automation and hopefully controlling some toil with automation. If you like, get in touch with me. I'm happy to chat about stuff.

              <li>
                When organizations get larger and their services get more complex, you start to naturally see some of this siloing off. How much organizational expertise gets shared varies from team to team, right? We need a way of dealing with getting through all this stuff.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We can use AI to help build automation. You may have more or less success with this, depending on the nature of your environment. But automation itself isn't AI. Even if we're using AI tools, we still need to invest people hours into maintaining it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Right. We also want things to be repeatable. I want to run the same every time the tool runs. And I want that to be centralized. So there's not a lot of confusion that I don't have to then deal with.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are designing for delegation to another team. Part of that is going to be supporting how our users work. We also want to provide results that make sense whether things are successful or not. This leads really well into folks on a platform engineering journey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can also think about automating the tasks that you do most often or the stuff that takes the most time. And get yourself to the point where you figure out okay, we're going to get back x number of person hours every week by automation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Starting on the left we have automation opportunities. The most common one is human initiated automation. This is automation that runs on its own in response to some environmental trigger. Not all of your tasks are going to reach all of these phases. If you want to talk about Pagerduty, we are always available.
