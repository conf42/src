    <meta property="og:description" content="What tactics can you use to implement service level objectives and error budgets to operate enterprise-level services with a thousand (or more) engineers? Fred Moyer takes you through approaches heâ€™s developed working with teams in a large production ecosystem where service reliability was a nonnegotiable business requirement. Engineers and operations folks who are putting SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets into practice in high-scale production environments with diverse service architectures should come away with an understanding of how to democratize SLOs, what objectives they should target for enterprise-level reliability, and how to communicate and implement error budgets across multiple teams."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>What tactics can you use to implement service level objectives and
error budgets to operate enterprise-level services with a thousand (or
more) engineers? Fred Moyer takes you through approaches heâ€™s
developed working with teams in a large production ecosystem where
service reliability was a nonnegotiable business requirement.
Engineers and operations folks who are putting SLIs, SLOs, and error
budgets into practice in high-scale production environments with
diverse service architectures should come away with an understanding
of how to democratize SLOs, what objectives they should target for
enterprise-level reliability, and how to communicate and implement
error budgets across multiple teams.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                I'm proud to be presenting here at Conf 42 observability in 2023. This talk is about techniques for slos and air budgets at scale. This is basically the greatest its version of the previous talks I've given on the subject.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Fred: I'm a observability engineer at a large public company. This talk is my own opinions, not those my employers. Raise your hand if you know what this graph is. We're all here today in part because of this thing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do you implement slos for 1000 plus engineers? There wasn't really a prescription for slis and slos. So I got to work creating formulas that can be shared across a large organization. Here is what I came up with.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need real world examples. Present formulas for each of those entities which can be read easily both by humans and machines. Third, you have to be detailed and consistent. This is what enterprise customers demand these days.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Of the two components of latency and availability, availability is generally pretty easy to measure. Web page latency is more difficult to get right at scale. There are two aspects of being right. First, does your measurement have the right precision for your scale?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a couple of different approaches you can use for measuring latency with histogram. Many tools will happily let you use an averaging function for percentiles generated from different hosts, nodes or clusters. But when your services are behaving asymmetrically, you'll encounter errors with this approach.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A recent blog post highlights some recent work in this area. Using r based tooling to decompose telemetry into component normalish distributions. These can be used to implement fine grained slos for each of the different moyer of the system in the cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One approach is to use an SLO and error budget for each service. This includes third party vendor services, as shown in blue here. You can roll those error rates up and get a composite error rate. The goal here is not to assign blames to teams or to different services. It's to prioritize reliability work.

              </li>
