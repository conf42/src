    <meta property="og:description" content="We’re all familiar with Murphy’s Law. “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” And over time, Murphy’s Law has been extended, abstracted and applied to numerous disciplines.  Within Observability, the extension of data and monitoring focused on deep insights in our complex apps and environments, Murphy’s Law also reigns supreme. But what laws apply and how do we mitigate impact of points like: * Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, at the worst possible time * Computers always side with the hidden flaw * You can never run out of things that can go wrong * Availability is a function of time  We’ll look into examples of the laws in practice and highlight practices that might just give you the one-up on Murphy.

<!-- Text -->
<p>We’re all familiar with Murphy’s Law. “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” And over time, Murphy’s Law has been extended, abstracted and applied to numerous disciplines. 
Within Observability, the extension of data and monitoring focused on deep insights in our complex apps and environments, Murphy’s Law also reigns supreme. But what laws apply and how do we mitigate impact of points like:
* Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, at the worst possible time
* Computers always side with the hidden flaw
* You can never run out of things that can go wrong
* Availability is a function of time</p>
<p>We’ll look into examples of the laws in practice and highlight practices that might just give you the one-up on Murphy. </p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Dave McAllister is the open source technology evangelist at NginX. He talks about Murphy's laws for observability. You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are lots of Murphy's categories, and in fact I'm introducing one now here. There are things like Murphy's technologies laws, or Murphy's military law. People are constantly coming up with new things that make sense for a Murphy's law approach.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong, a fifth, why unprepared for will promptly develop. Our jobs are to try to both mitigate what could happen has well as be prepared for that fifth way to show up. We need to know what's going on at all times.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Observability is really all around data. It's the deep sources of data that let us see what's going on inside of our systems. And interestingly enough, observability really is a proxy for customer happiness.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every solution breeds new problems. Now that we've got this new data, we now have a whole new class of issues. With microservices, a service that is as small as necessary, we find that traditional monitoring can't save us anymore. Complex environment means we need to probe deeper.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 observability lets us start monitoring for those things called unknown unknowns. When we move into that last category, we're not even aware something could occur. Metrics are the piece that lets us know when something has gone wrong. But nothing is as easy as it looks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Testing for production is not the same as running in production. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong and it will show up when you hit scale. How do you keep track of what's going on?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Data is only as useful as you can aggregate it, analyze it, visualize it, and respond to it. Observability needs both accuracy and precision. But again, that aggregation and analysis can skew this behavior.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry covers traces, metrics, and is in the process of covering logs. The collector architecture allows us to tie those together. This means if you already got solutions in place, it's very easy to pull to an open telemetry without disrupting your current work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Numbers are tools. They are not rules. Prediction is only as good as the data. Extrapolation is better closer to the point of contact. Make sure that your use of observability brings into the capability of sharing the data, not just a result.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
