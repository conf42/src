              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Max Livier is a software developer at heart, but now in the world of product. Has spent the last ten years working in various SaaS startups. Has begun working on the open source project Cerbos, which is now a company. Talk will cover what authorization is, why you may think you have a simple solution today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Today we're going to be talking about authorization with a z or a z rather than authentication. What can they actually do inside of my application? What are they authorized to access? What actions can they perform? How roles evolve as your application and your business scales.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 GDPR, CCPA, and various other kind of data locality and data security regulations. Now you need to add permissioning and logic checks in your application code to make sure that users are in the right region. There's now quite a large number of libraries that you can embed into various specific languages.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Enterprise businesses have large employee, large employee bases. They need to have clear denierations between groups and regions. With that comes a lot of controls that need to be put in place. One of those is around logging.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are just some components that make sense as standalone services. All that business logic that's been written for authorizing access has to be replicated into n number of languages. Can you confidently say that every service in every language is behaving as it should? There's a proposal of a new approach which is decoupled authorization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In a decoupled approach, you extract all that business logic out into an authorization service that's running alongside your app. It massively shrinks, simplifies the application code, but gives you the power of flexibility of policy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Do not reinvent the wheel of authorization. It's going to be a never ending headache. There's projects out there now that can do it all for you. So you can forget about it and move on with your life and really focus on building that business value.
