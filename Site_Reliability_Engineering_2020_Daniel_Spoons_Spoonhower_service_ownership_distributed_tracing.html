    <meta property="og:description" content="While many organizations are rolling out Kubernetes, breaking up their monoliths, and adopting DevOps practices with the hope of increasing developer velocity and improving reliability, it’s not enough just to put these tools in the hands of developers: you’ve got to incentivize developers to use them. Service ownership provides these incentives, by holding teams accountable for metrics like the performance and reliability of their services as well as by giving them the agency to improve those metrics.  In this talk, I’ll cover how distributed tracing can serve as the backbone of service ownership. For SRE teams that are setting standards for their organizations, it can help drive things like documentation, communication, on-call processes, and SLOs by providing a single source of truth for what’s happening across the entire application. For embedded SRE teams, it can also accelerate root cause analysis and make alerts more actionable by showing developers what’s changed – even if that change was a dozen services away. Throughout the talk, I’ll use examples drawn from more than a decade of experience with SRE teams in organizations big and small."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>While many organizations are rolling out Kubernetes, breaking up their monoliths, and adopting DevOps practices with the hope of increasing developer velocity and improving reliability, it’s not enough just to put these tools in the hands of developers: you’ve got to incentivize developers to use them. Service ownership provides these incentives, by holding teams accountable for metrics like the performance and reliability of their services as well as by giving them the agency to improve those metrics.</p>
<p>In this talk, I’ll cover how distributed tracing can serve as the backbone of service ownership. For SRE teams that are setting standards for their organizations, it can help drive things like documentation, communication, on-call processes, and SLOs by providing a single source of truth for what’s happening across the entire application. For embedded SRE teams, it can also accelerate root cause analysis and make alerts more actionable by showing developers what’s changed – even if that change was a dozen services away. Throughout the talk, I’ll use examples drawn from more than a decade of experience with SRE teams in organizations big and small.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Daniel Spoonhauer is CTO and co founder of Lightstep. He talks about driving service ownership with distributed tracing. Before Lightstep, he was a software engineer at Google.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Many engineering organizations are adopting services or other kinds of similar systems. What does that mean for how we work together? We've also changed the way that we build these systems. With these shift to more loosely coupled services, it requires a new way of thinking about how we observe systems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 distributed tracing is really that process, that art hands science of deriving value from those traces. I also want to say I wrote the book on distributed tracing, so if there's more you want to learn about it, I strongly recommend this book.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service ownership is really making teams or responsible for the delivery of their software and their services. It can include responsibilities like incident response. By giving teams ownership over their services, you allow them to be more independent. But there are risks that come along with this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first step is creating consistent and centralized documentation specifically around services in your application. That documentation is also a way to share that expertise. The other thing to think about keeping documentation up to date is focusing on which documentation should be written by humans.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 distributed tracing can come into play. Having up to date documentation can also be quite valuable just for reducing toil. But more than that, you can also use it to automate a lot of mundane tasks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Documentation builds confidence in the developer and engineering teams. One of the most stressful moments for engineers is on call rotations. If you're going to establish service ownership, really, this is one part that you absolutely have to do right.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Oncall is often responsible for managing changes within production. There's a lot of ways that we can do incident response well or improve incident response as it exists today. Making pages more actionable, making it easier to mitigate problems. And finally, we can also just reduce the number of pages overall.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 improving on call is important, not just for the obvious reasons. But it has a cost internally as well, right? Time spent handling pages, writing post mortems, handling those interrupts, that's time that developers and engineers are not spending building new features or doing proactive optimization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service level objectives are promises that service owners make to their customers. What's important about an slos is that it's stated in a way that can be measured on relatively short timescales. How do we determine slos?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Documentation is a way of establishing ownership hands. It's critical information for folks that are on call or need to understand how a system is behaving on call. Give teams agency to make changes to improve reliability. Rolling out new tools and processes must be a bottom up thing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So with that, I wanted to thank everyone for your attention. You can find me at Dave Spoons on Twitter. I'm always excited to talk about service ownership. Thanks.
              </li>
