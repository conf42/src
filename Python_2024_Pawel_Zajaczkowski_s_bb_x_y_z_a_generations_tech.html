              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Pablo: I would like to tell you a story about generations and generational differences. In the second act, we'll move to particular generations and we'll see about those differences. A disclaimer: Most of those memes are kind of offensive. But be advised and just keep your distance or we will all die.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea of generation or demographic cohort is the ideas. When we are young, when we are up to 20 years old, the events that take place, the technology that is currently developing that we are using shapes us. Do those differences even exist? Or are they just myths?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The ages of particular generations vary depending on the source. This is more or less the consensus, but it's not always very strict. To visualize how it looks in a population, look at a population of Poland.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are myths and facts about generational differences. The perception of generation is shifting with time. Our personality has changed as we age. We shouldn't discriminate based on age or the generations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We talk a little bit about our particular generations and how to deal with them. We start with the silent generation and move on to the baby boomers. If you want to make them happy, you can put them in some formal position of power.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next generation, X generation, born after 65, currently roughly 42 to 50 air, 58 years old. Generation X tend to be very autonomous. They are prone to burnout, so be careful with them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 millennials like to know why they do things like those. Sometimes they are called 90s kids. They are more flexible than an earlier generation, more geared toward teamwork. How to deal with millennials?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Traditional Z is mostly just entering the work market, at least older of them. Generation Z is more educated than the previous generation. They are more focused on environment, more environment conscious. Some kind of gamification at work or in the recruitment process might be helpful.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Experiment with different generations. How different generations would approach being told to roll the boat. All of us need some kind of stability in the company. Different generations put emphasis on different things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
