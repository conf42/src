              <li>
                Hi there. Welcome to my session. It's good that you're watching this. It shows me that you care about more than just making software. You're also interested in the delivery part, which is, if you ask me, very crucial.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Abel Ferhover is a quality and test automation engineer at Testcoders. He says software development teams are all struggling with the same issues. These opportunities to improve typically revolve around three major areas. Ferhover: There are some opportunities for you to improve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A bug is something that we have delivered and that worked before. It's been tested, it's been through the whole software development lifecycle, and now it's not working anymore. So that's very straightforward.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are a few signals you can spot that point to a legacy system. The system outdates the current tech stack or team. If there is no testing, there's no way of learning what the system is supposed to do. Tests are a very good way to do that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 technical debt can be split up into four categories. On one hand, we have prudent actions, careful actions and careful decisions, and on the other hand we have reckless decisions. And then there's the final one, the one that you should definitely avoid. Make sure you're not in that last category.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every sprint, you put technical debt on the top of your backlog every sprint. If you fail to do that, if you just ignore your technical debt, it'll become a vicious cycle and it'll drag you down. Accept the pain.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first way of DevOps is realizing or creating flow. Work flows from left to right, from dev to ops, without having to wait a lot in between. In order to do that, you need a lot of automation. And this is something you can pick up yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Decisions need to be made on a daily basis, and sometimes they're big decisions. The bigger ones, of course, tend to take longer and require more thought. DevOps advocates that you practice data driven decision making over gut feeling.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The AHP matrix and the pew matrix are complementary to one another. The AHP metrics can be used to quantify that and find out what is most important. In the pEW matrix, we ultimately compare the final solutions that we have to pick from. You should decide with a team and have discussion on each matter.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For contract testing, you can use postman, pactflow, and pact. What we are going to do as a team is compare each attribute with the baseline with pact. You can change the math if you think that makes the decision ultimately more clear. I would love to give you more tips and tricks to lead these exercises.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make informed decisions, but stop overanalyzing. Good is good enough. I actually had to learn and understand this principles the hard way. It was about ten years ago when I was attacked by a man with a knife. It had a lot of impact after that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Not take on technical debt unless you are willing to pay back the debt. Technical debt goes to the top of the backlog. DevOps teams are typically a lot better in handling technical depth. Data driven decision making can offer you a bit more structure.
