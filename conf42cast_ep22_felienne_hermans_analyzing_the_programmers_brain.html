            var transcript = [{"body": "Hello and welcome to another episode of Conf42Cast, the podcast from the neighboring galaxy. My name is Miko Pawlikowski and today I\u0027m super excited to be hosting Felienne Hermans, an associate professor at Leiden University, Netherlands and the author of \"The Programmer\u0027s Brain\" book from Manning. Hello Felienne, how are you doing today?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:09  ", "timestamp_s": 9}, {"body": "I\u0027m good, how are you?", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "0:29  ", "timestamp_s": 29}, {"body": "I\u0027m doing great and I\u0027m really, really excited for this book. This is something that we don\u0027t get on every episode of the podcast. I was really, really happy to see that the book like this was coming up. Because this is literally the first one that I know of that is actually discussing the hardware, the human brain and how it processes it in the, you know, in the context of programming. Can you talk to me a little bit about what prompted you to write this book? What was the motivation behind?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:30  ", "timestamp_s": 30}, {"body": "Yeah, for sure. So when I graduated my PhDs, about 10 years ago now, I started to teach kids in a community center, and they wanted to learn programming. And I thought it wasn\u0027t going to be hard, because they were small kids like 10, 11 year olds. So I like, \u0027This gonna be easy, right? They\u0027re small kids, they\u0027re not going to ask me any difficult questions, because I know everything about programming. At least I will know more than they do\u0027. But it turned out to be actually really hard. They weren\u0027t learning so much. And that made me really interested in teaching and also in learning. Because clearly, it wasn\u0027t the motivation of these children, right? They came voluntarily on their free Saturday afternoons to learn. So like, this must be about me, I\u0027m not teaching in the right way. And if you want to be a better teacher, you also have to be, you also have to understand learning. So then I got into this rabbit hole of how do people learn anything? And how does that apply to learning code? So my main goal was to become a better teacher. And then on the way, I learned a lot about cognitive science and a lot of my programming too.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "0:59  ", "timestamp_s": 59}, {"body": "That is awesome. So it all started with Scratch, basically.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:59  ", "timestamp_s": 119}, {"body": "Yeah, it\u0027s been specifically also it\u0027s a transition from Scratch to text languages. So in Scratch, you don\u0027t have to know that much, right? You can sort of figure stuff out by clicking blocks together. But then once you go to a more adult language, which can sometimes be one, they want to have the real stuff, then that was really what I started to struggling. Because you need to know a lot of things like, where does the bracket go? Where does the quotation mark go? And that was really the place where kids sometimes dropped out of the class entirely, because it was too overwhelming for them.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "2:03  ", "timestamp_s": 123}, {"body": "Okay, so that makes perfect sense. And it\u0027s actually a very cool origin story. One thing that I do notice when I was reading your book is that there\u0027s actually quite a lot of good science behind a lot of this, a lot of experiments that I\u0027m hoping we can kind of go into in a minute. But I wasn\u0027t aware that our understanding of the brain was, you know, a little bit better than just guessing. And did you know that that was the case, when you started writing the book? Or did you discover that as you kind of went into other chapters?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "2:34  ", "timestamp_s": 154}, {"body": "No, I already had a basic understanding of some cognitive science. Actually, very long time ago, I think it was like 2014 or something, I already gave a talk about some of the things that ultimately ended up in the book. So I did have an understanding of what we talk about in the book as well. What is your long term memory? And what is your short term memory? And what is your working memory? Just by, you know, following the news, I had some basic understanding of how stuff was processed. And some of the experiments that I talked about in the book as well, the stuff that was closer to software engineering, this I also knew. Like stuff about, why do design patterns work? And what is the role of cognitive science there? So it wasn\u0027t that I had no understanding of any of this, would have been hard to write a book that way. So I had some basic idea of the directions I needed to go in. And then I just needed to gather everything up and put it in the book.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "3:06  ", "timestamp_s": 186}, {"body": "That makes sense. So, Felienne\u0027s book is divided into four parts. There is a part on reading code better, thinking about code, on writing code better and then collaborating on code. So, I would like to maybe give our audience a little bit of a sneak peek of one of these parts. Perhaps we could focus on the reading part, which I guess is like a starting point for everybody who actually wants to learn to code. What are the cognitive processes at work when you\u0027re actually reading code? Would you dive into that a little bit?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "3:57  ", "timestamp_s": 237}, {"body": "For sure. So, there are three different memory systems that I talked about in the book that we generally distinguish from each other. There\u0027s a long term memory that stores everything you know, and so that you have experiences in life and also for example, Syntax. So you know, if you\u0027re a Python programmer that\u0027s for i in range, open bracket for closing brackets, go long, that is a form, this is in your long term memory. There\u0027s also your short term memory and your short term memory holds information that you read very briefly. So if you\u0027re listening to this episodes, then maybe one sentence that you\u0027re listening to is in your short term memory. And then from your short term memory, your brain starts processing stuff. So maybe if you listen to my voice, you start thinking about something. This thinking is what happens in the working memory. And what is so important to note, that I talked about in my book, is that the working memory collaborates with your long term memory. So, everything you\u0027re listening to now, all the words you already know their meaning. So, the whole time that you\u0027re thinking about stuff, your long term memory, sometimes I\u0027ve described it\u0027s like an angel that\u0027s sitting on your shoulder, your long term memory is saying, \u0027Oh, I know this word. I know this concept\u0027. And sometimes random memories pop up, right? So when you\u0027re programming something, maybe you think, \u0027I solved something like this in the past, I used the HashMap then, so maybe this is a good idea now\u0027. So your long term memory is always trying to like offer you help. This is stuff you already know, maybe it is useful, sometimes isn\u0027t useful. But often it\u0027s very useful. And I think in programming generally, we very much focus on the working memory. We always talk about, you know, thinking and problem solving. So we always talk about, think about the working memory, which should be like the processor of the brain. And we tend to discount a bit the role of the long term memory, when we actively say stuff like, \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t need to know Syntax, because you can simply look up Syntax on the internet, you don\u0027t need to know anything, you don\u0027t have to have this good knowledge base\u0027. Those are things we typically say. But this isn\u0027t really true. Because your long term memory really plays a big role in everything you do. So that\u0027s one of the things I talk about in the book, in great lengths.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "4:37  ", "timestamp_s": 277}, {"body": "Yeah, that reminds me of the experiment I thought was rather elegant. And here, I\u0027m gonna attempt the pronunciation, please correct me. Adriaan de Groot.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "5:13  ", "timestamp_s": 313}, {"body": "Adriaan de Groot is what I would say my native language.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "6:46  ", "timestamp_s": 406}, {"body": "With the chess. Do you think you could talk about what he discovered with that experiment?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "7:01  ", "timestamp_s": 421}, {"body": "Absolutely, absolutely. So, Adriaan de Groot was a mathematician, actually, in the 1940s, a Dutch mathematician. And he was supposed to write a PhD thesis on Math, but he ended up writing a PhD thesis on chess. And with that, he sort of accidentally started a whole field of cognitive science. Because he wanted to know why are some people better at chess, he was also himself a good chess player. So he was curious at what makes people good at playing chess. And initially he thought that a very good memory makes people really good chess players. So he had these experiments where he showed people at chess boards, and then he showed this to not really like random people off the street, but sort of proper chess players versus chess grandmasters. And then it turned out that these grandmasters were very much better able at remembering chess setups. So he would show them a board for a few seconds, and then you would cover the board with a blanket or something, and they had to put the pieces back and experts were really good at this. So it\u0027s like, maybe these grandmasters have a superior memory, maybe they\u0027re just really good at memorization, and that is what makes them really good chess players. But then he did an interesting second experiment, where instead of having a normal chess setup, he just scrambled all the pieces. And then he did the exact same experiment, which he has average players and chess grandmasters reproduce the chess setup. And in the second experiments, both were bad and equally bad. So it wasn\u0027t like the chess grandmasters had a really good memory for everything. They didn\u0027t even have a really good memory for chess pieces. They only had a really good memory for chess setups. And the reason this is what Adriaan de Groot dove into is that the chess grandmasters weren\u0027t remembering individual pieces. They weren\u0027t thinking like, \u0027Oh, a rook at A5, a pawn at B7, because then it overflows your short term memory that we know is very, very limited. No, they weren\u0027t doing it. They were looking at chess setup and were like, \u0027Oh, this is Sicilian opening, but one rook is a bit to the left\u0027, or, \u0027Oh, this reminds me of that game that I played with Betsy on that rainy Saturday afternoon in London\u0027. So, they had a very good long term memory for chess setups. And this good long term memory was helping them in processing, remembering and thinking about chess setups. And some similar experiments, that I described in the book as well, were also done, basically the exact same experiments, for TRON codes, where experts were very much better able to remember regular programs than experts. But for scrambled programs, where all the lines were mixed, it was basically the experts and officers were basically equally bad. And this is interesting to know about programming. That\u0027s if you\u0027re an expert in a programming language, or in a domain, or in a codebase, you really see something different. I look as code in my codebase, I see the code and I immediately, I remember when I wrote it, I remember what I was thinking when I was writing it. I know all the concepts, and then I\u0027m onboarding an undergraph into my open source projects. And it\u0027s really hard to keep telling yourself, they aren\u0027t seeing the same things. Maybe they\u0027re like stuck on the first line, because it has an unfamiliar word or concept. And then the rest of the code just, if the brain is full, then no more information is going to be processed by them. So, that\u0027s really something that just might seem a bit far away from programming. But these exact same principles also holds for reading code.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "7:07  ", "timestamp_s": 427}, {"body": "Yeah. In a way that\u0027s kind of just lacking pre-loaded libraries or something.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "13:02  ", "timestamp_s": 782}, {"body": "I love that analogy. I\u0027ve never described it like that. But I\u0027m going to steal it from you. It is very much like that. It is like you\u0027re lacking a pre-loaded library. So you cannot, you cannot call that certain method, because you haven\u0027t loaded the library. I love that. Yeah, that\u0027s it. ", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "13:09  ", "timestamp_s": 789}, {"body": "All right. So, tell me about cognitive load, because this is something that now people just throw around on the internet to mean different things. But what is it really and where does it come from?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "13:23  ", "timestamp_s": 803}, {"body": "So the cognitive load is very, very closely related to the limits that we talked about, these four to six elements. More elements at the same time aren\u0027t really processable for your brain. So if you have to do too many things at the same time, then your brain gets overloaded, and then just you can do Effective Thinking anymore. And I guess this is something that programmers all recognize where you\u0027re very deep in a codebase, like, \u0027Oh, let me see, this method is coming from there. And then it initializes this class and this method, oh, and it has some database activity\u0027. And at one point, you just feel you almost like physically feel your brain, you feel that there you are reaching the limit of what you can still process. And this is maybe the moment where you start making bad decisions, because you cannot fully grasp the codes. That\u0027s the principle of cognitive loads. It was designed by a researcher called Sweller. And he described this principle, he studied also children learning Math, but adults as well, processing all sorts of topics. And it seems to be the case that this is just for everyone. Some people might be a little bit better, or a little bit worse. But there\u0027s always for people this cognitive limit, where they\u0027re holding too many things at the same time. And again, this is also very related to the long term memory and the stuff you already know. Because if you\u0027re just thinking, \u0027Oh, this is the decorator pattern, you have lots of cognitive room left. But if you\u0027re focusing at lower levels of code, at lines of code or individual variables, then your brain is a little bit more likely to get fooled very soon. So that is the principle of cognitive loads.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "13:38  ", "timestamp_s": 818}, {"body": "Thank you. Thanks for clarifying that. One other thing that I really loved about reading that first part is that I\u0027ve been meaning to do some coding during an MRI scan for myself for ages, I\u0027ve always wondered what it would actually show. So I was really relieved to see that someone has actually done that. And you\u0027re describing an experiment from, and again trying to not butcher that, \u202aJanet Siegmund about putting someone in an MRI scanning machine and making them do some Java programming. Can you describe what they found and what we can apply from that to our daily lives as programmers?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "15:15  ", "timestamp_s": 915}, {"body": "Yeah, for sure. So the sad thing about an fMRI scanner is that people can\u0027t move in the scanner, because that then destroys the scan. So the experiments that Jen Siegmund has done, she has specifically looked at people only reading code in a small screen in a fMRI scanner. So those experiments, just because of the context, are a little bit limited. There\u0027s more actually, that we described in the book, there\u0027s also very useful. There\u0027s also a device called a F-nips device, which is like a fMRI scanner, which you can wear it as a headband. And so those experiments are a little bit more closer to programmers lives, because then people can look at the IDE while they\u0027re programming. And the results so far, so it\u0027s all new, and we aren\u0027t really sure. But the stuff that seems to be the case is that your working memory is working really hard if you\u0027re programming, which of course is not a surprise. And that people with a larger working memory sometimes have a little bit easier time reading code. And there\u0027s very interesting sort of sometimes a bit conflicting results on the role of mathematical thinking and language thinking. So some of the initial results of Janet would seem to indicate, although we have to be a bit careful, as I said, because of the limited setting that language parts of the brain play a role in processing programming code, which I think is interesting. If we look at how we talk about our own field, very often we say stuff like, \u0027Oh, you know, you have to be really good at Math, to become a programmer\u0027. Computer science programs at the university typically are quite Math-heavy. And people that like languages, sometimes might not feel so at home in the computer science department, they might not think that programming career is for them. So it\u0027s very interesting from the perspective of thinking about what matters for our field, that it seems to be the case that the parts of the brain that we use for programming are also the parts of the brain that we use for processing normal natural language. Which of course isn\u0027t surprising either, because I don\u0027t remember exactly the number, but it is in the book, but something like 75% of a codebase is word, right? Variables and keywords and metanames. So yeah, it\u0027s not weird, of course, that our language brain also plays a role there.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "16:00  ", "timestamp_s": 960}, {"body": "So is that just correlation? Or does it mean that this actually not that different to learn a programming language than it is to learn, let\u0027s say, French? ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "18:18  ", "timestamp_s": 1098}, {"body": "Yeah, that\u0027s a great question. There\u0027s another paper that I talked about in the book by some researcher called Pratt. And they actually did a study in which they tried to understand, is this correlation or causation, where they trained people, non-programmers, in a language, and also in programming. And then indeed, they found a correlation, sort of a prediction. That\u0027s if you\u0027re better at learning natural language, you will also be better at learning a programming language. Again, these are all preliminary experiments. So it is a bit doubtful how strong this relationship is, and whether this will hold for all sorts of populations. But the initial results he really showed it, if you are good at learning a language you will also be better at learning a programming language, which, again, as I said, about the things we believe about our field is really interesting, because this isn\u0027t typically something we say, and people that are really good at learning languages might not feel so welcome, or might not think they will be very successful at learning a programming language.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "18:27  ", "timestamp_s": 1107}, {"body": "And speaking of hard things, you know, a lot of people say that there are only three difficult things in computer science, right? One is naming things. And the other one is one by one errors. Can you talk to me a little bit about the actual science behind why naming things is so important and so difficult at the same time? ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "23:03  ", "timestamp_s": 1383}, {"body": "Yeah, for sure. So, naming things is hard, separate from programming, right? Big parts of philosophy are about, what does this concept mean exactly and how is it different from other concepts. And that\u0027s sometimes what we\u0027re replicating in programming, you have to pick a word that\u0027s ambiguously going to say, this is the thing that we\u0027ve talked about. And it\u0027s definitely not like the other thing that\u0027s also in this codebase. So naming in general, it\u0027s very hard. But there\u0027s one resource that I talked about in the book that I really very much like, and that\u0027s about the principle called \u0027name mods\u0027. One of the things that, I have to take a step back there, one of the things that make doing stuff easier is if stuff is always in the same way. Like I put my keys next to my front door, they\u0027re always there. I don\u0027t have to think about where my keys are. I exit the house and I grab my keys, and they\u0027re always there. That is the idea behind name mods. Name mods talks about how to structure a name. So it doesn\u0027t really talk about how to name something, because that is just really hard. But something we can make easier is giving names always the same structure. So for example, you have the maximum interest rate, how do you call that? I\u0027m sure that if we would sample codebases out there, there are many different ways that people will do that. People would say, interest rate maximum or max interest rate, or maximum interest rate, or maybe maximum of interest rates. So there\u0027s all these different forms that you can use, and the idea of name mods is that in a codebase, or maybe ultimately if this catches on in a programming language, we say the way we do stuff is we first say the quantity, we first say interest rates. And then we say the quantifier, maximum, minimum, first, whatever, or the other way around, doesn\u0027t really make that much difference what you pick. But if you always pick the same thing, like with your keys next to the front door, it takes you less energy to process. And also it takes you less energy, of course, to decide what you\u0027re going to do, because you can just always pick the name mods. So there\u0027s stuff that we can\u0027t make easier. Describing a concept is really hard. But something like name mods is a relatively easy thing to do. So if you\u0027re working on a codebase, you can just have a little meeting and say, \u0027Okay, this is our name, mod\u0027. And going forward. That\u0027s what you use, that\u0027s relatively easy and cheap thing to do. And you can also just start, you don\u0027t have to necessarily refactor every name in your codebase, you can start saying from now on, if we introduce new variable names, this is the mod we use. If we see variable names that aren\u0027t in this mod, we just refactor and then we can take it slow. It costs almost nothing, and it is definitely going to help you. So that\u0027s just something, like I love this paper. Sometimes, if you\u0027re a scientist, you\u0027re like, \u0027I wish I came up with this idea. It\u0027s such a lovely and simple idea that you can explain to anyone\u0027. And it\u0027s not like you need an expensive AI tool to do anything. This is like super, super easy. So I just like want to talk about this result, because it\u0027s just an easy thing to do. And it\u0027s such a lovely, cute idea. I love this paper.", "speaker": "Felienne Hermans", "timestamp": "23:28  ", "timestamp_s": 1408}, {"body": "It certainly does. And I can definitely relate to the feeling of oh, for once I put my keys somewhere else. And now I have a mini heart attack, because it doesn\u0027t compute. That\u0027s just scary. I love it.

My name is Miko Pawlikowski and today I'm super excited to be hosting Felienne Hermans, an associate professor at Leiden University, Netherlands and the author of "The Programmer's Brain" book from Manning. Hello Felienne, how are you doing today?</p>

            

            <p id="29">

            <p id="body-29" class="transcript-paragraph">I'm good, how are you?</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-30" class="transcript-paragraph">I'm doing great and I'm really, really excited for this book. This is something that we don't get on every episode of the podcast. I was really, really happy to see that the book like this was coming up. Because this is literally the first one that I know of that is actually discussing the hardware, the human brain and how it processes it in the, you know, in the context of programming. Can you talk to me a little bit about what prompted you to write this book? What was the motivation behind?</p>

            

            <p id="59">
              <a href="#59" onclick="seek(59);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 0:59  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-59" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, for sure. So when I graduated my PhDs, about 10 years ago now, I started to teach kids in a community center, and they wanted to learn programming. And I thought it wasn't going to be hard, because they were small kids like 10, 11 year olds. So I like, 'This gonna be easy, right? They're small kids, they're not going to ask me any difficult questions, because I know everything about programming. At least I will know more than they do'. But it turned out to be actually really hard. They weren't learning so much. And that made me really interested in teaching and also in learning. Because clearly, it wasn't the motivation of these children, right? They came voluntarily on their free Saturday afternoons to learn. So like, this must be about me, I'm not teaching in the right way. And if you want to be a better teacher, you also have to be, you also have to understand learning. So then I got into this rabbit hole of how do people learn anything? And how does that apply to learning code? So my main goal was to become a better teacher. And then on the way, I learned a lot about cognitive science and a lot of my programming too.</p>

            

            <p id="119">

            </p>
            <p id="body-119" class="transcript-paragraph">That is awesome. So it all started with Scratch, basically.</p>

            

            <p id="123">
              <a href="#123" onclick="seek(123);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 2:03  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-123" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, it's been specifically also it's a transition from Scratch to text languages. So in Scratch, you don't have to know that much, right? You can sort of figure stuff out by clicking blocks together. But then once you go to a more adult language, which can sometimes be one, they want to have the real stuff, then that was really what I started to struggling. Because you need to know a lot of things like, where does the bracket go? Where does the quotation mark go? And that was really the place where kids sometimes dropped out of the class entirely, because it was too overwhelming for them.</p>

            

            <p id="154">

              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-154" class="transcript-paragraph">Okay, so that makes perfect sense. And it's actually a very cool origin story. One thing that I do notice when I was reading your book is that there's actually quite a lot of good science behind a lot of this, a lot of experiments that I'm hoping we can kind of go into in a minute. But I wasn't aware that our understanding of the brain was, you know, a little bit better than just guessing. And did you know that that was the case, when you started writing the book? Or did you discover that as you kind of went into other chapters?</p>

            

            <p id="186">
              <a href="#186" onclick="seek(186);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 3:06  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-186" class="transcript-paragraph">No, I already had a basic understanding of some cognitive science. Actually, very long time ago, I think it was like 2014 or something, I already gave a talk about some of the things that ultimately ended up in the book. So I did have an understanding of what we talk about in the book as well. What is your long term memory? And what is your short term memory? And what is your working memory? Just by, you know, following the news, I had some basic understanding of how stuff was processed. And some of the experiments that I talked about in the book as well, the stuff that was closer to software engineering, this I also knew. Like stuff about, why do design patterns work? And what is the role of cognitive science there? So it wasn't that I had no understanding of any of this, would have been hard to write a book that way. So I had some basic idea of the directions I needed to go in. And then I just needed to gather everything up and put it in the book.</p>

            

            <p id="237">
              <a href="#237" onclick="seek(237);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 3:57  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-237" class="transcript-paragraph">That makes sense. So, Felienne's book is divided into four parts. There is a part on reading code better, thinking about code, on writing code better and then collaborating on code. So, I would like to maybe give our audience a little bit of a sneak peek of one of these parts. Perhaps we could focus on the reading part, which I guess is like a starting point for everybody who actually wants to learn to code. What are the cognitive processes at work when you're actually reading code? Would you dive into that a little bit?</p>

            

            <p id="277">
              <a href="#277" onclick="seek(277);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 4:37  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-277" class="transcript-paragraph">For sure. So, there are three different memory systems that I talked about in the book that we generally distinguish from each other. There's a long term memory that stores everything you know, and so that you have experiences in life and also for example, Syntax. So you know, if you're a Python programmer that's for i in range, open bracket for closing brackets, go long, that is a form, this is in your long term memory. There's also your short term memory and your short term memory holds information that you read very briefly. So if you're listening to this episodes, then maybe one sentence that you're listening to is in your short term memory. And then from your short term memory, your brain starts processing stuff. So maybe if you listen to my voice, you start thinking about something. This thinking is what happens in the working memory. And what is so important to note, that I talked about in my book, is that the working memory collaborates with your long term memory. So, everything you're listening to now, all the words you already know their meaning. So, the whole time that you're thinking about stuff, your long term memory, sometimes I've described it's like an angel that's sitting on your shoulder, your long term memory is saying, 'Oh, I know this word. I know this concept'. And sometimes random memories pop up, right? So when you're programming something, maybe you think, 'I solved something like this in the past, I used the HashMap then, so maybe this is a good idea now'. So your long term memory is always trying to like offer you help. This is stuff you already know, maybe it is useful, sometimes isn't useful. But often it's very useful. And I think in programming generally, we very much focus on the working memory. We always talk about, you know, thinking and problem solving. So we always talk about, think about the working memory, which should be like the processor of the brain. And we tend to discount a bit the role of the long term memory, when we actively say stuff like, 'Oh, you don't need to know Syntax, because you can simply look up Syntax on the internet, you don't need to know anything, you don't have to have this good knowledge base'. Those are things we typically say. But this isn't really true. Because your long term memory really plays a big role in everything you do. So that's one of the things I talk about in the book, in great lengths.</p>

            <p id="body-421" class="transcript-paragraph">With the chess. Do you think you could talk about what he discovered with that experiment?</p>

            

            <p id="427">
              <a href="#427" onclick="seek(427);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 7:07  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-427" class="transcript-paragraph">Absolutely, absolutely. So, Adriaan de Groot was a mathematician, actually, in the 1940s, a Dutch mathematician. And he was supposed to write a PhD thesis on Math, but he ended up writing a PhD thesis on chess. And with that, he sort of accidentally started a whole field of cognitive science. Because he wanted to know why are some people better at chess, he was also himself a good chess player. So he was curious at what makes people good at playing chess. And initially he thought that a very good memory makes people really good chess players. So he had these experiments where he showed people at chess boards, and then he showed this to not really like random people off the street, but sort of proper chess players versus chess grandmasters. And then it turned out that these grandmasters were very much better able at remembering chess setups. So he would show them a board for a few seconds, and then you would cover the board with a blanket or something, and they had to put the pieces back and experts were really good at this. So it's like, maybe these grandmasters have a superior memory, maybe they're just really good at memorization, and that is what makes them really good chess players. But then he did an interesting second experiment, where instead of having a normal chess setup, he just scrambled all the pieces. And then he did the exact same experiment, which he has average players and chess grandmasters reproduce the chess setup. And in the second experiments, both were bad and equally bad. So it wasn't like the chess grandmasters had a really good memory for everything. They didn't even have a really good memory for chess pieces. They only had a really good memory for chess setups. And the reason this is what Adriaan de Groot dove into is that the chess grandmasters weren't remembering individual pieces. They weren't thinking like, 'Oh, a rook at A5, a pawn at B7, because then it overflows your short term memory that we know is very, very limited. No, they weren't doing it. They were looking at chess setup and were like, 'Oh, this is Sicilian opening, but one rook is a bit to the left', or, 'Oh, this reminds me of that game that I played with Betsy on that rainy Saturday afternoon in London'. So, they had a very good long term memory for chess setups. And this good long term memory was helping them in processing, remembering and thinking about chess setups. And some similar experiments, that I described in the book as well, were also done, basically the exact same experiments, for TRON codes, where experts were very much better able to remember regular programs than experts. But for scrambled programs, where all the lines were mixed, it was basically the experts and officers were basically equally bad. And this is interesting to know about programming. That's if you're an expert in a programming language, or in a domain, or in a codebase, you really see something different. I look as code in my codebase, I see the code and I immediately, I remember when I wrote it, I remember what I was thinking when I was writing it. I know all the concepts, and then I'm onboarding an undergraph into my open source projects. And it's really hard to keep telling yourself, they aren't seeing the same things. Maybe they're like stuck on the first line, because it has an unfamiliar word or concept. And then the rest of the code just, if the brain is full, then no more information is going to be processed by them. So, that's really something that just might seem a bit far away from programming. But these exact same principles also holds for reading code.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-782" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah. In a way that's kind of just lacking pre-loaded libraries or something.</p>

            <p id="body-789" class="transcript-paragraph">I love that analogy. I've never described it like that. But I'm going to steal it from you. It is very much like that. It is like you're lacking a pre-loaded library. So you cannot, you cannot call that certain method, because you haven't loaded the library. I love that. Yeah, that's it. </p>

            

            <p id="803">
              <a href="#803" onclick="seek(803);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 13:23  </a>
              Miko Pawlikowski
            </p>
            <p id="body-803" class="transcript-paragraph">All right. So, tell me about cognitive load, because this is something that now people just throw around on the internet to mean different things. But what is it really and where does it come from?</p>

            

            <p id="818">
              <a href="#818" onclick="seek(818);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 13:38  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-818" class="transcript-paragraph">So the cognitive load is very, very closely related to the limits that we talked about, these four to six elements. More elements at the same time aren't really processable for your brain. So if you have to do too many things at the same time, then your brain gets overloaded, and then just you can do Effective Thinking anymore. And I guess this is something that programmers all recognize where you're very deep in a codebase, like, 'Oh, let me see, this method is coming from there. And then it initializes this class and this method, oh, and it has some database activity'. And at one point, you just feel you almost like physically feel your brain, you feel that there you are reaching the limit of what you can still process. And this is maybe the moment where you start making bad decisions, because you cannot fully grasp the codes. That's the principle of cognitive loads. It was designed by a researcher called Sweller. And he described this principle, he studied also children learning Math, but adults as well, processing all sorts of topics. And it seems to be the case that this is just for everyone. Some people might be a little bit better, or a little bit worse. But there's always for people this cognitive limit, where they're holding too many things at the same time. And again, this is also very related to the long term memory and the stuff you already know. Because if you're just thinking, 'Oh, this is the decorator pattern, you have lots of cognitive room left. But if you're focusing at lower levels of code, at lines of code or individual variables, then your brain is a little bit more likely to get fooled very soon. So that is the principle of cognitive loads.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-915" class="transcript-paragraph">Thank you. Thanks for clarifying that. One other thing that I really loved about reading that first part is that I've been meaning to do some coding during an MRI scan for myself for ages, I've always wondered what it would actually show. So I was really relieved to see that someone has actually done that. And you're describing an experiment from, and again trying to not butcher that, ‪Janet Siegmund about putting someone in an MRI scanning machine and making them do some Java programming. Can you describe what they found and what we can apply from that to our daily lives as programmers?</p>

            

            <p id="960">
              <a href="#960" onclick="seek(960);"><i class="fe fe-play"></i> 16:00  </a>
              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-960" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, for sure. So the sad thing about an fMRI scanner is that people can't move in the scanner, because that then destroys the scan. So the experiments that Jen Siegmund has done, she has specifically looked at people only reading code in a small screen in a fMRI scanner. So those experiments, just because of the context, are a little bit limited. There's more actually, that we described in the book, there's also very useful. There's also a device called a F-nips device, which is like a fMRI scanner, which you can wear it as a headband. And so those experiments are a little bit more closer to programmers lives, because then people can look at the IDE while they're programming. And the results so far, so it's all new, and we aren't really sure. But the stuff that seems to be the case is that your working memory is working really hard if you're programming, which of course is not a surprise. And that people with a larger working memory sometimes have a little bit easier time reading code. And there's very interesting sort of sometimes a bit conflicting results on the role of mathematical thinking and language thinking. So some of the initial results of Janet would seem to indicate, although we have to be a bit careful, as I said, because of the limited setting that language parts of the brain play a role in processing programming code, which I think is interesting. If we look at how we talk about our own field, very often we say stuff like, 'Oh, you know, you have to be really good at Math, to become a programmer'. Computer science programs at the university typically are quite Math-heavy. And people that like languages, sometimes might not feel so at home in the computer science department, they might not think that programming career is for them. So it's very interesting from the perspective of thinking about what matters for our field, that it seems to be the case that the parts of the brain that we use for programming are also the parts of the brain that we use for processing normal natural language. Which of course isn't surprising either, because I don't remember exactly the number, but it is in the book, but something like 75% of a codebase is word, right? Variables and keywords and metanames. So yeah, it's not weird, of course, that our language brain also plays a role there.</p>

            <p id="body-1098" class="transcript-paragraph">So is that just correlation? Or does it mean that this actually not that different to learn a programming language than it is to learn, let's say, French? </p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1107" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, that's a great question. There's another paper that I talked about in the book by some researcher called Pratt. And they actually did a study in which they tried to understand, is this correlation or causation, where they trained people, non-programmers, in a language, and also in programming. And then indeed, they found a correlation, sort of a prediction. That's if you're better at learning natural language, you will also be better at learning a programming language. Again, these are all preliminary experiments. So it is a bit doubtful how strong this relationship is, and whether this will hold for all sorts of populations. But the initial results he really showed it, if you are good at learning a language you will also be better at learning a programming language, which, again, as I said, about the things we believe about our field is really interesting, because this isn't typically something we say, and people that are really good at learning languages might not feel so welcome, or might not think they will be very successful at learning a programming language.</p>

            <p id="body-1383" class="transcript-paragraph">And speaking of hard things, you know, a lot of people say that there are only three difficult things in computer science, right? One is naming things. And the other one is one by one errors. Can you talk to me a little bit about the actual science behind why naming things is so important and so difficult at the same time? </p>

            

            <p id="1408">

              Felienne Hermans
            </p>
            <p id="body-1408" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, for sure. So, naming things is hard, separate from programming, right? Big parts of philosophy are about, what does this concept mean exactly and how is it different from other concepts. And that's sometimes what we're replicating in programming, you have to pick a word that's ambiguously going to say, this is the thing that we've talked about. And it's definitely not like the other thing that's also in this codebase. So naming in general, it's very hard. But there's one resource that I talked about in the book that I really very much like, and that's about the principle called 'name mods'. One of the things that, I have to take a step back there, one of the things that make doing stuff easier is if stuff is always in the same way. Like I put my keys next to my front door, they're always there. I don't have to think about where my keys are. I exit the house and I grab my keys, and they're always there. That is the idea behind name mods. Name mods talks about how to structure a name. So it doesn't really talk about how to name something, because that is just really hard. But something we can make easier is giving names always the same structure. So for example, you have the maximum interest rate, how do you call that? I'm sure that if we would sample codebases out there, there are many different ways that people will do that. People would say, interest rate maximum or max interest rate, or maximum interest rate, or maybe maximum of interest rates. So there's all these different forms that you can use, and the idea of name mods is that in a codebase, or maybe ultimately if this catches on in a programming language, we say the way we do stuff is we first say the quantity, we first say interest rates. And then we say the quantifier, maximum, minimum, first, whatever, or the other way around, doesn't really make that much difference what you pick. But if you always pick the same thing, like with your keys next to the front door, it takes you less energy to process. And also it takes you less energy, of course, to decide what you're going to do, because you can just always pick the name mods. So there's stuff that we can't make easier. Describing a concept is really hard. But something like name mods is a relatively easy thing to do. So if you're working on a codebase, you can just have a little meeting and say, 'Okay, this is our name, mod'. And going forward. That's what you use, that's relatively easy and cheap thing to do. And you can also just start, you don't have to necessarily refactor every name in your codebase, you can start saying from now on, if we introduce new variable names, this is the mod we use. If we see variable names that aren't in this mod, we just refactor and then we can take it slow. It costs almost nothing, and it is definitely going to help you. So that's just something, like I love this paper. Sometimes, if you're a scientist, you're like, 'I wish I came up with this idea. It's such a lovely and simple idea that you can explain to anyone'. And it's not like you need an expensive AI tool to do anything. This is like super, super easy. So I just like want to talk about this result, because it's just an easy thing to do. And it's such a lovely, cute idea. I love this paper.</p>

            <p id="body-1593" class="transcript-paragraph">It certainly does. And I can definitely relate to the feeling of oh, for once I put my keys somewhere else. And now I have a mini heart attack, because it doesn't compute. That's just scary. I love it. I basically loved pretty much every minute I spent reading your book. For everybody else. This is just a small portion of the goodies that you find in Felienne's book. Other things, like actually writing the code, code smells and the cognition effects on that, patterns, anti-patterns. In general getting better at solving problems, you're going to find plenty of more science-backed evidence for this things in the book. The book is available from Manning. You can go to money.com/books/the-programmers-brain or go for Amazon. The book is already available in print, and it will shortly be available as a digital version on Amazon. And can you tell us Felienne, where to find you with any questions or just to chat about amazing things in your book?</p>

So if you know how to spell my first name, then it's easy to find me on Twitter and I guess you could put a link to my Twitter as well in the show notes. And my website is similarly easy. It's just my first name.com, where I sometimes blog about research and papers and stuff. Well, usually I blog if I go to conferences, so it has been silent for a while. </p>
