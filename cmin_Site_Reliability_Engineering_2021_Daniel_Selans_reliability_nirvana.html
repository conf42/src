              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Dan will talk to you about how to achieve reliability nirvana by utilizing event driven design. Everything that I talk about I have done in production, none of this is theoretical. My personal goal for this talk is that I just want you to walk away having learned something.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Dan: I love building and operating distributed systems. Most recently, I co founded a company called Batch. We focus on providing observability for data that is usually found on high throughput systems such as Kafka or RabbitmQ. Originally from Latvia.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to have predictable service failure scenarios. We also want some sort of self healing at the service level. But if you want to go a little bit higher, it gets exponentially harder. It's akin to moving from vms over to containers for the first time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Wikipedia defines event driven as software and systems architecture paradigm. It promotes the production, detection, consumption and reaction to events. The event bus of my choice would be Rabbit MQ 100% of the time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The fact that you are no longer relying on any other services around you. There is a single service that only cares about itself. That means that your failure domain is really small. Well defined development workflow. Security is going to be super happy about it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The most important one by far is having some sort of an event archiving solution. It is absolutely amazing to implement an event driven platform, but only if you have a complete understanding of everything. Do not try to do it in one big fell swoop.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sre is 100% event driven. The only folks that truly understand things, how they work at a platform level are sres. You absolutely must have a written culture in place with an event driven system. Everything should be written down. Security will totally thank you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You should totally start off with Martin Fowler's event driven. This article talks about the fact that event driven actually contains multiple different architectures. It's just a good overview really of event driven in general. But to get there you should probably spend a little bit more research and reading on this topic.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Do not rely on ordering. Create your system so that order doesn't really matter. That's like where item potency comes into play. High throughput observability is not really a thing yet. If you are thinking about going to event driven, come talk to me.
              </li>
