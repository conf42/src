<p>25 years after Agent Smith coined &ldquo;Never send a human to do a machine&rsquo;s job&rdquo;, this futuristic idea seems closer than ever. Join us as we discover how AI agents are becoming the &ldquo;jack-of-all-trades&rdquo; in the tech world, revolutionizing the way we work and interact with technology.</p>

                Today we are going to talk about the rise of AI agents. AI agents are really at the edge of large language models and AI these days. This topic is very open yet, and there are more questions than answers. Still, I hope that you will enjoy this talk and learn something new.

              <li>
                In 2022, OpenAI releases chat GPT to the public. For the first time, we see that these models can. show signals that they understand language. While it feels like you are talking to a very intelligible intelligent person, sometimes these errors are childlike.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AI agents are LLMs set up to run iteratively with some tools, skills and goals or tasks defined. A good example for an AI agent is for a travel agency. If we could give them the ability to plan and use tools, maybe we could get better results.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The most interesting part about agents planning is the way that we take a task and break it into sub tasks. Chain of thoughts, self critiques, reflection, all of these aspects make up for our ability to take a big task that is pretty unknown, how to solve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AI agents will serve us, will help us do things, but not in this dystopic manner. The world of AI agents is taking a lot of inspiration from humans. It will take a few years before we can master this actual, actual application of AI Agents.
