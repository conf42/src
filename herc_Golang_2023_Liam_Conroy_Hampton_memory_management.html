            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to be focusing on memory management in go. Going to look at a few code examples, some good and some bad, and help explain them. Also looking at some memorymanagement in some other languages, namely Java, Python, and some rust. Also going to throw in a live demo at the end.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Memory management is a way of keeping track of memory locations in your program and on your system. It helps to prevent memory leaks, stop security vulnerabilities appearing, and to stop the slowdown of your system and programs from running. Understanding how to manage memory is really important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Go is a lightweight execution thread. It helps to create parallelism, and it helps have asynchronous running of your code. How do you manage memory in go? There are two ways to do that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A memory leak is typically when you have a memory allocation that is referenced but it's no longer needed and it's not freed up. This can eventually cause your program to crash or slow down your system significantly. How can you personally help as a developer?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next one, garbage collector. We are declaring a global variable of data. Once it's completed, and once it's finished, we have still got a problem because that global variable is still there. How do you fix it? Well, we reduce the recursive call number.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is absolutely no guarantee that task one will finish before task two. Perfect example of a go routine and parallel execution. Let's have a look at how you can dictate and manage memory in your program.

              </li>

                Rust uses ownership and borrowing, a completely different approach to how go works with memory. Python's somewhat similar. It uses a garbage collector, and it uses a technique called reference counting. What are my top tips for effective memory management?

              <li>
                In vs code, we can see how much memory is being used in our programs. We can see leaky function right at the top with a use rate of 91%. And of course we could see a lot more of it.
