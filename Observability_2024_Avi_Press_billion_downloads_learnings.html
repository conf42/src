                Scarf provides usage metrics, marketing and sales intelligence for commercial open source businesses. The data comes from the distribution of about 2500 software, open source packages. We'll talk about the trends that we see in the data and then what we can learn from it and why you should care.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most governments around the world also use open source. 1.2 million businesses in the data also represents 95% of the Fortune 500. Most largest companies in the world are leveraging open source in terms of the public cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of the downloads that you may have as an open source maintainer, they come from totally automated systems. One really standout piece of software is Pip, the Python package manager. We'd love to see more programs include this kind of very rich information in their user agents.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most users will never download a second version once they get one. If you want to see fewer companies ditch open source licenses, the trend that we see is that you have all these companies that they kind of hit a wall with how much they can grow. Better analytics and better data, better observability, is crucial.
