              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                In my session I'll be talking about improving observability when you're running your workloads on AWS. We will also touch upon some of the SRE practices like slis, slos and slas. You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As we are trying to develop more and more applications in a distributed ecosystem, observability has suddenly become a very important aspect of all these applications. Observability is a correlation of all the different signals that you would implement if you are running applications. There are many different ways of improving your system's observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The logs can be split into four different categories. Application logs, system logs, audit logs, and infrastructure logs. A consistent logging format will help you ease that entire process of extracting information from the logs. Too much logging can also result in performance issues.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The third signal that we have spoken about in the previous slide is tracing. Distributed tracing has become increasingly important when you are running your system in a distributed environment. It gives you information of all the lag or the latency that you are having at different levels of your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Cloudwatch will take care of your metrics and your logs, and AWS Xray provides you the tracing capability. This will also give you a service map and it helps the developers to analyze and debug their production workloads, especially in a distributed environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Cloudwatch is responsible for getting all these metrics put together. If a metric is exceeding or going beyond a specific threshold that you would have set, you can have a Cloudwatch alarm go off. You can also have auto scaling being invoked. As a consumer you can plot the graphs which we will have a look at in the next slide.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aws well, now let's look at log insights. This is a query which is being executed on Cloudwatch logs itself. It helps you parse certain parts of that particular log format and filter all the logs. And after that you can show the distribution of the log events over time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So with the logs in place, let's talk about the metrics. These metrics are being grouped by namespace and then by the various dimensions which are associated with that. Next we have the graphed metrics. It's very related to the metrics that you saw in the earlier slide.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are basically two types of alarms. One would be the basic metric alarms and others are composite alarms. The alarms can be put to work together with the metrics that you are collecting to give you this experience of either sending out SNS notification or maybe even doing automated remediation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Cloudwatch can help you take care of your logging as well as your metric needs. And now we have a look at AWS X ray with AWS Xray. It helps you determine how your service is operating and also gives you a one shot view of how different services are integrated.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The importance of service level indicators, objective and agreement. Make sure these are incorporated in your sare practice. Not meeting a particular SLA or meeting an SLA determines the success or failure of a service. Some of the guidance which you can follow.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make sure you implement the SLIs, SLOs and SLAs for your application in consultation with the stakeholders. If you're running your services on AWS, try and leverage the native tooling that is already available. Hop over to observability workshop AWS and get a hands on experience of all the features which are there.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
