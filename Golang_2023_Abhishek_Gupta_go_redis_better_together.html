              <li>
                Abhishek Gupta is a developer advocate at AWS. databases go and open source in general are his focus areas. Don't hesitate to connect with him if you have questions or just want to chat about tech in general.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This talk is geared towards folks who are looking to get started with Redis and go. In many ways, so far, I've seen that Go has become this lingua franca, or language of the cloud. Hopefully some of the tips and tricks will help you simplify that learning curve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Redis and go have a few things in common. One of the things which really, really stands out to me is the simplicity. The goal is to give you simple components to help build complex things and hide the complexity of the language itself behind a simple facade.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Redis is nothing but a key value store, where the key can be a string, or even a binary. Redis is primarily an in memory system, but you can configure it to be persistent or rather persist that data to disk as well. You can get offerings from pretty much any cloud provider, big or small.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The common one is string, which can be used for something as simple as storing a key value pair. sorted sets are like this big brother to set, and they make it possible for you to implement things like leaderboard. Redis just feels like an extension with all these data structures.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To build something useful you need to have clients. Redis has a very, very rich ecosystem of clients. Goredis is by far the most popular client out there. I'll be using this client for most part of this presentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Readygo is a fairly stable, fairly tenured client in the go ecosystem. But the API for this particular client is a bit too flexible, at least in my personal opinion. And then there is another client called Ruidus. In terms of the ecosystem and where go stands, as of now, it's very close to the redis and Java client.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Redis can be used to connect to a local redis server. You can also set a TTL or expiry. Here we take a look at how to work with strings. Keep this fairly high level and fairly quick.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 edge set is actually very flexible. It can take key value pairs like what you can see here. Can take a string slice, it can take a map built. Can actually take in a struct as an input as well. This is a MUch easier, simpler, and a natural way of representing your objects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using an s add function to add a bunch of tags to a set. If I want to check, hey, is this sre tag included for conf fourty two? And in this case it's not. So sets very, again very simple to work with conceptually from a client library as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pipeline is one of my other favorites in addition to sharded pub sub and few others. Think of it as batching. You can send a bunch of commands in one go, and you can get the response in a single request. I would encourage you to actually try it out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's this data structure called hyper log, and it's this sets on steroids. It can store a lot of data, much, much more than set. Run this for yourself and see the kind of memory usage which you notice in your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A use case around worker queues and how they make that possible. Start a redis server and a mock SMTP server. These worker instances are going to distribute the tasks of sending emails amongst themselves. This can be used in many use cases.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use real time technology called websocket to create much, much more powerful solutions. Show us an application of the pub sub capabilities. Pub sub is about broadcasting messages to a channel. Users subscribe to that channel and receive messages. Use combination of WebSocket and redis pops up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The connection mode that you use in your client application will depend on whether you're using a standalone redis setup or a redis cluster. If you don't use the right mode of connection, obviously you'll get an error. Make sure that you have the right configuration in terms of the VPC and the security groups.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can either scale redis up or out, right? Up, down and in and out. But you need to put a lot of thought into scaling out horizontally. You should opt for a redis cluster based setup instead. And once you have scaled out, don't forget to make use of those replicas.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sharded pub sub was introduced in redis seven. It helps scale your traditional pub sub even further. It's very similar to the original subscribe and publish methods or functions. Something to be mindful of and make sure that you're using the sharding pub sub in your Redis cluster topology.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Here are a few resources which you might find interesting. A link to the GitHub repo for the redis client as well as the Discord channel where you can interact with the core maintainers. If you want to build practical solutions or try out advanced use cases, give it a go.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                All right, that's that. I would love to have your feedback. All you need to do is take out your phone, scan this QR code, or you can use the link directly here. Once you finish submitting your feedback, you should get a download link to this presentation as well.
