              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today's first question is, how did you learn how to cook? Are you someone that had to learn by watching others cook? There's no right or wrong answer. Everyone learns differently. What are those learning methods that we use in the kitchen that we can apply to building reliable, complex applications and systems?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is the best way that you learn? Are you someone that needs a very specific set of methods in order to pick up a concept? For me, my favorite way was building and breaking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For me to learn and have growth in this cooking space, I have to cook for others. I love tasting the plates as I go. This is something very similar to what we do in building our applications. There's a lot of beauty in cooking, and that is because we can learn.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Ana margarita Medina is senior chaos engineer at Gremlin. Medina was born and raised in Costa Rica and her parents are from Nicaragua. One of the things that really, really matters to her is representation in tech.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To bring it back to today's focus, we're going to be talking about learning. What are those things that we can do every single day in order to push ourselves past our comfort zone and take a step into learning?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The world that we're building relies more and more on the stability of naturally brittle technology. When we are not able to have applications and systems that are up, we suffer downtime. With this current complexity of our systems, we really, really need experimentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 chaos engineering is thoughtful, planned experiments designed to reveal the weakness in our systems. The purpose is not just for breaking things. We do this with the purpose of breaking things on purpose, to learn from those failure points and improve our applications.

              </li>

                The scientific method involves observing your system and baselining your metrics. Abort conditions are those conditions that can happen to your systems or things that you might see in the monitoring or user experience. This last step is one of the most important steps in chaos engineering, and that is sharing the results.

                I did want to go over some chaos engineering experiments that we can kind of create. On Kubernetes, resource limits are in order for you to make sure that things are scaling properly. With these type of experiments we get a chance to inject latency, block off traffic. If you're interested in learning the effects about this experiment, come to one of my boot camps.

              <li>
                When we're talking about cloud native applications, we have to make sure that we're ready for failure. Practice is one of these key terms in building resilient applications. If you do perform some chaos engineering experiments, you get a chance to understand the failures. And continuously improve on those issues.
