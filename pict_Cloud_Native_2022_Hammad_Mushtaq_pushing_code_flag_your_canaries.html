    <meta property="og:description" content="Reliability is multifaceted. Your approach to releases plays a part in that. It's smart to think forward. What's impacted? What will change? Canary releases, or phased rollouts, allows you to better manage the release lifecycle and understand any impact to reliability. Iteration and canarying is more involved than traditional big releases. You need to look at the code being deployed and flag everything that comprises each new feature. You’ll also need to tag groups of users. And instead of one big release, you do several smaller releases where more groups of users receive more features each time.   In this talk you'll learn:  - Why you should consider an iterative canarying approach to releases - Knowing when it’s safe to expand and iterate  - Understanding how users rely on your services to find the ideal groups to canary  Your reliability plan should comprise these parts. Learn the agile way."/>

<p>Reliability is multifaceted. Your approach to releases plays a part in that. It&rsquo;s smart to think forward. What&rsquo;s impacted? What will change? Canary releases, or phased rollouts, allows you to better manage the release lifecycle and understand any impact to reliability. Iteration and canarying is more involved than traditional big releases. You need to look at the code being deployed and flag everything that comprises each new feature. You’ll also need to tag groups of users. And instead of one big release, you do several smaller releases where more groups of users receive more features each time. </p>
<p>In this talk you&rsquo;ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why you should consider an iterative canarying approach to releases</li>
<li>Knowing when it’s safe to expand and iterate </li>
<li>Understanding how users rely on your services to find the ideal groups to canary</li>
</ul>
<p>Your reliability plan should comprise these parts. Learn the agile way.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today's talk is titled Pushing Code. In this talk we'll cover a variety of topics. We'll go into reliability, how it's most importantly about the user. At the end we'll have a quick question and answer session. Don't forget to flag your canaries.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Reliability is feature number one. It doesn't matter what shiny new feature you put into your application. As you grow into a bigger company, that reliability becomes more and more important. The practice of SRE is about bridging the gap between the dev side of things and the operational side.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How likely the login is to succeed is extremely important to the success of your application. It annoys the user when something is slow. What really matters to the overall experience of your customer is how slow is it over a period of time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In software development, canary means releasing to a set of users over time until you've rolled out a feature to all customers. Why do we do this? One, there's less impacted liability. Two, continuous feedback from various users that you're rolling out to.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The difference in canary releases is that the deploy step is really broken up into multiple steps. So really you take every feature and repeat this process multiple times for every set of customers. And the fact that you're releasing it to small system users, meaning that your monitoring and fixes are less urgent.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For feature A, you're going to offset feature B, release it, and these do the same process as feature B independently. How does that work in a timeline or chronological fashion?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 feature flags allow us to inform timing, stability and the go forward strategy. You can proactively monitor what got pushed because you can see when the feature flag was enabled and then who it got pushed to. Once everything is stable and you fix the any issues you've identified, you roll out to other users.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The best group to target is the ones that are already using youll product area or have specifically asked for a feature set. A Canary deployment is the lowest risk prone compared to all these deployment strategies because of the level of control.
