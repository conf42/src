    <meta property="og:description" content="Being on-call is stressful. Stress impacts our brain and the way we think, making decision-making harder, but resolving incidents relies on making good decisions quickly! This talk looks at a more scientific-based approach to incident decision making using Karl Popperâ€™s theory of falsifiability."/>

              <li>
                Ivan Merrill: This talk is an evolution, really, of my thinking around incidents. Having spent 15 years in the financial sector, working primarily in kind of monitoring and observability. Add in some research that other people have undertaken to help you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The tech industry is still pretty young. Incident response can learn a lot from safety engineering in other domains. Too often it can descend into chaos. Let's make sure that we can take these ideas into the tech industry.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Incidents are a set of activities bounded in time that are related to an undesirable system behavior. One of the hallmarks of a complex system is the potential for a catastrophic outcome. And the fact is that incidents aren't actually very easy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An over reliance on dashboards and runbooks can lead to low meantime to innocence for every team. Spending a long time on the wrong hypothesis is a massive time sink and can be costly for organizations. Fear of failure is a big thing and it's really important during incidents.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And so it's really important that we learn and we improve with every incident that we have. But there are some pitfalls that we can fall into here, too. We need to record the context of why decisions were made.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The complex system isn't just the technology, right? It's actually everything involved, and that's the humans as well. As we introduce change, we introduce new forms of failure. The next failure is likely to be even more catastrophic.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A more scientificbased scientific approach to how humans perform and document incident investigations can improve reliability. We can apply Karl Popper's theory of false viability to creating hypotheses within incidents. But transferring this experience is really, really hard in most cases in many companies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Think of lots and lots of different hypotheses. Keep it high level, though, and don't go too deep. Try and disprove as many of these as possible. Simplest is often the most common. All practitioner acts are a gamble. But hopefully by introducing more scientific method, by recording our actions, we can reduce this gamble.
