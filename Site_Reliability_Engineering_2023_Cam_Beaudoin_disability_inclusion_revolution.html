                Cambodwai: Today we're going to be talking about how to build a sustainable accessibility program without wasting a ton of time and money. He says self consciousness keeps us from asking the right questions and creating an unconscious bias and exclusions towards people with disabilities.

              <li>
                A proper accessibility program is the key to being a differentiator in your market. I'm going to show you how we can do that with a framework that will make it straightforward and simple to understand. Normalize it speaks to the business of disability, inclusion and accessibility.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you're going to apply accessibility inside your organization, you need to know your current situation. What are the laws and regulatory considerations for your projects? Identify DEi initiatives. Next up, having an assessment, a maturity model assessment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In 2008, Target received a class action lawsuit because blind users couldn't use screen reader technology. They built an accessibility program. Without this plan, none of this would have worked. A culture of dignity and delight keeps your best talent and employees and clients.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Accessibility can usually and often think of this as this ambiguous, amorphous, nebulous target. Building internal knowledge bases involving people with disabilities to get their proper feedback on the products that you're building. Organizations are paying attention to this. What are organizations doing to be a part of the future prosperity?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The US Office of Disabilities Employment Policy categorizes persons with disabilities as the third largest market segment in the US. Market growth opportunities do exist for people who care and organizations who care about accessibility. Become that differentiator, become essential.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Microsoft president Brad Smith prioritized accessibility across all products. He funded the AI for Accessibility program as part of Microsoft's AI for good initiative. The world's best companies are already leveraging accessibility, and they care winning because of it. Three secrets to accessibility success.
