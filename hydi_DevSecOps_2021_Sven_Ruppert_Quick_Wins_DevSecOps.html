              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                The hidden virus spread to 18,000 government and private computer networks. Microsoft has assigned 500 engineers to dig into the attack. Attack was unprecedented in audacity and scope. And by all accounts, it's still going on.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Today we want to talk about how to start with security inside DevOps environment. What is main or what are the four main areas of cyber defense and what you can do. Why build info or build metadata is a very good weapon against cybertext. If you like it, give me a thumbs up and subscribe my channel.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SolarWinds is producing software to manage network infrastructure. Hackers targeted the CI environment inside the SolarWinds company. Every infection with the hack was completely different. This shows the different possibilities or the different angles we have to look at.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Solar wins hack was really a nightmare. It was infecting a bunch of different governmental institutions from the US government. And this was leading to a reaction called the executive order of cybersecurity. An executive order is something that is changing the way the governmental internally works.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you're fighting against cyberattacks as a regular developer, we have possibilities every day. I want to highlight the four main areas before I'm talking about the content of the executive order of cybersecurity and then what we can do against it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The interactive application security testing is a mix of static and dynamic testing. The approach makes only sense in production or on production systems. Attacks against all components inside the production line or supply chain. What is the best technique to start for this?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mr. Biden gave this executive order of cybersecurity. Every software that's operated, used, created by the US government must fulfill the requirement of creating an ANS bomb. It is more or less affecting the whole economy because so many companies are working directly or indirectly for US government.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Built info is a context of how to create binaries and what is content of it. Why you should use built info instead of pure S bomb? You need a place where you're storing all binaries so that you have the full impact graph.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So what I'm doing next? Well, my day is done. It's the second day of my hiking trip, so I will now pack my stuff. Together we'll have something to eat. We'll walk, I think in this direction to my car. It will take, I don't know, two 3 hours and then I'm done for today.
