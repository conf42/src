                Arfad: Today I'll talk about how to be a digital nomad without losing your job. He says there's two kinds of traveling. One is the ability to see the same things you're always seeing, but with a different outlook. His goal in life is to inspire people to learn to do the second kind of travel.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are in a unique place in history where we can use our work to work remotely. Remote work is something that's considered not only acceptable, in fact, it's even encouraged in our workforce. It's time that we take the full advantage of this opportunity to travel and explore the world while still maintaining our jobs.

              </li>

                "I'm moving over and actually living in a ski resort. I set up my work desk. I'm happy as a person could be " He negotiated a deal with the owner of the hostel. Those were some pretty happy times for him.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can literally live anywhere. Anywhere. Literally anywhere, as long as you learn how to negotiate. I could literally start messaging random hotels, outhouses, Airbnbs, anywhere which has a house which has an empty space. Places would give me 50% to 60% off simply because I asked.

              </li>

                A man leased a large piece of land in Surrey, in Vancouver, to do organic farming. Surrey is one of the most expensive real estate areas in Canada. When he signed the lease, the lease was for just one dollars. It shows you something very important that in any business, deal in any contract.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Never be afraid to ask for the absurd. Whether it's like a hotel where you want to live at, whether it's an Airbnb, whether you're buying a car from a rental dealership. You can get the best deal just depending on how smart you are with negotiation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You don't need these fancy resorts to live at. You can always find much cheaper options. What you can always do is to pair up your membership with a membership of a remote workplace office. And then you can stay at any crappy place that works just enough for you to sleep.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The fourth rule of digital nomadism is minimalism is very hard, but it's worth it. I ended up giving away all my possessions and everything I didn't need. You can do a much smaller version of this in your own. Just stick to the bare minimum of what you need.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make lists of all the things you need in a place. Write down apartment search as an optimization problem. Always do things in a legal manner when traveling. Don't skate around legal logistics, taxes, all that kind of stuff.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                CNN's John Bare says cheap experimentation is your best friend. Take small vacations every now and then and just try out a different place. Once you have enough good results from your cheap experimentation, use it to do a major move.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For me, traveling is about having a new outlook on life. I think it combines all the other aspects of life that give me meaning and joy. Whatever you choose, it doesn't really matter as long as you're enjoying yourself.

              </li>
