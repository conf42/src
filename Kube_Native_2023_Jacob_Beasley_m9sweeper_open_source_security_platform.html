              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Jacob Beasley is a certified Kubernetes security specialist and administrator. He also leads a team who supports the open source project Msweeper, which you're going to be learning a lot about. It's essentially a Kuberne security platform that takes all the tools the Cloud native Foundation recommends.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you think about security in kubernetes, we think of it as a layered security model. The next layer is the Kubernetes cluster itself. Then we'll look at the container. By the time we finish this presentation, these aren't going to be foreign concepts for you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubernetes is a container orchestration engine. The majority of our efforts revolve around making sure that access to that API is limited. Don't expose your API on the Internet, and don't make everybody an administrator.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Role based access control simply means preventing people from having too much access to the cluster. Once you have a role, you then bind it to something. Users are not actually a thing that exists in Kubernetes directly. Service accounts allow applications to communicate with API.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next we're going to look at a couple of tools, Kubebench and Kubernetes. For every other major technology, there are an established set of benchmarks that you should follow. Most companies that are successful securing Windows or Linux will simply use the right tools.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The Linux kernel supports several features that enable containers to work from the perspective of your application. Virtualization is considered less segregated than hardware separation. Containers have quite a bit of isolation but if you're not careful, or if there's a Linux security vulnerability, maybe you could break out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In a container you create a container image. The image is actually a layered file system. Inside of a container, we have a command that is used by default to boot up whatever application you're containerizing. Almost every part of this can be overridden at runtime.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The worst case scenario is you don't secure a container and then the application can break out. Whenever you are deployments an app to kubernetes, we need to set a security context. If you wanted to enforce or at least make sure people are following best practices, there's a great tool.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't allow applications to run as root or escalate privileges. Be very careful with host volumes. Use tools like OPA, gatekeeper, pod security policies, and pod security standards. Finally limit service account privileges.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We've built a UI around Cubesec. It will analyze the manifest of a pod and give you advice. We've made it even better with can easy to use Ui so that it's easy for your team to use.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have three pre made standards for Kubernetes security, privileged baseline and restricted. Start with baseline and then finally restricted, which requires you to set quite a bit. We've created an open source project that makes deploying apps with restricted pod security standards fairly easy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                K eight EZ is a helm chart for deploying apps to Kubernetes. It allows you to deploy an app just by specifying the name. Or you can create a full values file to configure everything you could think of. By default the security context is fairly locked down.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubernetes network policies allow you to limit what pods can connect to what pods. There's a lot of applications where people are not doing any authentication or authorization on internal backend APIs. Not all container network interfaces support it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Gatekeeper is a plugin for Kubernetes to allow you to describe policies. It will assess and enforce those policies. Think of it as different kinds of operations you want to do. Pretty powerful stuff.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next I want to talk about code scanning. We can scan everything that's currently running in your cluster. You can even block things from booting up that don't meet your standards. And you can create exceptions for teams that need those. And there's a lot more in here too.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Project Falco is a rules engine for monitoring Kubernetes API logs or just Linux kernel calls with an EBPF filter so it can monitor for suspicious behavior. This allows you to configure alerts so that you're notified whenever something suspicious happens.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have an easy install guide on the left here. You can spin up a cluster and install all the tools in 2030 minutes. If you have any issues, if you go to GitHub. com msweeper our GitHub repository is where you'll see all the activity happening. We'd love to hear from you.
              </li>
