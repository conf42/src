    <meta property="og:title" content="Avoiding Goodhart's Law - Use SLO's as Tools Not Cudgels | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="The concepts of SLI, SLO and Error Budget are there to balance risk (rates of change) and reward (business contentment). Using such metrics as red lines to punish teams, or force acceptance of risk by the business is missing the point. My experiences from SLA’s in service contracts for hospitals inform this conversation identifying that SLI, SLO and Error Budgets are better as a basis for conversations about the stress an application can withstand, and the three dimensions the measures should cover.   This session takes Goodhart’s law from economic policy as a frame for reconsidering SLI’s and SLO’s, and offers a few hints for approaching the negotiation meetings. Leave this session inspired to approach your SLO negotiations in the best possible way."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>The concepts of SLI, SLO and Error Budget are there to balance risk (rates of change) and reward (business contentment). Using such metrics as red lines to punish teams, or force acceptance of risk by the business is missing the point. My experiences from SLA’s in service contracts for hospitals inform this conversation identifying that SLI, SLO and Error Budgets are better as a basis for conversations about the stress an application can withstand, and the three dimensions the measures should cover. </p>
<p>This session takes Goodhart’s law from economic policy as a frame for reconsidering SLI’s and SLO’s, and offers a few hints for approaching the negotiation meetings. Leave this session inspired to approach your SLO negotiations in the best possible way.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native. See the concepts of SLI and SLO and error budget. They're there to balance risk and reward risk around the acceptable rate of change. Using such metrics to punish teams for exceeding budgets is a path to failure.

              <li>
                Marco Coulter is an ex CTO who has worked for one of the top 50 international banks. Seeing technology from every side as an operator, a developer can analyst, a vendor, a buyer, and a CTO gives him a unique view on technology. Today's session comes in three chapters.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Marco Polo: Gaming the system means manipulating the rules meant to protect a system. In a prior life back in Australia, he worked for a service provider that supported all of the hospitals in a state. To avoid Goodhart's law, we need to focus on the measure as the target, not the outcome.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SLI, or service level indicators, are the numbers and work better when they are percentiles. Slos should capture the performance and availability levels that, if barely met, would keep your typical customer happy. Defining these ahead of time is critical.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To capture the overall environment, those nested slis supporting the customer experience should cover each of the three dimensions. From our code, we want functional code that does not fail, and additional measures and write downs of technical depth. Note the SLA goal also allows some wiggle room with the SLO.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As we add the infrastructure dimension, things get more complicated. You will be dealing with the full stack and often multiple stacks in multiple locations. What you're looking for is the infrastructure's ability to support, load, and deliver predictable latency. Hopefully that gives developers a sense of balance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We expect the bulk to occur normally within 30 seconds, well within the technical capabilities of the infrastructure. It just needs to be enough to keep the customer happy. You don't want to set it so high that you're overspending and under innovation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third dimension is the business, or if you're a nonprofit or a government body, the customer experience. As we add the business dimension, it can become difficult to measure the full experience. You need to consider all three dimensions for success.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 negotiating is a key skill for any SRE. Preparing to engage is about gathering information. Also identify a facilitator. Facilitation is a very specific skill.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The negotiating meeting has a general flow, right? You have your warm up, and here you set the scope for the discussion, the application, the dimensions, the business value. Now it's time to schedule the meetings and get on with your negotiations.
              </li>
