<p>In this talk, we will see a beautiful approach to planning data-based projects inspired by professionals from Google, Twitter, Microsoft, and more.
This talk will cover the following things -
1. Planning a data project sprint 
2. Establishing purpose and vision.
3. What data matters and what&rsquo;s trash?
4. Mining the sentiments of users.
5. Diminishing the silos.
6. Tools</p>
<p>After attending this talk, you would be able to think more clearly through the data project and really get amazing results.</p>

              Summary

                Aman Sharma: Data, data everywhere, no time to think. The perception of finding insights out of data is kind of the same. This is going to be an interesting journey that we are going to take today together.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aman Sharma is cofounder CTO, chief technology officer at Twimbit. Also a member at deep learning AI which helps bring technical knowledge in deep learning understanding to students. Advises startups and different organizations about their technology approach.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Being inside data is like sailing a boat in a deep ocean, right? The key objective over here is to identify the key insights which can help make people decisions. And also help them navigate through the tough course of finding key insights.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We'll see how to do visualizations for betterment of explaining what you mean by the data. Also we'll see the difference between approaches in code and no code tools. Finally, how better documenting and helps in overcoming the challenge of nondiscriminacy in data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first problem is the problem of goal clarity. Once your goal is clear, team always struggles with how to plan a project. This is the main reason of any chaotic situations and also leads to abandonment. The solution for this is a better project structure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Then you have a dirty data problem. The vastness of data expands and there is bad data in the same good data at the same time. It's very important to always clear these results. The solutions are advanced tools, which are data preprocessing tools.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is less transparency between the technical team who is working on these challenges and nontechnical team who are actually there to reap the benefits of the data. Solution to this is, again, no code is a better method to bring nontechnical people on board to any data science project.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem of silos. Like inside the organization, there are walls, invisible walls that are built between the data science team and the nondata science team. Solution to this is a combined solution of all these strategies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are four steps to this sprint approach, clear goal, plan well, execute and test and improvise. The whole target of doing a sprint is to achieve a limited scope in a limited timeline. Finally, make a map of how you are going to arrive at a solution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I think diagrams are really underrated when it comes to different teams. If you diagram something, it's visually appealing and it helps people make decisions faster. It also helps set realistic expectations and timelines. Here's a small demo of how you can create diagrams.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code and no code tools are very popular. No code tools have a low learning curve, almost very easy to learn about these drag and drop functions. It increases the productivity because you don't have to do different things. The core tools are divided into three main sentiments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next step. I think visualizations is also something that everybody in the team needs to be aware about how to use different charts and methods. The final step in doing all these things is dashboarding. Basically presenting your findings in a very organized manner and making it available for everybody.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Aman Sharma presents a presentation on how to use visualization to find insights out of data. This was not a code 101 or DIY that you might be expecting, but this was more around how to bring that exposure. If you really like the presentation, please let me know the feedback.
