              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                We're going to be talking about cloud metadata service and the abuses. We're seeing it on the front lines from different threat actors. We'll talk about that across the three major cloud platforms, AWS, GCP and Azure. And then towards the end we'll do a demo of exactly what the threat actors did.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nader Zaveri is a senior manager within Mandian's security transformational services practice. Brandon Sean Ruffer is a principal consultant with Mandiant services team focusing on incident response and digital forensics. Throughout the talk, you're going to hear me talk about things that I've seen from the front lines and organizations that are being proactive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The instance metadata service provides critical information. 93% of EC two instances had this misconfiguration and 95% of organizations across their span of 600 plus organizations had at least one or more instances. Once a threat actor has the ability to query this from the outside, they'll be able to obtain passwords.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud hosted services are a rather attractive target for similar threat actors. This may have been the first time we've seen a threat actors take a misconfiguration across an entire set of IP ranges against a cloud provider. We're going to focus on how to remediate this head on.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                All they needed was an IP address and a port. Amazon came out with IMDs version two back in November of 2019. One thing to do today or Monday is to check out your AwS EC two instances. Use open source tools to verify if you have an organization that runs AWS.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In general, this particular type of attack is pretty challenging to investigate. The metadata services themselves, at least for AWS, is rather sparse and limited. If you utilize AWS, detective, it now can group your guard duty alerts and your VPC flow logs for easier triaging.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's obviously not a vulnerability, it's a misconfiguration. A vulnerability scanner will not catch this. This is where you need to expand your vulnerability scanners to have something like an attack service management.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you guys have any questions for Brandon or Nader, they will be outside those doors to my right, your left in about 5 minutes. If you want to chat, we'll be back here at 245 in about 15 minutes.
              </li>
