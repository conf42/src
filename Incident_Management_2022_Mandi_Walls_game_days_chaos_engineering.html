    <meta property="og:description" content="How do you plan for unplanned incidents? You practice with Chaos Engineering. Strong incident response doesn't just happen, you have to build the skills and train your team. Practicing for major incidents gives your team insight into how your applications will behave when something goes wrong as well as how the team will interact to solve problems. Combining your Incident Response practices with Chaos Engineering roots your response practice in real-world scenarios, helping your team build confidence."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>How do you plan for unplanned incidents? You practice with Chaos Engineering. Strong incident response doesn&rsquo;t just happen, you have to build the skills and train your team. Practicing for major incidents gives your team insight into how your applications will behave when something goes wrong as well as how the team will interact to solve problems. Combining your Incident Response practices with Chaos Engineering roots your response practice in real-world scenarios, helping your team build confidence.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Mandy Walls is a DevOps advocate at Pagerduty. We've got some positions open. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can tweet at me. Also email me.

              <li>
                Having better incident response helps our reliability, it helps our customer experience. But getting better at incident response is a double edged sword. The goal of combining the structure of chaos engineering and specific tests with a regular cadence of tests.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos testing and game days are an excellent place to practice your incident response protocols in a low stakes environment. Too many teams spend time planning and executing game days and then not putting those process improvements back into their work stream.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are benefits to practicing a range of scenarios across your teams over time. But be very explicit about what you want to find. You can also focus on larger problems like DDoS attacks or data center failures. Get your assumptions down in writing so you can use them as a baseline for improvement.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Afterwards, make sure you're recording it. Save your charts, save your graphs, save the list of commands. This is also helpful in real life incidents so that you are collecting information to run your post incident review. You can use these experiments to create new best practices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Be very careful about deciding to run a surprise game day. Not everybody likes surprises. When's a good time to do this assessment of our reliability and resilience? Especially if you're in a sort of distributed microservices environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't game day right after a reorg. Don't wait until your busiest season and then game day, you're going to plan ahead. These tests are a way for your team to improve reliability. Make sure that everyone on the team is on board with taking those lessons and internalizing them.
