              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Currently, I'm leading the DevOps team at Netfoundry. We call it our Rav team, which stands for reliability, automation and visibility. I've used a lot of DevOps tools over the years. I'm generally pretty opinionated about which tools I like, which ones I don't.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Netfoundry is in the business of zero trust networking. What we assume is that the network itself is already compromised. It forces you to think about security differently in terms of what really needs access to what.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem in the DevOps space is pretty much every single tool that we use is an absolute gold mine for an attacker. Most people that I talk to are not comfortable with how they've set up their developer access. What do you do? You open the gates wide open.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The way that we secure our DevOps tools in particular, we got to step up our game. OpenZD is a zero trust networking platform. It's a way to connect systems together while stepping up security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                ZD allows controlled access between data centers. It's a massive step up from traditional networking or traditional VPN. The traffic is always encrypted from the source all the way to the destination. There's an SDK to create full end to end encryption from one application to another.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Netfoundry was challenged to try to dog food OpenZD and figure out how to use it internally. What he found was that it allowed him to step up his security game without introducing friction. And it really doesn't make the job harder.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
