    <meta property="og:description" content="70% of tech projects are unsuccessful due to human factors, not tech. It’s a people business—solutions are built by, with and for people, with tech serving only as a tool. Especially in the AI era, coding skills alone aren't enough. This talk dives into Skills Beyond Code and shares expert hacks."/>

<p>70% of tech projects are unsuccessful due to human factors, not tech. It’s a people business—solutions are built by, with and for people, with tech serving only as a tool.
