    <meta property="og:description" content="While applying distributed tracing on your own code is relatively simple, the real challenge is how to trace a full transaction across services. In this session, we'll understand the technical challenges gaining observability with managed services and see together how we can solve them.  Serverless computing transactions are a combination of owned code (like AWS Lambda) and managed services (Like SNS, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB and more). Applying distributed tracing on your own code through instrumentation is relatively simple (though require a lot of work). The challenge lays with the managed service, how to trace a full transaction across services like queues, streams, and databases.   In this session we will discuss:  - The technical challenges gaining observability with managed services.  - Methods to build the full trail of transactions across managed services.  - Ideas on how to obtain observability in a highly async distributed world.  - We’ll technically drill down to some managed services examples.  Let’s have an async observability discussion, to be continued on Discord."/>

<p>While applying distributed tracing on your own code is relatively simple, the real challenge is how to trace a full transaction across services. In this session, we&rsquo;ll understand the technical challenges gaining observability with managed services and see together how we can solve them.</p>
<p>Serverless computing transactions are a combination of owned code (like AWS Lambda) and managed services (Like SNS, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB and more). Applying distributed tracing on your own code through instrumentation is relatively simple (though require a lot of work). The challenge lays with the managed service, how to trace a full transaction across services like queues, streams, and databases. </p>
<p>In this session we will discuss: 
- The technical challenges gaining observability with managed services. 
- Methods to build the full trail of transactions across managed services. 
- Ideas on how to obtain observability in a highly async distributed world. 
- We’ll technically drill down to some managed services examples.</p>
<p>Let’s have an async observability discussion, to be continued on Discord.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                We're going to talk about observability in services applications with a special focus on those asynchronous parts which are much harder to observe. There's different solutions that you can use for services observability and we'll go over them so you can decide what's best for your own usage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lumigo is a serverless monitoring platform, serverless observability platform. Serverless is not only lambda in the meaning that it can also be function as a service from other cloud vendors like Google or Azure. Almost any application uses some third party. You need to know what's going on there.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Going serverless means that you have nanoservices in your environment. This allows you to decouple your services. The challenge is identifying and resolving issues. The third impact is the change in the cost paradigm. This brings with it new challenges.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we troubleshoot serverless, what are those challenges that we talked about, how they are implemented and how we can solve them? First thing you want to know is how this lambda impact your customers. What do you need in order to debug it?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloudwatch is actually a number of different services which you can use, metrics, logs, insights. There's also x ray allowing you to do some distributed tracing. The cons is it's complicated to use and it has only partial asynchronous support.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So now let's talk about option number two, homebrewed solutions. These solutions are the ability to add to your own code different data points. In the end this will allow you to correlate all that information on your own.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third option is serverless monitoring platforms. These are SaaS platforms focused on these kinds of solutions. Instead of doing all of this on your own, you get it just integrating to these platforms. It automates the distributed tracing.
