    <meta property="og:description" content="Remix is a great framework to build robust, progressively enhanced and interactive web apps!   During Covid we all missed the Parties.... therefore Dave will create his own party on stage. He will take you on a fun journey on how he created a multi-user and real-time progressive web app. But be aware, there is a guest list and not every solution is invited to join the party!   Dave will show you how the Remix friend group will keep your party rocking:  - where the state of your data is on the server where it belongs. (load some data and take action to get the party started). - where this multi-user web app is not dependent on complex client-side javascript (so even your drunk friend will understand it) - where the client-side is less error-prone (no party fouls wanted) - where the components are just plain stupid (no good story starts with a glass of milk) - where your application becomes simple and easy to understand (you know, for that friend)  Dave will tell you about the challenges he encountered building this web app and how it was solved charmingly by using Remix. He will show you how Remix can be used for web apps with a lot of interactivity not just for plain websites with an occasional form.  Getting FOMO? Make sure to sign up for the party and don’t miss out!"/>

<p>Remix is a great framework to build robust, progressively enhanced and interactive web apps! </p>
<p>During Covid we all missed the Parties.... therefore Dave will create his own party on stage. He will take you on a fun journey on how he created a multi-user and real-time progressive web app. But be aware, there is a guest list and not every solution is invited to join the party!</p>
<p>Dave will show you how the Remix friend group will keep your party rocking:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the state of your data is on the server where it belongs. (load some data and take action to get the party started).</li>
<li>where this multi-user web app is not dependent on complex client-side javascript (so even your drunk friend will understand it)</li>
<li>where the client-side is less error-prone (no party fouls wanted)</li>
<li>where the components are just plain stupid (no good story starts with a glass of milk)</li>
<li>where your application becomes simple and easy to understand (you know, for that friend)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dave will tell you about the challenges he encountered building this web app and how it was solved charmingly by using Remix. He will show you how Remix can be used for web apps with a lot of interactivity not just for plain websites with an occasional form.</p>
<p>Getting FOMO? Make sure to sign up for the party and don’t miss out!</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Jamaica make a real time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems. observing changes, exceptions, errors in real time allows youre to not only experiment with confidence but respond instantly to get things working again. We'll cover everything in the next 35 minutes and have a look together at web fundamentals.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 remix is a full stack web framework, emphasis on the web part based on web fundamentals. It aims to help you leverage the browser, leverage the web as a platform instead of working against it. People are sometimes not embracing the platform we are building for which is the web.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What we use is file based routing. We have in remix an app folder, where we have a routes folder. Finally, we have this root TSX, which is basically the wrapper around the entire application remix, or rather react router nowadays. You can find all of that in the basic readme of remix.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 remix is a tool that helps you handle forms on the web. Instead of just a regular HTML five form, it does full requests to handle your logic. What remix is really focused on is also your error handling. It can enhance the user experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Once you join or created a session where you can actually run the application that looks a bit like this. We're going to do some starts server side rendering and that's important. Then we have the core of our interactivity for the user, which is here.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Instead of an action you have something called a loader. This is a function that whenever somebody fits a URL, it's going to execute this function where we basically get our data. So we can get the latest state from the server basically of the session and display that. We can also add some interactivity now with CSS. It's not about your user not having client side Javascript it's about reducing the complexity of your app.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Remix offers a couple of helper functions to get you started. You can use server sessions to save data for you. We do everything on the server where it's safe and on the client is as dumb as we can keep it. We can even make this more secure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Modern Ux doesn't need clients at Javascript to have real time updates. Instead it uses a use superbase subscription to subscribe on any change that you want to. That is the entire layer of adding real time to this application.
              </li>
