                Efficiency in motion mastering is delivery without compromising stability. I work as a senior architect with a company simpler who is into the domain of intranet platforms. I specialize in creating products using microservices and event driven architecture. What we will look at is what all changes this team had to go through to embrace a continuous delivery.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most companies are by default going with microservices architecture. It is nothing but an independent deployable unit modeled around a business domain. The key advantage is team autonomous. You want to ensure that whatever you are delivering is not breaking any of the existing features.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A deployment of a service into production is not equal to a feature release. Every feature which I develop goes behind something called as a feature toggle, a feature flag. Even half built code can still make into the production because the flag is turned off by default. This is what we are trying to do when we are doing continuous delivery.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You are able to take advantage of a microservices architecture. The risk is literally zero. You have near real zero downtime deployment. It gives you enough flexibility on the feature release. You can embrace trunk based development. But it is not going to be easy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you work with feature flags, right, you need to be very careful in terms of how you name the feature flag. All the feature flags that you add in the code, they eventually have to be removed. Without breaking anything is a key. observability cannot be an afterthought.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
