Yes,,Hilik Paz,Co-founder & CEO,Arato.ai,,,,Model-Based Input Validation for Preventing Prompt Injection Attacks,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into various applications, the threat of prompt injection attacks has emerged as a significant security concern. This presentation introduces a novel model-based input validation approach to mitigate these attacks in LLM-integrated applications.

We present a meta-prompt methodology that acts as an intermediate validator, examining user inputs before they reach the LLM. Our approach builds on established input validation techniques, drawing parallels with traditional security measures like SQL injection prevention.

Throughout the presentation, we will discuss the challenges of input validation in LLM contexts and explore how our model-based approach provides a more flexible and adaptive solution. We'll share preliminary results from evaluations against established prompt injection datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our methodology in detecting and mitigating various types of injection attempts.

Join us for an insightful exploration of this innovative approach to enhancing the security of LLM applications through advanced prompt engineering techniques, and learn how to implement robust input validation mechanisms to safeguard your AI-driven systems.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/hilikpaz/,,,,,Hilik Paz_prompt.png,https://youtu.be/T2V0WMI6Ziw,"model-based,input,validation",

No,security,Pavan Vovveti,,Staffordshire University,,,,A Framework for Securing IoT Integrations with Third-Party Services Across Critical Sectors,"The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, which saw 3.4 billion cellular IoT connections in 2023, has enabled seamless integration between IoT applications and third-party services across industries such as smart cities, healthcare, and automotive. This integration has delivered significant functional and efficiency benefits but also introduced critical security challenges. Our framework addresses these challenges, particularly focusing on secure authentication, authorization, and communication to protect sensitive data across its lifecycle. For example, integrating third-party analytics in smart city applications has proven to reduce crime rates by up to 40% and optimize emergency response times by 35%, yet it necessitates robust security mechanisms to maintain data integrity. In healthcare, the use of IoT in patient monitoring can drastically improve chronic disease management but requires stringent API security and data privacy protocols.

We propose a comprehensive model emphasizing multi-factor authentication, token-based systems like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and end-to-end encryption using AES-256. Case studies, such as the SmartSantander project, demonstrate our model’s effectiveness, highlighting a 20% reduction in urban air pollution and a 25% decrease in parking-related traffic congestion. Additionally, we explore emerging trends like 5G-driven connectivity and edge intelligence, which are projected to process 75% of enterprise-generated data locally by 2025, enhancing real-time decision-making and data privacy.

Our approach balances the drive for innovation with rigorous security measures, offering best practices for organizations seeking to leverage third-party integrations while ensuring data privacy and protection. This work provides a valuable roadmap for IoT stakeholders, emphasizing the ongoing need for adaptive, resilient security strategies to safeguard evolving IoT ecosystems.",,,,,Pavan Vovveti - Conf42 Prompt Engineering 2024.pdf,Pavan Vovveti_prompt.png,https://youtu.be/guLpm9FNNHU,"securing,iot,integrations",
