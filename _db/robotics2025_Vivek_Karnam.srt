1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,860
Hello.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,000
Good day everyone.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,030
I'm very working as a senior
resident computer program with Search

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,760
Technology Solutions here in us.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,770
So here I am today to present
my ideas on emergency response

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,690
using AI driven cloud computing,
robotics, and predictive analysis.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,780
With all this being said let
me start my presentation.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,730
So before getting into the actual
presentation, I would like to first

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,770
provide you some insights on what are
the present challenges that we are

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,750
facing with the options that we have
with the traditional emergency responses.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,870
So here I would like to
emphasize on two points.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,580
The first one being the
growing disaster intensity.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,220
So when I say growing disaster intensity.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,480
I am more emphasizing on the climate
change that accelerated the frequency and

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,209
severity of national disasters worldwide.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,100
So the traditional emergency response
systems build on legacy infrastructure and

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,660
manual coordination struggle to keep pace
with the speed and scale of modern crisis.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,910
And that being said, these conventional
approaches rely heavily on human

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,280
decisions and soil communication
channels and reactive rather

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,660
than being proactive measures.

21
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:13,485
So creating dangerous gaps in
response times and resource

22
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,955
allocation with this existing options.

23
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,375
So the first one being
growing disaster intensity.

24
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,915
The second one is
systematic vulnerabilities.

25
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:29,024
So when I say systematic vulnerabilities,
they are like more of the fragmented

26
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:34,705
data sources preventing unified situation
awareness and slow information, limited

27
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:36,775
predict to capabilities and inadequate.

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,460
Cross jurisdictional coordination
mechanisms and also some

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,780
communication bottlenecks.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,400
So these are a couple of issues that
we are facing with current day options

31
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,370
with respect to the emergency response.

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,240
Let's start with a new patterning
of safety and security operations.

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,539
So here when I say a new paradigm,
it's more of integration of artificial

34
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,960
intelligence with cloud computing,
robotics, and predictive analytics.

35
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:05,315
Which represents a fundamental shift in
how safety and security operation systems

36
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,525
that is SOS functions during emergencies.

37
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:13,935
And by unifying disparate technologies
into cohesive frameworks, we create the

38
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:19,295
system cap capable of processing vast
data streams and predicting disaster

39
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:23,575
trajectories and automating critical
decisions and deploying resources with

40
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:26,125
unprecedented precision and speed.

41
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:31,575
So now for this speed and to achieve
this strength, so I would like

42
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:35,864
to concentrate more on three core
technologies, which actually are

43
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,904
powering our intelligence response.

44
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,975
That is power lifting
our intelligent response.

45
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,505
The first one being machine learning.

46
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:45,714
So the pattern recognition
algorithms that the machine

47
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:47,904
learning analyzes using historical.

48
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,549
Disaster data to predict event
likelihood, severity, and

49
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,169
optimal intervention strategies.

50
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,509
And the next one is visual deep learning.

51
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,989
When I say visual deep learning, it's more
about the computer vision, the systems

52
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,269
process, like the satellites are providing
as the imaginary, sorry, imagery and the

53
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,249
drone footages and surveillance speeds
to assess damage and identify hazards.

54
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,079
And the next one being NLP.

55
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,019
That is natural language
processing here in NLP.

56
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,679
We use engines that extract action
level intelligence from emergency calls

57
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:28,529
and from, say, some social media and
other news channels using the filtering

58
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,899
signal from noise during the crisis.

59
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:36,539
So that being said I also want to
emphasize on transforming fragmented

60
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,729
data into actionable intelligence.

61
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,769
Here we are using three concepts.

62
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,259
The first one is data collection, AI
processing, and actionable insights.

63
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,039
These three actually transform
the fragmented data into

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,479
an actionable intelligence.

65
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,119
So first one, as I said,
is data collection.

66
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,719
So with data collection we more rely
on the satellite imaginary imagery,

67
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,549
the IOT sensors, the social media,
and some emergency communications.

68
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:09,249
So coming to AI processing be
more to utilize the real time data

69
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:13,129
pattern detection, threat assessment,
and some prediction models.

70
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,439
And the last one being
actionable insights.

71
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,249
So here in actionable insights sorry.

72
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,019
If we use some resource deployment,
evacuation roads and situational

73
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,819
awareness and decision support.

74
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:30,229
So using all these three
intelligent actionable items we can.

75
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:35,904
Converge multiple data streams, each with
different formats, update frequencies

76
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:40,844
at reliable levels and present both
technical and operational challenges.

77
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:46,684
And also, AI systems must harmonize these
inputs, validate information accurately.

78
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:52,159
And this being said, let's go to the
next slide where I want to showcase

79
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,684
the cloud native architecture.

80
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,409
Wherein I have utilized serverless
and continuous platforms, these two.

81
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,189
And let's get started
with the architecture.

82
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:05,349
So when I say serverless and content,
continuous platforms still mostly I'm

83
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,369
talking about cloud native architectures,
which enable emergency response systems

84
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,989
to scale dynamically during crisis and
leveraging serverless functions for

85
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:16,879
efficient data stream processing without
any infrastructure management overhead.

86
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:17,194
Okay.

87
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:22,244
And coming to the content rights
platforms so here, when I say content

88
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:26,084
rights platforms, it's more likely
about Kubernetes which ensures us high

89
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:31,214
availability through automatic failover,
load balancing, and multiple regional

90
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:35,444
deployment, and also guaranteeing
the operational continuity even

91
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,034
when the local infrastructure fail.

92
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,299
So considering these two platforms.

93
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,934
So we can also leverage the rapid
elastic scaling using automatic resource

94
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:49,194
allocation during demand spikes and
geographical redundancy wherein multiple

95
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:51,294
region deployment for disaster resilience.

96
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:55,794
And the last one being cross
jurisdictional continuity wherein seamless

97
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:58,044
data sharing between agencies and regions.

98
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:00,814
So this is about the native
cloud native architecture.

99
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:05,344
And coming to next slide
here, I want to showcase.

100
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,049
A smart city flood
management using AI inaction.

101
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,289
So what I'm doing here is I
consider a metropolitan area,

102
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:17,069
which is facing unprecedented
rainfall and rising river levels.

103
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,349
So here the traditional systems, like
we spoke about in the first slide

104
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,519
which mostly rely on manual process,
like on manual gauge ratings, weather

105
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,649
forecasts, and some historical flood maps.

106
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:35,389
All processed by human coordinators
making evacuation decisions really

107
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,189
extreme in, in, in real extreme pressure.

108
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,799
So what is AI doing here?

109
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,439
So AI system transforms this scenario
entirely, the predictive model

110
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,099
analysis using the rainfall patterns,
soil saturation, river flow rates,

111
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:55,334
and tide schedules to forecast
flood extent before water arrives.

112
00:06:56,224 --> 00:07:01,374
So this this, all this data is
leveraged by ai and the other thing

113
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:07,524
is the comfort vision monitors for
managing the blockages in the systems.

114
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,704
And apart from that, we also have
the NLP which uses social media

115
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:16,144
posts and news channels for emerging
flight reports in the real time.

116
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:20,064
So these are some points
that AI is leveraged.

117
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:24,044
And coming to enhanced capabilities
through intelligent systems.

118
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:27,524
And these capabilities come
with three points here.

119
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,534
The first one being dynamic
evacuation planning.

120
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:34,634
So here the A optimizes evacuation
rules based on realtime traffic

121
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:39,424
and predicted flood parts and
shelter capacity and updating

122
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,224
recommendations as conditions evolve.

123
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,894
And the second one being
unified situation level.

124
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:44,074
Yes.

125
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,474
Here I want to talk about
integrating dashboards.

126
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:53,634
That is some consolidated data from all
sources wherein we provide these data

127
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:58,624
to the managers with comprehensive use
with the present unfolding situations.

128
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:01,144
The last one being intelligent
resource allocation.

129
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:06,394
Here we use ml, that is machine
learning, which predicts resource

130
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,464
needs by location and time.

131
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:08,614
Okay.

132
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:14,304
Using this data we can supply the
personal the personals to that particular

133
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:17,244
location before the crisis actually peaks.

134
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,024
The situation is out of control.

135
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,804
So this is about the intelligent systems.

136
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:27,089
And in the next site I want to show
you a scenario, a simulated scenario

137
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,409
with some geospatial mapping.

138
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,289
Using some predictive visualization.

139
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,069
So here let's say some advanced
geospatial systems create high resolution

140
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:39,089
urban models integrating terrain
infrastructure and population data.

141
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,439
This enables precise flood extent
predictions and impact assessments.

142
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:50,214
So in this scenario, the
simulation tools that analyze.

143
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:54,944
Allowing the emergency managers to
visualize consequences of various

144
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:59,655
interventions such as opening flood
barriers or issuing evacuation

145
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,175
items based on the scenario.

146
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:06,975
This simulations account for
cascading effects, ensuring informed

147
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,285
strategic planning for the managers.

148
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:13,655
And the next one is to
build this response.

149
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:14,915
We need some real time data.

150
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,445
And for if you want to use some real
time data, we should maintain privacy

151
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,725
and some ethical considerations.

152
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,725
So here are three points with respect
to real time data and the privacy and

153
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:28,345
ethical considerations with this data.

154
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,705
So I would like to talk
about three points here.

155
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,695
The first one being data minimization
principles wherein we collect only

156
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:39,715
information essential for emergency
response and implement automatic

157
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,005
data retention policies that.

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,130
Purge personal details once
immediate crisis results.

159
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,020
Okay, and the second one being
the algorithmic transparency.

160
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,489
So here with the emerging
emergency AI systems they provide

161
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:58,239
explainable decisions, particularly
when recommendations affect

162
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,739
individual rights or safety.

163
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,499
And the decision audit trials enable
post-crisis review and accountability with

164
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,599
respect to the algorithmic transparency.

165
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,644
And the last one with the real time data.

166
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,384
It's consent and community trust.

167
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:17,654
So here mostly in this third point, we
engage the community in the system design

168
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:22,124
and governance and clear communication
about data usage will be given to the

169
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:26,714
community and other consent mechanisms
for non-emergency periods and community

170
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:31,644
oversight which helps build public
trust essentially for the system

171
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,084
being very effective with respect to.

172
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:38,124
So this is what is the privacy
and ethical considerations

173
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,294
with respect to real time data.

174
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:45,124
And going to the next slide here, we
have some frontiers innovations looking

175
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,894
forward for the next you next innovations.

176
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:51,524
So here I want to talk about four
points over here with respect to

177
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:52,634
the forward looking innovations.

178
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:56,264
The first one being digital wins,
wherein the virtual replicas

179
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,484
of physical infrastructure
enabled continuous simulation.

180
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,549
Stress testing and optimization of
emergency response plans against

181
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,079
evolving urban environments.

182
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,549
So that being said, in the second
point we use edge computing.

183
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,949
So the distributed processing at network
edges enables ultra latency decisions

184
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,779
when cloud connectivity is compromised.

185
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,749
And this is about edge computing.

186
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,399
And the third one being
federated learning.

187
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,799
So the city's collaboratively train AI
models without sharing sense to data.

188
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,029
Wherein we improve predictive
accuracy while preserving

189
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,399
privacy and local autonomy.

190
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,799
And the last one being autonomous robots.

191
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:37,899
So here, basically what we do is at
the ground and aerial situations robots

192
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,909
perform delivery supplies wherein when
I say robots perform, it's only the

193
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,009
situation when humans by themself when
they cannot get into the situation

194
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:49,749
or cannot get into that environment.

195
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,479
Of rescue operations.

196
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:56,639
Then we use these robots, which do
the delivery actions, the risking

197
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,829
actions in those tough environments.

198
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:03,979
So these are couple of forward looking
innovations and going to the next slide.

199
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,149
So here, with all these points,
considering all these points and

200
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,319
accumulating all these points, I
built intelligent response framework

201
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,539
with some practical strategies.

202
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,109
And the first practical strategy
being assess capabilities.

203
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,629
So here I audit existing systems
and data to identify gaps.

204
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,900
And after that we established data
infrastructure wherein we deploy sensor

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,879
networks and secure cloud platforms.

206
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,339
And after that we develop AI models.

207
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:37,410
And in developing these AI models, we
train and refine AI on instant data.

208
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:41,609
And after the development of AI
models, we integrate it and test it.

209
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,129
And we connected it to AI, to workflows,
and then we simulate it and we test it.

210
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,639
And after simulation and
testing, we train the personnel.

211
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:55,469
That is what we do here, is we educate
the teams on AI capabilities and views.

212
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:58,649
The last point being iterate and improve.

213
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,189
So here what we do is we collect
feedback and based on the feedback,

214
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:06,419
we improve, like we continuously
improve and update and enhance the ai.

215
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,519
So after all these things let's talk
about some impacts life saved, resources

216
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,349
optimized resilience strengthened.

217
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,949
So here the first point about the
impacts is like the faster response time.

218
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,899
So the AI driven systems reduce decision
making delays and accelerate resource

219
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,824
deployment during critical windows.

220
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,709
And the second one being
improved resource efficiency.

221
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,160
So here some predictive allocation
prevents waste while ensuring

222
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,459
adequate supplies reach affected
areas in time when needed.

223
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,610
And the third one being
enhance situational awareness.

224
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,470
So here we use some unified data
platforms where we provide emergency situ,

225
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,300
emergency information to the managers.

226
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,150
It's significant comprehensive
crisis visibility to the managers

227
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,725
so that they can act accordingly.

228
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:59,335
And beyond quantitative metrics
intelligence, emergency response systems

229
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:01,645
fundamentally transform urban resilience.

230
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:06,235
And then cities become adaptive
organisms capable of anticipating

231
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:11,335
threats and acting accordingly, and
coordinating complex responses across

232
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:16,735
agencies and learning from each incident
how better we can improve in future

233
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,885
by providing a better performance.

234
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,575
So this is about the impacts.

235
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,970
And going to the next slide is here.

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,300
I would like to conclude saying, building
the future of emergency response is

237
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,350
always possible when we leverage AI with
cloud computing, robotics, and predictive

238
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:43,119
analysis fundamentally to protect
societies during this emergency crisis.

239
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:48,520
So as disasters escalate, the
rapid and responsible deployment

240
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,319
of intelligent systems is crucial.

241
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,889
The frameworks and strategies
discussed offer a roadmap for emergency

242
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,680
management professionals the city
planners and technology leaders.

243
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,849
So what I'm trying to say here is with all
the suggestions and the frameworks and the

244
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:09,130
technology points we can always achieve.

245
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,230
A better intelligent
adaptive AI response feature.

246
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,780
So this is all about the emergency
response using ai wherein we

247
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,869
leverage cloud computing, robotics,
and plate predictive analysis.

248
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,480
So I would like to thank you for giving
me this opportunity to put forth my

249
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,839
ideas and give a presentation about.

250
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,470
The emergency responses using AI platform.

251
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,659
Thank you everyone.

252
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,199
Have a good day.
