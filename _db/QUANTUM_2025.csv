not just a luxury but a key competitive advantage. This presentation explores the pivotal role of
data engineering and quantum-enhanced AI in enabling real-time, AI-driven personalization of
financial products and services. It highlights how institutions can leverage Customer Data
Platforms (CDPs), real-time analytics platforms, quantum computing innovations, and
cutting-edge AI techniques to deliver tailored financial solutions that drive customer engagement
and satisfaction.
CDPs act as the cornerstone for personalization, aggregating diverse customer data from multiple
touchpoints to provide financial institutions with a comprehensive, 360-degree customer view.
With this unified data, quantum-augmented AI systems can assess customer behaviors,
preferences, and pain points, generating actionable insights that empower the delivery of highly
customized services. Additionally, the emergence of generative AI and quantum computing
further enhances this dynamic by enabling the creation of personalized content and AI-powered
chatbots capable of fostering individualized, conversational experiences.
Data engineering plays a critical role in managing the challenges of processing vast amounts of
customer data in real time, ensuring systems are efficient, responsive, and secure. This session
will delve into strategies for overcoming these challenges while showcasing the transformative
impact of AI, quantum computing, and data engineering in reshaping personalized financial
services for the modern, tech-savvy consumer.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkat-boggavarapu,,,,Venkateswarlu Boggavarapu - Conf42 Quantum Computing 2025.pdf,Venkateswarlu Boggavarapu_quantum.png,https://youtu.be/pagMl4qnr9E,"finance,optimization",

No,architecture,Laxmikanth Mukund Sethu Kumar,Executive Director,JPMorgan Chase,,,,Bridging Classical and Quantum: Preparing Enterprise Architecture for the Quantum Era,"Quantum computing may not be production-ready for every enterprise use case just yet—but the time to start preparing is now. This session offers a practical, systems-oriented perspective on how organizations can begin laying the architectural groundwork for future quantum integration. Drawing on experience designing platforms for banks, airlines, and government systems, we’ll explore actionable patterns such as event-driven design, hybrid orchestration, and API-driven interfaces that naturally align with quantum-enabled workflows.

Rather than diving deep into quantum mechanics, this talk focuses on what real-world architects and engineering leaders can do today to future-proof their systems. Attendees will walk away with a clear understanding of how cloud-native principles can accelerate readiness, and why thinking about integration early matters just as much as the underlying quantum tech.

Ideal for system architects, engineering leads, and technology strategists looking for a grounded, enterprise lens on the quantum shift.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/laxmikanthmukund/,,,,Laxmikanth Mukund Sethu Kumar - Conf42 Quantum Computing 2025.pdf,Laxmikanth Mukund Sethu Kumar_quantum.png,https://youtu.be/w2ehzwRRpvY,"classical,quantum,enterprise",
