00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,200
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,060
Thank you for joining me.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,800
I'm Raul Pingle from Wal.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,200
I'm a technical Director at Wal West.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,760
Today I'll be sharing how maternal
engineering, specifically in Wal Rings and

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,339
non-owned substrate, plays a direct role
in advancing iot connectivity robotics

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,839
sustainable building metal system.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,700
This presentation is about how we
turn something as ordinary as wall.

9
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,939
Into active part of smart environment.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,309
Let's start by looking at why our
current infrastructure isn't keeping

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,710
up with today's connected world.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,660
Traditional building materials,
especially vinyl wall coverings,

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,210
face a challenge for smart buildings.

14
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:50,480
They often emit VOC block the
wireless signals and are difficult

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,070
to replace when sensors or
automation systems needs upgrades.

16
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,275
This means our physical space are
holding back digital progress.

17
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:06,905
To overcome this, we need a new
generation of material surface that don't

18
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:12,215
just decorate the wall, but actively
enables connectivity and automation.

19
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:17,435
Our team engineered three key
breakthrough that makes this possible.

20
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:19,865
Let's see, what are
those three breakthrough?

21
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,345
So this three breakthrough
one is nano barrier.

22
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:24,605
Coatings.

23
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:30,995
A Microsphere PSA technology and
multi-meter printability gives us

24
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:35,285
the better digitally enabled space.

25
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,575
So microsphere coatings for
superior moisture protection.

26
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:44,905
Microsphere system is for
responsible clean installation.

27
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:50,985
A multi-meter printability allowing
us use of, grab your digital flexo

28
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:57,555
printing methods together, this form of
sustainable iot ready surface platform.

29
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:04,845
Smart environments needs surface material
that interact, not just insulate or decor.

30
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:10,305
They must support embedded
sensors, RFID systems and QR

31
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:12,704
code automation while being safe.

32
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:17,055
Recycle and easy to remove or replace.

33
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:21,435
Essentially, the wall itself
becomes part of the iot ecosystem.

34
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:26,115
Let's take a closer look at each
of these technology, starting

35
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,485
with the nano barrier coatings.

36
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:34,335
Our water-based nano barrier coating
replace solid based vinyls based

37
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,915
coatings while matching their durability.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,400
It's validated to ASTM 96 with the
moisture vapor transmission outperforming

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,860
most non ones under high humidity.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,620
And because it's zero solvent,
there are no VOC emissions or

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,110
disposable issue making it safer for
both manufacturing and occupants.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,100
Let's now see that how we have
solved the barrier challenge it.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,210
Look at how we.

44
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,420
Tackle the addition, the conventional
additive for permanent form, the permanent

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,480
bonds that makes remote destructive.

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,190
Our microsphere pressure sensor
Additive technology creates a tiny

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,940
contact points instead of a solid
layer, gives high strength while still

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
allowing full removal without damage.

49
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,790
This means sensors, wall panels, or
digital display can be repositioned.

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
Are replaced without surface repairs.

51
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,240
It's ideal for iot enable
buildings that evolves over time.

52
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,420
Next come most exciting part, how this
materials enable printing, coding and

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,190
sensing directly onto the surface.

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,795
We design the subset to work
seamlessly with the NJ Flexography

55
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,490
and UV digital technology system.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
That means we can print.

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,280
RFID, an antenna Q codes.

58
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,170
Conductive or conductive inks
stresses directly onto the surface.

59
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,390
This allows the wall itself to
communicate acting as a layer

60
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,190
for automation and robotics.

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,510
And this brings us to how
this metal integrate into the

62
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,310
iot and robotics ecosystem.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,070
The smart walls enables three things.

64
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,170
Wireless transparency, maintaining a
signal strength for robotics and sensors.

65
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:37,415
Embedded sensors such as
temperature occupancy detector are

66
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:40,155
right built right into the wall.

67
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:46,455
Much readable markers like cure codes,
NFC Chiefs, that guides autonomous

68
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:52,635
navigation in short surface, become the
communication fabric for connected spaces.

69
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,750
But innovation only matters if it is.

70
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,860
Meets safety sustainability standards.

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,570
Let's look at the, our compliance.

72
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,830
Our platform meets strong V emission
testing like CDP 0 1 3 5 0 for

73
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,310
ultra low V-O-C-A-S-T-M 84 Class A
Fire Safety and complies with the

74
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,930
reach and well building standards.

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,610
It's free from ATE ha heavy metals.

76
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,480
This ensures smart doesn't come at
the cost of health and Ann enrollment.

77
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,070
We validated all this through
independent standard based testing.

78
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,700
Every compliance property needs barrier,
addition fire, UC performance, and is

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,040
verified through A STM and testing.

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,170
We even simulate five year
durability to ensure stability

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,880
across different climates.

82
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:52,045
This data driven validation, build trust,
especially in sector like healthcare

83
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:59,125
education where compliance is critical
and those are the exactly market where

84
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,195
we have already seen the strong adoption.

85
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:07,585
So we adopted this platform in over
more than 15 facility across North

86
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:11,005
America and Europe in hospitals.

87
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:15,205
It supports infection control and
integrates with the automation system.

88
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:19,245
In schools, it allows flexible
low emission learning space.

89
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:23,565
And in smart offices it enhance
connectivity for iot analytics.

90
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:28,895
This proves the technology is
ready and not just a theoretical.

91
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,725
So what does this mean for robotics
and connected environments?

92
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:38,405
So for robotics, this smart,
no-one surface serves as navigation

93
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:41,405
map data networks compliant.

94
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,225
Con infrastructure all at once.

95
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:50,735
They support RF transparency, embedded
sensing, asset tracking and damage

96
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:55,415
free updates, everything connected
space needs for autonomous systems.

97
00:06:56,285 --> 00:07:00,605
And to scale this across industries
structure, adoption approach is the key.

98
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,465
So we developed a four step
framework for implementation.

99
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:11,075
First, align material cap capability
with automation needs Second.

100
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,140
Engage facility IT and
sustainability team early.

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,080
Then third, run small scale pilot
trials to validate the results.

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,640
And fourth, use the data to
scalable the trials efficiently.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,230
This approach ensures every
deployment is both technically

104
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,760
and operationally successful.

105
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,965
Now, to wrap this up, let's
summarize key lesson from this work.

106
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:40,205
First smart material means smart
infrastructure, the enable IO,

107
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,725
OT and robotics, not just walls.

108
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,585
Second, data driven validation builds
confidence for large scale use.

109
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:53,075
Third multifunctional design, reduce
cost, and simplifies the procurement.

110
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:58,295
And finally, real world adoption
shows this technology isn't

111
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:00,725
futuristic, it's happening right now.

112
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,725
So how do we carry this momentum forward?

113
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,450
The future of connected environments
depends on material innovations.

114
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,850
Smart non surface from foundation of
intelligent buildings enable wireless

115
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,730
communications, embedded sensors,
and sustainable compliance that older

116
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,760
material can't catch or can match.

117
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,330
In short, material engineering
is infrastructure engineering

118
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,860
for connected ages.

119
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,060
I hope this session gives
you a new perspective on how

120
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,680
material science connects.

121
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,145
With robotics and
automations sustainability.

122
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,785
Thank you for your time and attention.

123
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:39,575
Okay.
