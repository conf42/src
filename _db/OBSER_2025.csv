No,deep dive,Vaibhav Fanindra Mahajan,,,,,,RAG Beyond Chatbots: Transforming Customer Support with Observable Intelligence,"This presentation reveals how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is fundamentally transforming customer support operations, with implementing organizations achieving up to 40% improvements in first-contact resolution rates, 35% reductions in average handling time, and 25-point increases in Net Promoter Scores.

Unlike traditional AI chatbots constrained by static knowledge bases requiring multi-day update cycles, RAG systems represent a paradigm shift by dynamically retrieving information from enterprise knowledge sources before generating responses—with observable knowledge updates in near real-time. Our analysis across enterprise deployments demonstrates RAG systems reducing agent escalation rates by over 60% while expanding support coverage to 85%+ of total inquiries.

We'll explore RAG's observable advantages with precise metrics: 95% reduction in hallucinations when properly implemented, 72% decrease in knowledge maintenance costs through dynamic integration without manual updates, 43% improvement in contextual understanding across multi-turn conversations (reducing conversation length), and measurable knowledge transfer efficiency to human agents (improving agent satisfaction by 38%).

The presentation explores implementation requirements through an observability lens, examining how organizations achieving the highest ROI focused on knowledge base instrumentation and monitoring. Companies with properly structured and observable repositories demonstrated 3.5x higher retrieval accuracy than those using unprocessed document collections. We'll conclude with emerging trends in the observability space, including multimodal RAG systems showing 57% improvement for visually-oriented support issues and proactive support capabilities reducing ticket creation by up to 30%.

This data-driven exploration equips customer experience leaders with actionable insights into how observable RAG architectures can transform support operations while significantly reducing operational costs and creating sustainable competitive advantage.

This paper examines the root causes of rising logging expenses (e.g., unstructured data, over-retention) and presents a framework for cost optimization without compromising observability. We evaluate three key strategies: (1) sampling (head- and tail-based) to reduce volume, (2) filtering to eliminate low-value logs (e.g., health checks), and (3) tiered storage (hot/cold) to align retention with access needs. Furthermore, we compare open-source alternatives (Grafana Loki, SigNoz) to commercial solutions (Datadog, Elastic Cloud), highlighting trade-offs in cost, scalability, and functionality. A case study demonstrates how structured logging and pipeline optimizations reduced costs by 60% for a mid-sized enterprise. The paper concludes with best practices for implementing these strategies, emphasizing the importance of context-aware logging and vendor-agnostic tooling.
