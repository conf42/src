,No,cloud,Himaja Sabbineni,Senior Software Engineer,Expedia Group,,,,"Microservices and API Design: Best Practices for Scalable, Agile, and Resilient Systems","Microservices architecture and API design are foundational to building scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems in today’s fast-paced technological landscape. By deconstructing complex applications into small, independent services, microservices offer enhanced agility and scalability. APIs serve as the communication bridges between these microservices, ensuring seamless interactions and data exchange. According to a 2020 report by the O'Reilly Media, 67% of organizations are adopting microservices to streamline application development, reduce deployment times, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Effective microservices design begins with clearly defining bounded contexts using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), ensuring each service focuses on a specific business function and avoids overlapping responsibilities. In addition, 76% of companies favor independent deployment for each microservice, allowing teams to update, scale, and troubleshoot services without affecting others. Data isolation, with each service having its own database, is key to maintaining loose coupling and preventing cascading failures. By following error handling patterns like circuit breakers and retries, teams can ensure resilient systems that remain operational during partial failures.

For APIs, following REST or GraphQL best practices enhances system flexibility. REST is perfect for simplicity and broad compatibility, while GraphQL excels in dynamic data queries for complex use cases. API versioning ensures backward compatibility, while adopting tools like Swagger or OpenAPI facilitates effective documentation, reducing friction for developers. With security at the forefront, enforcing HTTPS, authentication mechanisms, and input validation prevents breaches and vulnerabilities. Additionally, optimizing performance with strategies like caching, pagination, and gRPC guarantees faster, more efficient services.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/himaja-sabbineni-b71344102/,,,,Himaja Sabbineni - Conf42 Golang 2025.pdf,Himaja Sabbineni_golang.png,https://youtu.be/TsNIarMy21M,"microservices,api",

We'll dive into our technical architecture, showcasing how Go microservices efficiently orchestrate TensorFlow workflows, resulting in dramatic reductions in pneumonia diagnosis time while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Our healthcare IoT implementation demonstrates how Go-powered services process multiple data points per second with minimal latency, achieving exceptional accuracy in vital sign monitoring.

The presentation addresses critical implementation challenges, including how we used Go's robust security libraries to implement privacy-preserving techniques that substantially reduce data breach risks. We'll share our validation framework built in Go that incorporates multiple performance parameters, achieving high confidence intervals in system reliability metrics.

We'll discuss how our Go-based architecture delivered significant economic impact, with our AI-driven clinical decision support systems reducing annual operating costs per facility and decreasing diagnosis time. The results show improved patient outcomes, with medication compliance rates increasing dramatically and hospital readmission rates decreasing substantially for chronic condition patients.
