No,testing,Bandanawaz Mulla,Senior Manager Platform Strategy,Health Care Service Corporation · Full-time,,,,Prompt Engineering Healthcare Compliance: Automating 102 Benefits for 2M+ Members,"When CMS mandated Medicare Advantage supplemental benefit reporting in 2024, we faced an unprecedented data challenge: consolidating 102 benefit types from more than ten disparate systems for two million members. This presentation reveals how prompt engineering and AI-assisted development accelerated our solution delivery.

Our approach leveraged prompt engineering across the entire development lifecycle. We used large language models (LLMs) to rapidly prototype ETL logic for complex healthcare data transformations, generate SQL for dimensional modeling of our health event data mart, and create comprehensive test scenarios that covered edge cases in benefit utilization patterns. Carefully crafted prompts helped us navigate HIPAA compliance requirements, translating regulatory language into technical specifications and generating audit logging frameworks.

The AWS-based solution (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS) achieved 100% on-time federal reporting while establishing our organization as a compliance leader. More significantly, our prompt engineering strategy reduced development time by 40%, allowing focus on strategic challenges such as converting compliance data into member communication triggers for unused benefits and building reusable components for future regulatory initiatives.

Key lessons include designing prompts that balance healthcare domain specificity with technical precision, iterating on AI-generated code to meet strict security standards, and using LLMs to bridge communication gaps between clinical, technical, and business stakeholders. We transformed a federal mandate into a single source of truth that eliminated redundant processing and enabled data-driven benefit decisions.

Attendees will learn practical prompt engineering techniques for regulated industries, strategies for AI-assisted architecture in complex integrations, and methods to accelerate compliance-driven solution delivery.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/bandanawaz-mulla-b1307820/,,,,Bandanawaz Mulla - Conf42 Prompt Engineering 2025.pdf,Bandanawaz Mulla_prompt.png,https://youtu.be/6GAzUPlgjM0,"healthcare,cloud,solutions",
