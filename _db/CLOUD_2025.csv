No,ai,Praveen Payili,Senior Data Engineer,Horizonsoft Solutions,,,,Leveraging AI-Driven Innovation for Enhanced Food Delivery Operations,"The rapid growth of the online food delivery industry, valued at USD 189.7 billion in 2021 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.8% through 2030, has ushered in significant technological advancements, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming operations. This presentation explores the integration of AI technologies within a leading food delivery platform, focusing on four key innovations: SafeChat+, AI-powered voice ordering systems, machine learning (ML) infrastructure, and data engineering applications. These innovations have optimized order processing, delivery route efficiency, and customer service, resulting in a 42% reduction in order processing time and a 39% improvement in route optimization.

AI-enabled systems, processing millions of orders daily, have increased operational efficiency, with voice ordering AI reducing call handling time by 37% while improving upselling success by 27%. Moreover, machine learning-driven demand forecasting has decreased food waste by 28%, highlighting the system’s ability to balance operational demand with inventory management. SafeChat+, an AI-powered communication safety solution, has increased platform safety with a 63% reduction in communication-related disputes and a 71% improvement in driver satisfaction.

Additionally, leveraging AI for real-time decision-making has significantly reduced delivery times by 31% and improved resource utilization by 44%. By implementing a hybrid human-AI collaboration framework, the platform has achieved an 87% customer satisfaction rate in automated customer service, handling up to 2,000 queries per minute during peak periods.

This session will demonstrate how the hybridization of AI and human oversight can solve scalability, performance, and security challenges, while enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency. It lays the foundation for future innovations in food delivery and similar service-based industries.

With the global serverless computing market projected to reach $36.84 billion by 2028, its adoption is accelerating across industries. However, as serverless workloads continue to grow, so does their environmental impact. Data centers already account for 1% of global electricity consumption, and energy-efficient serverless computing has become a critical research area.

This talk explores the intersection of energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness in serverless computing, presenting innovative strategies for workload optimization, energy-aware autoscaling, and green energy integration. By leveraging predictive scaling algorithms, organizations can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% while maintaining performance. Hardware-software co-design, including ARM-based processors, has demonstrated 30% higher energy efficiency in serverless workloads. Additionally, optimized function chaining and data-aware orchestration can cut energy costs by 25% by minimizing redundant data transfers.

The session will also discuss cutting-edge energy-aware pricing models, where carbon-aware serverless pricing could incentivize up to 50% reduction in energy waste. Real-world case studies will highlight how organizations have achieved cost reductions of up to 60% through dynamic serverless resource allocation and energy profiling tools. Attendees will gain insights into standardized benchmarking methodologies, the challenges of multi-tenant energy measurement, and the need for regulatory compliance in sustainable cloud computing.

As organizations seek to balance cost, performance, and environmental responsibility, this session will provide actionable insights into designing serverless applications that are not only cost-effective but also carbon-conscious, setting the stage for the next era of sustainable cloud computing.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/neetu-gangwani/,,,,Neetu Gangwani - Conf42 Cloud Native 2025.pdf,Neetu Gangwani_cloud.png,https://youtu.be/zQcu1zP2wdM,"cost-optimized,serverless",

No,security,FNU Parshant,,Arm Ltd,,,,Securing Tomorrow’s Hardware: Dual-State Models in the AI Era,"Modern hardware security designs now embrace a dual-state model that segregates trusted operations from general-purpose tasks—a strategy that is even more vital with AI's rapid evolution. AI accelerates data processing and decision-making, demanding specialized hardware while amplifying potential vulnerabilities. As systems incorporate high-speed accelerators and expanded data pipelines, the risk of attacks increases, making robust, integrated security essential.

To counter these threats, systems partition their address space into secure and non-secure regions, enforced by dedicated hardware registers and controllers. A secure boot process, leveraging cryptographic signatures and hash functions, verifies firmware and software integrity before system operation, ensuring that only authenticated code executes. This trusted foundation is critical in AI environments, where any tampering could compromise sensitive models and data.

Once operational, continuous runtime integrity checks monitor for anomalies, such as unusual memory access patterns or execution behaviors. AI-driven anomaly detection further enhances vigilance, identifying subtle signs of intrusion in real time. Hardware-level boundary markers and fine-grained access controls isolate secure processes, ensuring that even if non-secure applications are breached, critical functions remain protected.

The evolution of AI has significantly heightened the demand for these security measures. AI systems depend on vast datasets and intricate algorithms, making them attractive targets for sophisticated attacks. Regular self-tests and periodic validations confirm that secure regions remain uncompromised, building trust in AI-driven decision-making systems. This layered security strategy not only defends intellectual property and sensitive data but also underpins the resilient operation of next-generation technology in an increasingly connected world.",,,,,FNU Parshant - Conf42 Cloud Native 2025.pdf,FNU Parshant_cloud.png,https://youtu.be/Kb77GEqw_6A,"securing,hardware",
