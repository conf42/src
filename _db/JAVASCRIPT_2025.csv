Yes,,Aleksandr Tkachenko,Senior Software Engineer,Playtech,,,,Let Your Browser Take a Breather with a Scheduler.yield(),"Modern web applications often overload the browser’s main thread, causing sluggish interfaces and poor responsiveness. This talk explores how JavaScript’s single-threaded execution model contributes to that problem, and how the new `scheduler.yield()` API offers a clean, effective way to give control back to the browser without breaking your code flow. We’ll walk through the limitations of traditional approaches, introduce task prioritization with `scheduler.yield()`, and show practical examples of how to make apps feel faster and more responsive. By the end, you’ll know how to let your browser take a breather, and your users will feel the difference.
