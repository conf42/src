Yes,,,,,,,,,AI Is Coming For Our Secrets - DevSecOps 2024 Panel Discussion,"Every company relies on software credentials, or secrets, to access critical systems. However, with generative AI making these secrets easier to steal, the risks are skyrocketing. Hackers are more motivated than ever to exploit these vulnerabilities. It's time to rethink how you protect your secrets.

Join the discussion with the Doppler team: [Chandler Mayo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandlermayo/) (Senior Developer Advocate), [Amber Britton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arbritton123/) (Head of Go To Market), [Adam Meehan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammeehan1/) (Sales Team) and [Nic Manoogian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmanoogian/) (Head of Engineering).",https://youtu.be/LQriMbqEWsM,,,,,DevSecOps_2024_Panel_Discussion.png,https://youtu.be/LQriMbqEWsM,"panel,discussion",
,Yes,,Lukasz Karwacki,Security Solution Architect (Edge Network),Gcore,,,,Comprehensive protection for Infrastructure and Web Applications: Key Differences and Strategies,"In today’s complex threat landscape, safeguarding web applications and infrastructure requires an integrated security approach. Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) solutions are critical for defending against sophisticated application layers. However, without robust DDoS protection, organizations remain vulnerable to high-volume attacks that can cripple their infrastructure and render applications inaccessible.This presentation explores why combining WAAP with DDoS protection is essential for comprehensive security. Attendees will learn how this dual approach ensures both application-layer and network-layer resilience and minimizes risks. Case studies and actionable strategies will highlight how businesses can achieve a unified, scalable defense against modern cyber threats in 2025.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-karwacki-6153a81b2/,,,,Lukasz Karwacki - Conf42 DevSecOps 2024.pdf,Lukasz Karwacki_devsecops.png,https://youtu.be/L8IBGQvNDo8,"protection,Infra,web,apps",
