1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,030
My name is Ram Krishna.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,989
I'm working in a medical
as a solution architect.

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:12,339
Today I'm going to present a reactive to
pre predict to transform, transforming

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,674
medical device reliability through
Secure, secure I architecture.

5
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:22,674
Okay, so the traditional approaches
whenever healthcare oration typically

6
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:27,755
responds to the medical devices
failure after they occur in any

7
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:32,535
medical failures that is leading to the
downtime and the delayed diagnostics

8
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,565
and increase the operational cost.

9
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:41,595
So this rare two parum creates a
inefficiency in a resource allocation

10
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,165
and impacts the patient's care delivery.

11
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:49,605
So our vision is okay, is a data
driven predictive maintenance.

12
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,955
So that means, so the reactive
system so we'll fix that.

13
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:56,375
Any medical device values, whenever
it is phase, then we'll apply the fix.

14
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,995
And also it's a schedule maintenance.

15
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:04,050
Whereas our reactive processes, predictive
processes is a datadriven intervention

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,230
and also automated optimization.

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,650
So that means we're transforming
the react to responses to prior two.

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,820
So through IT enabled strategies
and anticipate failures before

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,430
they impact on clinical operations.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,980
The Secure iot Architecture
Foundation is completely like

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,650
completed in three components.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,280
One is cloud platform, and so
here we are using a very zero

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
trust security principles.

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,820
We are using MQ TT and HGTP protocols.

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,660
So these two protocols you'll use
the transfer the data from medical

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,800
devices to the cloud computing.

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,270
So then once, so we have, we transfer
the data, then we do the edge computing.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,660
That means we'll apply the
local pre-processing to reduce

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,790
the transmission volumes while
detecting a critical anomalies.

30
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,060
And third one is HIPAA compliance.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,840
So that means, so this is a
mutual transport layer, security

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,130
authentication with certificate
rotation and real time revocations.

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,850
So that pipeline of architecture
is in in five steps.

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,290
One is a device telemetry.

35
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,759
So that means we are continuously
monitoring operational parameters

36
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,319
from the diagnostics devices.

37
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,709
And local analysis and filtering to
identify the critical patterns and

38
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,689
anomalies in that, the edge processing.

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,069
And we securely transport the data from
transfer to the, from medical devices,

40
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,609
the cloud computing infrastructure,
using a security protocol that

41
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,039
is three TPS and MQD protocols.

42
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,789
And we'll store that in the time series.

43
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,719
So then we'll optimize the database
for the telemetry data and advanced

44
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,639
analysis for further processing.

45
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,899
And finally analytics engine.

46
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,149
So there we dub the my machine learning
models to generate predictive insights

47
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,679
and maintenance recommendations.

48
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:56,409
So the zero trust implementation
is a mutual TLS authentication

49
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,659
for all device communications.

50
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,950
So certificate rotation schedules
with the automated management.

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,739
So that means we will automatically
roll out the certifications on schedule

52
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,269
basis for the each medical device.

53
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,359
And real time revocations, that means
for the, any compromise credentials.

54
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,869
So that means if you feel like if
you suspect anything which is not

55
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:21,359
working, then we will revoke that
security certifications and under in

56
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,159
a real time revocations capabilities.

57
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,769
And last one is we also do the audit
trialing for the compliance reporting.

58
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,919
So whenever you make any changes
on the medical devices, and we

59
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,219
do have a documentation for the
further the documentation for the

60
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,199
auditing added trail for the further
the processing and reporting.

61
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,509
So the machine learning development
is the feature engineering.

62
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,749
So that means we'll transform the raw
telemetry data into meaningful predictive

63
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:49,164
indicators using a signal processing,
static statistical analysis, and

64
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:51,054
domain specific knowledge integration.

65
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,909
And also we have a class
imbalance handling.

66
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:58,244
So address the unique challenge of
rare failures, events in your medical

67
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:02,589
device, data sets through specialized
sampling and weighing techniques.

68
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,349
And explainable predictions.

69
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,679
So we develop the in interpretable
models that meets regulatory

70
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,369
requirements for software as a medical
device into a controlled healthcare

71
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,399
environment, continuous learning.

72
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:17,159
So that incorporated the
technicians feedbacks and adapt

73
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,479
to revolving the device behavior
patterns for further improvement

74
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,489
prediction accuracy over the time.

75
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:28,459
So the feature engineering processes is a
signal processing, so we will extract the

76
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,549
meaningful patterns from raw sensor data
through a frequency analysis, filtering

77
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:41,179
and transformation techniques and static
analysis drive key metrics including

78
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:47,059
trends, variance and correlation patterns
that indicate device health status.

79
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:52,959
And domain knowledge that is integrate
a clinical and engineering expertise

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,849
to identify the features which
proven diagnostic significances.

81
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,609
So the main key improvements are,
or optimize the resource location

82
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,079
through predictive analysis.

83
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,639
So based on the analysis, and we can
optimize the resource allocation for that.

84
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:13,724
Fixes and automatic ticketing
system integrates a maintenance

85
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,454
and workflow streamlines the
maintenance of the workflows.

86
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,904
So whenever device can use occurs,
our workflows will trigger to

87
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:23,294
create the automating of system
automated out the ticketing system.

88
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:26,294
And also we develop the
realtime dashboards.

89
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:30,434
So visualizations enable that
data driven decision making.

90
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:35,294
So that means we can predict, add
the based on the data visualizations

91
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:39,744
and so we develop the reports and
dashboards the stake, enhance the

92
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:43,224
stakeholder communication across the
clinical and the technical teams.

93
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,604
So that is the major key improvements
with benefits of this solution.

94
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:48,344
Okay.

95
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,059
So regulatory compliance framework.

96
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,729
So we also have a FDA requirements.

97
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,089
So address software as a medical
device, regulations with the

98
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,319
comprehensive validation and
verification protocols details.

99
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,579
Maintain a complete documentation
of all the system activities,

100
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:11,219
predictions and maintenance actions
for the compliance reporting.

101
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,959
And we also have a quality management,
so we'll integrate with the existing

102
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,179
quality management system framework to
ensure continuous co and accessibility.

103
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,259
So we implement the
workflow in the five steps.

104
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,279
One is the assessment.

105
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,029
In this section, what we'll do is we
evaluate the existing infrastructures

106
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,809
and identify the critical
devices for the iot integration.

107
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,244
And second bit is
architecture data design.

108
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:40,314
So we love the secure iot architecture
with the HIPA compliances and

109
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,694
the Zero trust principles.

110
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,219
Okay, so then pilot development
deploy the edge computing units and

111
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:51,059
establish a secure data pipelines
for the initial device plate.

112
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,419
So that means we will identify,
we will roll out this initially

113
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,959
only for the thousand devices and
not for the, we don't roll out for

114
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,849
the major clinicals and hospitals.

115
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,629
And then once we roll out the
solution, then we'll our model

116
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,559
training, we'll collect the tele
data and develop a predictive models.

117
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:12,364
With the validation protocols
and scale and optimize, expand to

118
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:17,044
full device fleet and implement
continuous learning mechanisms.

119
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:22,614
So the future innovations and reaches
directions is embedded diagnostics,

120
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:27,144
so meme sensors which resides in
the medical devices so that sensors

121
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:31,134
integrate directly into the device
for enhanced monitoring capabilities

122
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,084
and rail them health assessment.

123
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,299
Okay.

124
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,209
Based on that MIM sensor data, we
will do the assessments for each

125
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,999
medical device and federated learning.

126
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,159
So privacy preserving analytics
across distributed device plates

127
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,769
without a centralizing sensitive data.

128
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,069
And these still twin technologies.

129
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,609
So we develop the simulation
based on the maintenance planning,

130
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:57,359
using a virtual replicas for the
scenario testing and optimization.

131
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:01,989
So we have some simulators, exactly
a medical device, so where we

132
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,429
can use for the, for testing.

133
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,979
And we can see, we can capture the,
all the test scenarios and also you

134
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,689
can use for the training purposes.

135
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,384
And the success factor says
the stakeholder engagement

136
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:16,894
across the clinical, technical,
and administrative teams.

137
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:17,614
Okay.

138
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:21,124
Comprehensive to training programs
for maintenance personal and

139
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:26,034
clinicians, the clear communication
of benefits and measurable outcomes.

140
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:32,124
Phase rollout implementation
approach to minimum disruption.

141
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:37,404
Okay, so continuous feedback loops to
refine predictive models and workflows.

142
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:38,574
Okay?

143
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:42,264
These are the major success
factors with our solution.

144
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:46,604
Key takeaways for implementation is
security first, so we'll established

145
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:50,864
a robust zero trust architecture
with the P compliances before

146
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:55,664
collecting any patient adjustment
adjacent data from medical devices.

147
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:57,754
Start smaller scale smart.

148
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,554
So begin with the A pilot deployment.

149
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:03,024
As I mentioned, we roll out for the
small and local hospitals like, hundreds

150
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:08,484
and thousands on critical devices to
validate the models and demonstrate

151
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:10,134
value before enterprise rollout.

152
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,084
So then we can test for so
before rolling out, so we'll

153
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,714
demonstrate on the local clinicals.

154
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:18,674
MS continues learning that third one.

155
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:22,154
So every we year, we built the
feedback mechanisms that incorporate

156
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:27,944
technicians expertise and adopt models
to evolving device behavior patterns.

157
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:28,834
Okay.

158
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,744
And last one is focus on
operational integrations.

159
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:37,884
Ensure predictive insights translate into
a actionable workflows through automated

160
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,864
ticketing and decision support systems.

161
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,444
So as I mentioned, whenever device
value occurs, our workflows will

162
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:47,204
trigger, require automated ticketing
system and will use the two solution.

163
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,784
Based on the, model what we developed.

164
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:53,714
So our models will trigger and identify
the air predict to a solution to

165
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:56,284
the technicians for the, device fix.

166
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:59,484
So that is the end of my presentations.

167
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:04,454
If you have any questions feel
free to ask here, and thank you so

168
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,804
much for giving me the opportunity.
