Yes,,Benjamin Wilms,Co-Founder & CEO,Steadybit,,,,How to Build a Reliable System Under Unpredictable Conditions,"Modern businesses depend on the stability and reliability of their systems. Downtime is costly, and outages are inevitable—what matters is how we prepare for and respond to them. With the complexity of today’s microservice architectures, understanding and assessing risk at any given moment is critical. Engineering teams must strike a balance between delivering new features and maintaining system resilience. But systems are more than just technology—they are a dynamic interplay of multiple elements: infrastructure, teams, people, and processes. Are these components perfectly aligned? Does everyone know what to do when things go wrong? In this session, we will put the system to the test. Through live experiments, we’ll uncover hidden risks and explore strategies to build resilience at every level. You'll walk away with actionable insights to strengthen both your technology and your teams, ensuring reliable service delivery even in unpredictable conditions.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-wilms/,@MrBWilms,,,Benjamin Wilms - Conf42 Chaos Enginering 2025.pdf,Benjamin Wilms_chaos.png,https://youtu.be/I4ONmOzUMD4,"reliable,system,unpredictable",
