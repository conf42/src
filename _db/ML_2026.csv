No,main,Murthy Chandrapaty,"Principal Engineer, Architect",Adobe,Chakravarthy Kalva,Senior Product Manager,Adobe,Beyond Send-Time Optimization: From Prediction to AI-Driven Decisioning in B2C Marketing,"Send-time optimization has traditionally been treated as a prediction problem—using historical data to determine when customers are most likely to engage. While effective in simpler environments, this approach falls short in today’s B2C landscape, where customers receive multiple messages across channels, campaigns compete for attention, and engagement is constrained by fatigue, regulations, and business priorities. In this context, selecting the “best” send time is no longer just a modeling task, but a decision-making challenge.

This session reframes send-time optimization as an AI-driven decision system that combines machine learning and artificial intelligence in complementary ways. Machine learning provides predictive signals such as engagement likelihood and time-based patterns, while AI adds reasoning, orchestration, and goal awareness—resolving tradeoffs between urgency, relevance, frequency, and customer experience in real time.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthychandrapaty/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chakravarthy-kalva/,,,Murthy Chandrapaty & Chakravarthy Kalva_ml.png,,"timeseries,forecasting,demand",
