Yes,,Rajeshwari Sah,Machine Learning Engineer,Apple,,,,Orchestrating Agentic State Machines with LangGraph: Learnings from Automating clinical documentation,"Medical documentation continues to be one of the biggest productivity bottlenecks in healthcare. In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to design and deploy an agentic AI medical scribe that transforms real or simulated doctor–patient conversations into structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes.

Using LangGraph, we’ll build a dynamic, multi-agent system where each node performs a specialized task and communicates through a shared memory graph:

Transcription Agent - converts clinical dialogue into text using a speech-to-text model.

Information Extraction Agent - identifies key clinical entities such as symptoms, vitals, and diagnoses.

Summarization Agent - generates structured SOAP notes and validates internal consistency through a self-reflective loop.


Attendees will see how LangGraph enables state-aware orchestration and real-time coordination between these agents, how to integrate retrieval grounding using clinical ontologies (ICD-10, SNOMED), and how to measure performance with F1, ROUGE-L, and readability metrics.

By the end, participants will deploy a lightweight, production-ready prototype that demonstrates how agentic workflows can automate time-consuming documentation tasks, while remaining transparent, auditable, and compliant.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwari-sah-881a6699/,,,,Rajeshwari Sah - Conf42 Machine Learning 2026.pdf,Rajeshwari Sah_ml.png,https://youtu.be/JKyT_8Def2c,"labeling,annotation,quality",

No,marketing,Murthy Chandrapaty,"Principal Engineer, Architect",Adobe,Chakravarthy Kalva,Senior Product Manager,Adobe,Beyond Send-Time Optimization: From Prediction to AI-Driven Decisioning in B2C Marketing,"Send-time optimization has traditionally been treated as a prediction problem—using historical data to determine when customers are most likely to engage. While effective in simpler environments, this approach falls short in today’s B2C landscape, where customers receive multiple messages across channels, campaigns compete for attention, and engagement is constrained by fatigue, regulations, and business priorities. In this context, selecting the “best” send time is no longer just a modeling task, but a decision-making challenge.

This session reframes send-time optimization as an AI-driven decision system that combines machine learning and artificial intelligence in complementary ways. Machine learning provides predictive signals such as engagement likelihood and time-based patterns, while AI adds reasoning, orchestration, and goal awareness—resolving tradeoffs between urgency, relevance, frequency, and customer experience in real time.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthychandrapaty/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chakravarthy-kalva/,,Murthy Chandrapaty & Chakravarthy Kalva - Conf42 Machine Learning 2026.pdf,Murthy Chandrapaty & Chakravarthy Kalva_ml.png,https://youtu.be/KYXzvCGlfSM?si=_dSvuH73yvhEXBPd,"decisioning,b2c,marketing",
