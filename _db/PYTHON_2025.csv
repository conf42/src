No,cloud,Harikrishna Madathala,Senior Customer Engineer,Microsoft,,,,Designing a Robust Architecture for Seamless and Efficient Migration from On-Premises Infrastructure to Azure Cloud,"In today’s digital era, migrating on-premises infrastructure to the cloud has become a strategic priority for organizations seeking to leverage scalability, cost efficiency, and operational flexibility. Among various cloud providers, Microsoft Azure offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services that enable organizations to seamlessly transition their workloads, applications, and data to the cloud. However, a successful migration requires more than just shifting resources—it demands the design of a robust, scalable, and secure architecture that ensures minimal disruption, optimized resource utilization, and alignment with business goals.

This presentation, ""Designing a Robust Architecture for Seamless and Efficient Migration from On-Premises Infrastructure to Azure Cloud,"" explores key considerations for creating a migration strategy that balances performance, security, and cost-efficiency. We will delve into Microsoft’s Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), a structured methodology that guides organizations through planning, readiness, adoption, and optimization phases. Additionally, we will highlight the Azure tools—such as Azure Migrate, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Database Migration Service, and Azure Security Center—that support the migration process by automating tasks, enhancing security, and ensuring business continuity.

By the end of the session, participants will gain actionable insights into designing a robust architecture that not only simplifies migration but also prepares their organizations for the dynamic, cloud-driven future. This presentation is suitable for IT professionals, cloud architects, and decision-makers involved in cloud adoption and migration initiatives.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikrishna-madathala-178a5315/,,,,,Harikrishna Madathala_python.png,,"migration,on-premises,azure",
