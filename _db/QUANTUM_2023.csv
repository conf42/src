no,getting started,Archit Srivastava,Data Analyst,Hewlett Packard Enterprise | AiQyaM,,,,In Ignotis : An introduction to Quantum Computing & Astrophysics,"Curiosity, the only thing that has led humanity to constantly evolve, learn about it's surrounding, nature, how things are related and how to improve ourselves. Curiosity has led humanity to develop and discover things unimaginable to an ordinary brain, has led to develop the unthinkable and unleash the true potential of human brain in astonishingly tough times.

This presentation, the topic is another child of curiosity, an intersection between two very vast domains of science, Astrophysics and Quantum Physics. The amalgamation of these two fields, can lead us to paths unknown, ignotus. The more we dive deep into it, the more we realise that it was just, a meagre scratch on the surface of the unknown. The relm where things make and break the boundaries of physics that we are currently aware of. 

The presentation will dive into the field exploring Quantum Gravity and how Quantum Computing can be a boon to the research going on in the field. We'll explore the research done and the current works going on in, and around globe and the potential this topic has which will help open a completely new world of possibilities and potentially leading us to the Theory of Everything.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/architsrivastava3115/,,,,,archit srivastava_quantum.png,,"in Ignotis,introduction,astrophysics",
no,ai,Prateek Jain,Quantum Computing Researcher,Fractal,,,,Quantum computing and Generative AI in Life science ,"In molecular research, simulation & design of molecules are key areas with significant implications for drug development, material science, and other fields. Current classical computational power falls inadequate to simulate any more than small molecules, let alone protein chains on hundreds of peptide. Therefore these experiments are done physically in wet-lab, but it takes a lot of time & not possible to examine every molecule due to the size of the search area, tens of billions of dollars are spent every year in these research experiments. Molecule simulation & design has lately advanced significantly by machine learning models, A fresh perspective on the issue of chemical synthesis is provided by deep generative models for graph-structured data. By optimising differentiable models that produce molecular graphs directly, it is feasible to avoid costly search techniques in the discrete and huge space of chemical structures. But these models also suffer from computational limitations when dimensions become huge and consume huge amounts of resources. Quantum Generative machine learning in recent years have shown some empirical results promising significant advantages over classical counterparts.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratjz/,@pratjz,,,,prateek jain_quantum.png,,"generative,ai,life,science ",
