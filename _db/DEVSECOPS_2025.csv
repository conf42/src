Yes,,Dewan Ahmed,Principal Developer Advocate,Harness,,,,Secure by Default: Building Confidence in AI-Driven Delivery,"The fastest way to break trust in DevSecOps is to automate insecurity at scale. As AI takes a central role in our pipelines, it is time to rethink what ""secure by default"" really means.

In this keynote, Dewan Ahmed will challenge the audience to look beyond vulnerability scanners and compliance gates. He will share a vision for intelligent security by design, where native intelligence within the delivery platform detects not only vulnerable code but risky delivery behavior such as misconfigured environments, suspicious artifact provenance, and drift between source and runtime.

You will walk away with a framework for balancing automation with human oversight and examples from Harness’ work on building verifiable, auditable, AI-native delivery systems. In the new world of DevSecOps, safety is not a step; it is an outcome we continuously learn to improve.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/diahmed/,,,,,Dewan Ahmed_devsecops.png,https://youtu.be/1LKjaIYYqPU,"secure,ai,delivery",

No,security,Safeer C M,Principal Engineer,MoEngage,,,,Understanding SAST Foundations with Open-Source Semgrep,"Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a fundamental practice for securing the software development lifecycle, but its inner workings are often treated as a complex black box. This session peels back those layers, focusing on the core principles of static analysis using the fast, open-source Semgrep engine as our practical guide. We will explore how modern SAST moves beyond simple text searching by parsing code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to understand its true structure and intent.

On that foundation, we will start with Semgrep (semgrep.dev), a fast, open-source SAST engine that matches code shapes across many languages. You’ll learn Semgrep’s minimal building blocks: YAML rules, patterns, and pattern combinators, metavariables and constraints, severity and metadata, and autofix for developer-friendly guidance. We’ll also cover when to switch from simple structural matching to taint mode (sources, sinks, sanitizers) for data-flow findings. Finally, we outline the basics of adopting Semgrep, including running it locally and in CI, as well as starting with community rule packs and testing rules.

Attendees leave with a clear mental model of how SAST works and a practical, open-source starting point to add precise, maintainable code checks to their DevSecOps workflows.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/safeer/,,,,,Safeer C M_devsecops.png,https://youtu.be/_RRV8SY2ED0,"sast,open,source,semgrep",
