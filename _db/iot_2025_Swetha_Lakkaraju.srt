00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,649
My name is Raju and I bring over 18
years of specialized exp experience

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,530
in mainframe based core banking
systems with deep expertise in

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,480
systematics and vision plus products.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,450
Throughout my career, I have worked
ex extensively on core banking

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,890
modernization, credit card processing,
large scale conversions, and high

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,790
availability production support
across major financial institutions.

8
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:30,684
My background includes leading end-to-end
modernization initiatives, designing

9
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:36,624
scalable mainframe to cloud integrations
and delivering complex migration programs.

10
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:40,794
Experience that directly aligns with
today's theme of decoupling legacy

11
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:45,474
banking, modular core strategies that
drive speed, scale, and innovation.

12
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:50,324
With this background, I'm excited to
walk you through the presentation on how

13
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:57,014
modular core strategies microservices API,
firsted design, doing driven architectures

14
00:00:57,014 --> 00:01:02,534
and phased migration can significantly
enhance agility, reside, and long-term

15
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,544
growth for financial institutions.

16
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:04,604
The.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:06,514
Where innovation goes to die.

18
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:11,044
So the biggest challenge for
most banks is the overwhelming

19
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:12,904
dependency on the legacy systems.

20
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:17,134
These systems were built decades ago,
and while they are served the industry

21
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:18,814
well, they have become extremely.

22
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:20,539
Costly and rigid.

23
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,769
A large portion of the IT budgets
is sometimes 60 to 80% is spent

24
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,299
just keeping the systems running.

25
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,149
That means very little funding is left
for innovation or digital transformations.

26
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,169
Legacy architectures also
slow down time to market.

27
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:37,599
Slow down time.

28
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,249
Slow down time to market.

29
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:44,439
Every simple changes requires long
testing cycles, and carries high risk.

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,889
Traditional banks ends up innovating
at a much slower rate compared

31
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,789
to a digital native companies.

32
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,394
They simply can't move fast enough.

33
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:58,704
To compete in a world where new fintechs
are introducing products every few weeks,

34
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:03,864
legacy based banks are often stuck with
release cycles of months or even years.

35
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,194
So the legacy systems becomes
more than a technical burden.

36
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:10,674
It becomes a strategic burden
that limits long-term good.

37
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:16,524
To address these problems, we conducted
extensive research across global

38
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,104
institutions, the research foundation.

39
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:23,214
Our analysis, not theoretical,
it's grounded in global research

40
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:26,184
involving financial institutions
across multiple countries.

41
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:30,144
We studied their modernization
journeys, evaluated performance metrics,

42
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:34,434
and tracked the transformational
outcomes over several years.

43
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,459
Like evidence showed a clear pattern.

44
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:41,184
Institutions that adopted modular
architectures outperformed those that did.

45
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:43,284
We measured speed.

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,009
Cost efficiency, innovation,
output, digital adoption, and

47
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,809
customer experience improvements.

48
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:54,429
These insights from this research
from the foundation for the strategies

49
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,739
and outcomes I'll share today.

50
00:02:57,369 --> 00:03:01,629
Now, let's look at what happens
when banks move from monolithic

51
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,009
to modular architecture.

52
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:04,949
Legacy systems are typically monolith.

53
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,099
So this means everything
is tightly coupled.

54
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,319
Core banking, payments, customers,
accounts, customer accounts, card

55
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,779
systems, and more like because
everything is interdependent.

56
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,869
A change in one component often requires
updates across the entire system.

57
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,569
That increases risk and slows deployment.

58
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,319
So modular outreaches breakdown
this monolith into separate,

59
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,639
confidential services.

60
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:32,959
Each module handles its own
business capability and can

61
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,249
be updated independently.

62
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,869
This approach enables flexibility.

63
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:40,919
Banks can adapt to new technologies
without rewriting the whole system.

64
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,469
It also enhances reside
issues in one area.

65
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:48,159
Don't bring down the
entire core system overall.

66
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,724
Mod modularization of transforms
overall modularization of.

67
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:56,764
Transforms the way teams works,
or sorry, speeding up delivery

68
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,104
and reducing dependencies.

69
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:03,754
This shift directly improves deployment
and speed and innovation velocity.

70
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:08,674
Deployment velocity deployment
velocity is one of the most significant

71
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:11,854
benefits of modular architectures
like the traditional banks release

72
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:16,084
updates infrequently, sometimes once
per quarter or even once per year.

73
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:20,884
Also without modularization
and mo microservices releases

74
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,584
cycles shrink dramatically.

75
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,994
Like teams can push updates
weekly or even daily.

76
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:30,024
Frequent deployments mean faster
response to customer needs, regulatory

77
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:31,734
changes, and market dynamics.

78
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:35,514
It also encourages experimentation.

79
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:40,464
Banks can test new features on smaller
customer groups, gather feedback

80
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:44,349
and it rate some things that legacy
system make nearly impossible.

81
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:49,914
Faster deployment, faster innovation,
high, higher competitiveness.

82
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:50,754
They all are.

83
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:53,174
Improve speed also translate.

84
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:57,684
From a financial perspective
modernization pay off in several ways.

85
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:01,044
First, total cost of
ownership reduces gradually.

86
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:06,404
Banks less spends less on maintenance
infrastructure and vendors purport.

87
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,064
Second time to market improves,
allowing banks to launch new

88
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:13,904
products faster and capture market
opportunities before competitors.

89
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,534
Third, which modular systems,
multiple teams can work in parallel.

90
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,409
This reduces project timelines
and operational bottlenecks.

91
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:27,559
Fourth, optimized testing and automation,
reduce operational overhead and

92
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,929
increases reliability when combined.

93
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,009
These outcomes delivers millions
in a cost savings and create

94
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,139
room for new revenue streams.

95
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,379
Let's look at the strategies
that successful institutions

96
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,999
adopt to modernize their banks.

97
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,889
There are four strategic pillars
that consistently produce

98
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,809
successful modernization outcomes.

99
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:51,869
First is strangler pattern In
this pattern replaces legacy

100
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,459
components in small increments.

101
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:57,779
Instead of risky big bang migrations,
the old system is gradually replaced

102
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,669
while business operations continue.

103
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,594
Uninterrupted domain driven designs.

104
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:05,594
These are, this ensures that
the technology structure

105
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,064
reflects the business structure.

106
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:10,694
Like clear domain boundaries
allows team to own and evolve

107
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:11,924
their models independently.

108
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,724
API first development APIs access
is standard communication layer,

109
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:20,684
enabling seamless integration with
partners, FinTech and internal systems.

110
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:26,184
A PA fast banks innovate much
faster and unlock new ecosystem.

111
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:30,344
Opportunities, microservices,
architecture, microservices allow

112
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:37,514
fi, fine-grained scaling, flexible
deployments, improved fault isolations.

113
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,864
Each service evolves independently
enabling more agility.

114
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:46,304
These strategies aren't just
theories, they translate into real

115
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,344
operational invest improvements too.

116
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,129
Operational ex excellence.

117
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,299
Through decoupling dec decoupling systems
results in major operational benefits.

118
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,839
Reliability improves because
failures are isolated.

119
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,779
They no longer cascade
across entire system.

120
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,719
Integration defects reduce because
APIs define clear contracts and

121
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,599
expectations, like compliance
becomes faster and simpler.

122
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:16,459
Modular systems require smaller
audit scopes and easier traceability.

123
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,109
When operation stabilizes team
can focus less on firefighting and

124
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:25,939
more on innovation and modernizing
impacts more than operations.

125
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,054
It directly drives revenues,
revenue, and market impact.

126
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:34,514
Modernized banks significantly outperform
legacy banks in revenue growth.

127
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:39,454
They introduce innovative products such
as digital banking, instant payments,

128
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,434
personalized offers much faster.

129
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:45,094
This attracts a larger share of
digital customer, first customers who

130
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:47,134
are fast growing customer segment.

131
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,864
The customer acquisition cost goes down
while customer satisfaction goes up.

132
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:56,424
So the difference in this competitiveness
between modernized and non modernized

133
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:58,554
becomes more obvious year after year.

134
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:05,004
So the questions most leader ask is, does
modernization deliver long term ROIs?

135
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,534
The answer is yes.

136
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,339
That is returns on the investment.

137
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,949
The business case modernization.

138
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,569
Del was strong, ROI, particularly
over three to five years of period

139
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,889
because savings come from reduced
maintenance, lower infrastructure

140
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,349
costs, and optimized workflows.

141
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,709
New revenues come from
digital pro product.

142
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:30,484
API partnerships and
expanded market offerings.

143
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:35,494
Most banks recover their investments
faster than expected because operational

144
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:39,654
savings accumulate quickly and new
capabilities and partners are added.

145
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:44,634
The return continues to grow
exponentially, but modernization does

146
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:48,714
come with such challenges and it is
important to manage them pro proactively.

147
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:52,454
There are four core
challenges institutions face

148
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:53,534
during the modernization.

149
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,484
First is organizational resistance.

150
00:08:55,484 --> 00:09:01,154
People resist change due to fear of
description, skill gaps or uncertainty.

151
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:06,344
Strong communication, leadership,
sponsorship and visible quick help

152
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:09,074
build trust, regulatory constraints.

153
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:10,814
Banks must comply with strict.

154
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:16,129
Regulatory frameworks, so early
engagement with regulators and detailed

155
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:22,129
documentations help reduces compliance
risk, technical complexity, legacy

156
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,479
system often lacks documentations
and have deeply intervened logics.

157
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:30,964
So to overcome this we should have
clear architecture, governance,

158
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:34,444
phased migrations, skill,
developmental residential, clear

159
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:36,664
documentations is re required.

160
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:37,564
Budget.

161
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,584
Budget limitations.

162
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,384
Modernizations are expensive.

163
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:40,894
We know that.

164
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:46,544
But phased execution and re reinvesting
the savings make it more sustainable.

165
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:51,074
With the right foundations, banks
can unlock new innovation potential.

166
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,944
API driven ecosystem advantage.

167
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,704
API driven ecosystems are now
central to modern banking.

168
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:00,254
Like APIs allows banks to
collaborate quickly with

169
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:04,364
fintechs, merchants, government
services and technology partners.

170
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:12,244
This means back can add new capabilities
like digital kc KYC, or loyalty programs

171
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,274
or valids without modifying the code.

172
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:19,144
So API also create better
customer experiences by ensuring

173
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:24,214
consistency across mobile, BA web
branch and call center channels.

174
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:30,244
So this ecosystem driven MO model is what
enables modern banks to innovate rapidly.

175
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:34,544
So to move towards this feature

Modernization roadmap.

178
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:44,304
So a structured modernization roadmap
helps ensure smooth execution.

179
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:49,964
Assessment and strategy starts by
analyzing current architecture, identify

180
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:55,239
pain points, define business outcomes,
and secure leadership alignment early.

181
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,309
Validate, select a small
non-critical domain to modernize.

182
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,929
First, use this phase to build
expertise establish processes

183
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,279
and validate assumptions.

184
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,959
Then scale and optimize.

185
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:12,949
Expand modernization to core domains like
lending, payments, and customer systems.

186
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:18,139
Establish governance, automate testing,
and refined deployment processes.

187
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,959
Ecosystem expansion.

188
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,819
This enables partners, integrations and
build new digital product offerings.

189
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:28,929
This is where the most significant
innovations and revenue growth happens.

190
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:33,219
Ultimately, modernization build
banks that are ready for the future.

191
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:34,904

Competition is tougher.

197
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,444
Regulatory requirements are more complex.

198
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,564
Legacy systems simply cannot
support the speed and flexibility

199
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,154
that modern banking requires.

200
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,724
