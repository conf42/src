This talk is an introduction to shift up paradigm, think of it as an extension of shift left but a culture that only strives in production. Shift up enables an organization identify, and remediate insecure code and address any security gaps within infrastructural stack in seal-healing and iterative manner. To achieve this end state an organization needs to perform defensive dynamic security testing and test configuration, and system failures against A/B units. These exercises helps validate effectiveness of production's layered protection, which is responsible to protect application code and most importantly customer's data. And last but not the least, building capabilities to identify external-facing assets in continuous manner and monitor it through out its existence.

Today, there is a way to rebalance the odds and protect our resources through crowdsourced security and reputation. 

In 2020, our ways of living and working turned completely upside down in a matter of days. We all brought our companies home and our homes in our companies’ systems. Staying connected to our colleagues, friends and family became a critical necessity, which opened the door for hackers to cause disruption and we saw a huge increase of attacks all around the world.

Even though worldwide spending on cybersecurity is predicted to reach $1 trillion in 2021 according to Forbes, the game will still be asymmetrical and all companies will keep being hacked regardless of their security budgets. Expensive security doesn’t mean better security. A new approach is needed and this is why we created CrowdSec.

No,security,Kennedy Torkura,Cyber Security Engineer,Mattermost,,,,Risk-Driven Fault Injection: Security Chaos Engineering for the Fast & Furious,"""The dynamic nature of cloud-native infrastructure requires continuous security mechanisms to effectively detect security threats, especially those with unknown patterns and behavior. This talk proposes Risk-driven Fault Injection (RDFI) techniques to address these
challenges. Essentially, RDFI applies the principles of chaos engineering to cloud security and leverages feedback
loops to execute, monitor, analyze and plan security fault injection campaigns, based on a knowledge-base.

The knowledge-base consists of fault models designed from secure baselines, cloud security best practices, and observations derived during iterative fault injection campaigns. These observations are helpful for
identifying vulnerabilities while verifying the correctness of security attributes (integrity, confidentiality, and
availability). Furthermore, RDFI proactively supports risk analysis and security hardening efforts by sharing
security information with security mechanisms.  We have designed and implemented the RDFI strategies
including various chaos engineering algorithms as a software tool: CloudStrike. 

Several evaluations have
been conducted with CloudStrike against infrastructure deployed on two major public cloud infrastructure:
Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The time performance linearly increases, proportional
to increasing attack rates. Also, the analysis of vulnerabilities detected via security fault injection has been
used to harden the security of cloud resources to demonstrate the effectiveness of the security information
provided by CloudStrike. Therefore, we opine that our approaches are suitable for overcoming contemporary
cloud security issues.

As a result, security is treated as separate from development. Although sponsors have promoted the integration of security practices into all stages of software development, many developers think security is a topic for other engineering fields. Despite having tools such as Snyk and Blackduck, as result developers are missing the benefits they get from their cloud platforms.  

This talk will show the benefits of practicing security chaos engineering [SCE] by empowering developers to leverage the power of security topics directly. [SCE] offers many advantages that include a reduction in remediation costs, disruption to end-users, and improvement of confidence in production systems. In this talk, we are going to show how this practice has helped us to develop a culture based on security between software developers.

Methodology:
* Present the foundation of the software development life cycle.
* Explore the integration of SDLC, resilience, and security using tools such as Snyk and Blackduck.
* Analyze why developers do not include the security topics in their activities.
* Present a novel practice titled Security Chaos Engineering.

Breaking changes are sad. We’ve all been there; someone else changes their API in a way you weren’t expecting, and now you have a live-ops incident you need to fix urgently to get your software working again. Of course, many of us are on the other side too: we build APIs that other people’s software relies on.
There are many strategies to mitigate breaking changes: think SemVer or API versioning, but all rely on the API developer identifying which changes are breaking.

That’s the bit we’ll focus on in this talk: how do you
(a) Get really good at identifying what changes *might* break someone’s integration
(b) Help your API consumers to build integrations that are resilient to these kinds of changes
(c) Release potentially breaking changes as safely as possible",https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-karlin-curtis-a4563920/,@paprikati_eng,,,,ce_lisa.png,https://youtu.be/PPoQSa_6Dko,breaking things

However, realistic perturbations could also come from errors that have naturally happened in production. I would like to share more about how to improve the realism for CE experiments.

During the talk, I would like to share our research work on chaos engineering for system call invocations. I will present a novel fault injection framework for system call invocation errors,  called Phoebe. Phoebe is unique as follows: First, Phoebe enables developers to have full observability of system call invocations. Second, Phoebe generates error models that are realistic in the sense that they mimic errors that naturally happen in production. Third, Phoebe is able to automatically conduct experiments to systematically assess the reliability of applications with respect to system call invocation errors in production. We evaluate the effectiveness and runtime overhead of Phoebe on two real-world applications in a production environment. The results show that Phoebe successfully generates realistic error models and is able to detect important reliability weaknesses with respect to system call invocation errors.

This evolved into thinking what if failover handled as part of the normal running of the system and not only in exceptional situations.

No,deep dive,Mahesh Venkataraman,Managing Director,Accenture,,,,Taming the spatio-temporal-causal uncertainty in Chaos Engineering and Observability,"There are 2 challenges in observability. Uncertainty in prognosis decisions (false+ and false- in failure predictions) and discovering causal connections in diagnosis. We address this by modeling spatio-temporal uncertainty for prognosis& knowledge representation/ graph database for causal diagnosis

Distributed systems are complex and are prone to failures. With more and more enterprises migrating their on-prem systems to cloud, there is also increased risk of failures. These failures often happen owing to unpredictability of production system workload and usage patterns and the consequent emergent response of distributed systems which cannot be easily envisaged during design and implementation. Principles of observability built on three pillars namely, logging, monitoring and metrics attempt to observe the internal state of the system in order to perform prognosis of failure modes and post event failure diagnosis. Observability & chaos engineering techniques are usually combined by conducting planned and thoughtful experiments (inject chaos) and uncovering weaknesses in the systems by analyzing the runtime data of the system (observability).

There are multiple challenges in proactively discovering failure modes during these experiments. First, the logging and monitoring data and their visualization from observability tools is often too overwhelming and voluminous for them to be ‘actionable’. There is data deluge leading to 'data fatigue'. Secondly, there is significant uncertainty in decisions to classify an observed response behavior as either normal or anomalous. Both false positives and false negatives have impact. During a course of series of experiments this uncertainty manifests itself in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The earlier the decision point in time (before the actual expected failure), the more possibility of false alarms and possible ‘alert fatigue’; The later the decision point (i.e closer to the expected failure in time), the less the usefulness of the decision since it is most likely too late to take action. Moreover, the longer the causal chain (spatial separation of original cause and its later effect) the more the uncertainty. We propose to use spatio-temporal models to address this uncertainty in prognosis

Another challenge in prognosis and diagnosis is determining causality and connections between events. Often, with huge amount of observability data, the causal connections between various connected events are not very clear. We propose to use knowledge representation and graph databases to automate discovery of such causal connections

This talk is a tale of few such failures that went right under our noses and what we did to prevent those. The techniques covered range from Heterogenous systems, unordered events, missing correlations, and human errors.

Every time there is a failure, there is a root cause analysis, and there is a vow not to repeat the mistake. I will take some curious shortcomings that I have dealt with in the past decade of my work with Infrastructure systems and the steps we had to undertake to:

1. Isolate
2. Limit the spread
3. Prevent from happening again

## Failure 1 ##
An un-replicated consul configuration results in data loss 25 hours before a countrywide launch. Took a staggering five engineers and 20 hours to find one single line of change.

## Failure 2 ##
A failed, etcD, lock forced us to re-write the whole storage on Consul and hours of migration, only to find out later that it was a clock Issue.

The above Isolation and immediate fixes were painfully long yet doable.

These two practices seem to contradict each other, but is there a way to achieve them both?

## Introduction to Postmortem Culture
* Goal: System shouldn't break in the same way again.
* Growth mindset.
* Learn from mistakes.
* Document everything for posterity!

## What does a postmortem look like?

* All sections for a reason.
* Best practices for each section.
* When does it make sense to write one?

## Psychological safety & Blamelessness
* Postmortems, if not written well can be counterproductive to your culture.
* Why is blamelessness important? The most important?
* Leadership and promoting this culture.
* Celebrating failure!

No,culture,Amir Shaked,Senior VP R&D,PerimeterX,,,,Creating a learning culture,"Building and marinating a five 9s system isn’t just about the tools and technologies. Development culture has a big part in how you keep a system available while scaling it up and supporting more features, users, and locations.

A healthy learning culture, supporting the development, not repairing mistakes, and identifying weak points is another tool in the engineering toolbox.
In this talk, we will discuss how to create a learning culture using debriefs, what to avoid, and how to instill change in an engineering organization.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirshaked/,@amirshaked,,,,ce_amir.png,https://youtu.be/7Sg3etadb4w,learning culture

My current team has grown from 5 to 18 over the past two years whist our application grew from a few thousand to more than a million users. We had our fair share of issues and we always kept our heads in check on how to improve things. Our way of doing postmortems is something I'd like to share with others. Not only because I believe it's helpful, but also, because I love to receive feedback from outside our team.

Postmortems are a well-established way to document the history of a project, especially when things break or don't go as planned. Most teams have a hard time keeping up with it. Among those who do, to get value out of it is also another challenge.
Let me share how my team brought postmortems as part of our process. By not only making it a must-have when handling emergencies but also celebrating it we transformed it as a tool for team bonding. Also, bringing postmortems as an onboarding tool to newcomers. To finish, I'll share two occasions where our postmortems helped us avoid issues and paid themselves.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabriciobuzeto/,@nukdf,,,,ce_fabricio.png,https://youtu.be/tSnQoN6J9R0,"dia de los muertos,postmortems"
