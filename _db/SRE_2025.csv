Yes,,Vijaybhasker Pagidoju,Lead Site Reliability Engineer,,,,,AI-Driven Self-Healing Infrastructure: The Next Evolution of SRE,"Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) has evolved from manual incident response to automated workflows, but AI is unlocking the next major shift—self-healing infrastructure. What if failures could be predicted, prevented, and resolved autonomously, without human intervention?

## Keynote Overview

In this keynote, I will explore:

- **AI-Driven Failure Prediction**  
  How AI is enabling the prediction, prevention, and resolution of failures in infrastructure.

- **Automated Remediation and Self-Adaptive Environments**  
  The shift from reactive alert-based monitoring to predictive, self-healing reliability engineering.

- **Real-World Insights**  
  Case studies and practical examples of how AI is being applied to reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and automate resilience.

- **The Implications of AI-Native SRE**  
  Long-term impacts on engineers and organizations, and how to prepare for this evolution.

As AI continues to transform infrastructure reliability, this talk will outline practical strategies for embracing these advancements and preparing for the next wave of SRE innovation.

This presentation unveils how extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology fundamentally transforms network observability in cloud-native environments. Unlike conventional monitoring approaches that sample or aggregate data, eBPF delivers surgical precision by safely embedding observability directly into the Linux kernel, providing unprecedented visibility without performance penalties.

Through real-world implementation stories, you'll discover how organizations have slashed their mean time to resolution (MTTR) by over 70% for complex networking issues. We'll explore how eBPF enables teams to visualize previously invisible service-to-service dependencies, detect anomalous network behavior in real-time without costly packet captures, implement automated remediation workflows triggered by microsecond-level events, and optimize networking costs by identifying inefficient communication patterns.

This session bridges theory and practice, translating low-level kernel technology into actionable patterns that SREs and platform engineers can implement immediately.
