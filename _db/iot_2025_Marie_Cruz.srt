00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,430
My name is Marie Cruz, and like
many of you, I like to explore

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,330
how technology makes our lives
easier and sometimes greener.

4
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:14,715
When we talk about observability,
we usually talk about it in terms of

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,555
servers, APIs, or distributed systems.

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,575
But in this talk, I'm going to share
with you how I taught my daughter the

7
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:28,185
concepts of monitoring and observability,
and how they kept our house plans alive.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,265
With that said, welcome to STEM
In the Garden, how to monitor

9
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,055
your plans with IOT and GR Cloud.

10
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,615
First things first, who am I?

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:41,295
I work as a senior developer
advocate at Grafana Labs, the company

12
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:46,515
behind open source projects such
as Grafana, Lokey, MiiR, and Tempo.

13
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:52,125
As a senior developer advocate, I
get paid to learn about cool stuff

14
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,985
and share that with the community.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,520
Before transitioning to developer
advocacy, my background has

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,500
always been with software testing.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,370
I'm the co-author of the book
Contract Testing in Action.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,170
So if you wanna learn more about how
contract testing works, please support and

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,720
buy our book by scanning the QR code here.

20
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:17,505
I'm also a mom of two kids and
two dogs, so household life can

21
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,455
be pretty chaotic, but rewarding.

22
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,115
Of course.

23
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:23,115
If you want to know more about
what I do, then you can also

24
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,185
check out testing with marie.com.

25
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,945
Okay, so our story begins with this
plant at first plant, taking care

26
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,255
of a plant looks and sound simple.

27
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,775
Just give it water and light, right?

28
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:40,125
But as many of you know,
plants don't always make it.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,280
I know I'm not the only one
who's done this, so if you're

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,760
watching this virtually, I'd like
to see a quick show of hands.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,100
Who here has ever killed a house plant?

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,260
The reality is that plants die, and it
could be from too much water or not enough

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,540
water, or it could be lack of light, or
maybe the room was too hot or too cold.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,930
So I wanted 2025 to be the
year of no planned casualties.

35
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:15,465
So I team up with my 8-year-old daughter
to look after our plants better,

36
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:23,055
but also I wanted to take this opportunity
to teach her more about STEM subject and

37
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,065
also make the learning fun along the way.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
So we made the beginner level
friendly project that will monitor

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,200
the soil moisture of our plant and
let us know when to water them.

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,859
And I'd like to share all of that
with you in case you also wanna

41
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,984
try a fun IOT project at home.

42
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,385
So as a parent, I wanted her to learn
more about what I do for work all day.

43
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:51,885
I watched the talk online from
the Grafana YouTube channel on

44
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:56,355
how this parent explained Grafana
to his children through IOT home

45
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,905
projects, and I was inspired by it.

46
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:04,035
I wanted to explain tech concepts using
easier to understand terms that are

47
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:06,255
outside the typical technical jargon.

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,350
So for this part of my talk, I want to
focus on how we can explain concepts

49
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,410
such as iot monitoring and observability
to our kids, or even to anyone who

50
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,090
doesn't have much knowledge about it.

51
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,120
I.

52
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,670
Using gardening analogies.

53
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,410
I asked my daughter to imagine that
each plant has a little helper called

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,230
a sensor that is found in the soil, and
that sensor could detect moisture levels

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,329
and inform us when it needed water.

56
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,250
I explained that Internet of
Things or iot is simply just that.

57
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,900
It's a way to connect objects, including
sensors to the internet so they can

58
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,760
monitor, they can communicate, and in
some cases they can even take action

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,010
automatically to make our lives easier.

60
00:03:56,225 --> 00:04:00,905
So I explained to her that monitoring
is a way to keep an eye on our plant.

61
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:06,275
We monitor the soil's, moisture levels,
and if it's dry, we need to water it.

62
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:10,445
We are simply reacting to the
situation and to the plant's.

63
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:15,755
Needs monitoring is useful, but
it's limited because it only

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,704
gives us a yes or no check.

65
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:22,865
If our plant still looks unhealthy
after watering it, then monitoring

66
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,575
can't provide us this answer.

67
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:30,674
Observability, on the other hand,
takes monitoring to the next level.

68
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:36,615
Observability allows us to understand
why our plants held changes over time.

69
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:42,164
For example, does the plant soil moisture
drop during a specific time of day?

70
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:47,145
Do we need to include other factors
such as the room temperature and

71
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:51,135
the humidity into our project
to support those predictions?

72
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,615
Or could it be something else entirely?

73
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:58,965
Could it be that one of our dogs are doing
something that they're not supposed to do?

74
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:05,325
So observability is all about looking
at all our data, identifying patterns

75
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:08,534
over time, and then predicting
what's going to happen next.

76
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,475
So we're being proactive
instead of reactive.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,750
Without observability, we're essentially
walking into a room blindfolded.

78
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,530
We know that the plant is
struggling, but we don't know why.

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,360
Is it because of too much water?

80
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,620
Is it too little?

81
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,930
Or did we choose the wrong light, or is
it because of a change in temperature?

82
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,950
We're essentially guessing
and we're operating on hunches

83
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,750
instead of actual facts.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,060
With observability, this block
box can become a clear box.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,960
If we have signals, we
can then operate on facts.

86
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,340
If we have soil moisture signals,
we can tell when to water the plant.

87
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,870
If we have light level signals, we
can tell if the plant is getting

88
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,370
enough sun and if we have temperature
and humidity signals so we can

89
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,350
tell if the environment is right.

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,640
So.

91
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,110
So with observability, we can
take the signals clearly and take

92
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,360
action before the plant suffers.

93
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,580
So now that I've explained the
key concepts to her, the next

94
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,610
part of this talk is to walk
you through the project setup.

95
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:22,725
As I've mentioned, this is a beginner
level IO OT project, so I'm only going

96
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,035
to cover the soil moisture sensor.

97
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:29,835
If you want a more complete project,
you also need to look at buying other

98
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:35,205
IOT sensors, such as the light sensors,
temperature, and humidity sensors.

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,775
Okay, so on a more technical aspect,
I explained to her that our soil

100
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:46,095
moisture sensor has two metal
farts that are similar to a fork.

101
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,630
When the soil is wet, water helps
electricity flow easily between the

102
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,760
metal parts, and when the soil is
dry, electricity can't flow as well.

103
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,479
The soil moisture sensor process this
information as electrical signals to a

104
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,375
development board like an Arduino or ESP
32, which access the brain of the project.

105
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:15,405
Once the sensor is connected
to the development board, it

106
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:17,865
can have two possible outputs.

107
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:24,105
It can have an analog output where
the output is of a variable number

108
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,415
that depends on the moisture level.

109
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:31,365
So when it's a high number, that means
the soil is dry, and when it's a low

110
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:36,525
number, that means the soil is wet,
or the output can be a digital one

111
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,895
where the output is either high or low.

112
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:45,075
The output is then visualized to
a dashboard using tools such as

113
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:50,445
Grafana so we can track them over
time and make further observations.

114
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:57,525
There were a few bits of hardware that
I had to purchase for this project, so

115
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,595
I had to buy a soil moisture sensor.

116
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:06,135
Of course, I bought an ESP 32, um, S3
dev kit development board to process the

117
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,505
output that we receive from the sensor.

118
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:14,625
I also purchased a red board just to
plug all the components together, some

119
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:20,205
wiring cables to connect the sensor to
the board, and finally, A-U-S-B-C uh,

120
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:22,665
cable to connect the board to my laptop.

121
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:29,325
So for the software part, I also
had to install Arduino IDE, which

122
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:33,495
is an open source software that
you can use to write, edit, and

123
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,475
upload code to a development board.

124
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:40,755
Then I had to sign up to a Grafana
Cloud account and use the free Forever

125
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:42,914
plan to help us get started easily.

126
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,095
So now that we had everything that
we needed, it was time to piece

127
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:53,505
everything together and get to the
most exciting part of the project.

128
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:57,675
So our first step was to
connect the soil moisture sensor

129
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,135
pieces using the DuPont cables.

130
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:06,085
Now, afterwards, we attach the
development board to the breadboard,

131
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:11,815
and while this is an optional step, we
found that in our case, inserting the

132
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:15,745
development board to the breadboard
just made everything more stable.

133
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,270
Next we connected the moisture
sensor to the development board

134
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,520
by connecting the following pins.

135
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:29,550
So we connected the VCC pin to 3.3
volts pin, ground pin to ground

136
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,709
pin, and a open to pin number 11.

137
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,880
So to explain this to her, I said that the
VCC pin is basically the power supply pin.

138
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,530
So I told my daughter that this was
like the plus side of the battery.

139
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,780
This is where the electricity comes from.

140
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,260
The 3.3 volt pin is the power output
on the ESP board that basically

141
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,720
provides 3.3 volts, and then ground
is like the minus side of the battery.

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
So this is where the
electricity goes back.

143
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:06,045
And a O stands for analog
output, so we can connect this

144
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,545
to any of the PIN numbers.

145
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,694
So in this case, we connected
it to PIN number 11.

146
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:17,984
So we finally inserted the moisture
sensor directly into the soil of

147
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:23,805
our plant, and then we connected the
development board to my laptop, and

148
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:28,665
then we connected the development
board to my laptop via A-U-S-B-C cable.

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,770
So once the hardware bits were done,
it was time to write the program.

150
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,250
In rdu, we know IDE, we added support
for our ESP 32 board and added this

151
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,710
very simple program for our first
iteration just to keep things simple so

152
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,570
my daughter could easily follow along.

153
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,940
So let's go over this.

154
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,520
First we simply define the variables
for our sensor pin and sensor value.

155
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:01,425
Within the setup function,
we initialize the serial

156
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,395
communication at a 9,600 board rate.

157
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:09,000
To explain what bot rate
is, uh, to my daughter.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,890
I told her to imagine that she was
talking to her friends and all of

159
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,020
them agreed to speak 9,600 letters
Every second, or every minute or every

160
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,270
hour, if one of them speaks less or
more than 9,600 letters, then the

161
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:28,260
communication won't be clear and they
won't be able to understand each other.

162
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,030
So they have to agree to speak to that.

163
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,910
Um, within the loop function,
we continuously read the analog

164
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,620
value provided by the sensor,
and then if the sensor value

165
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,230
is above 500, the soil is dry.

166
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,680
Otherwise, if the value
is low, the soil is wet.

167
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,850
Then we simply added a delay of five
seconds before taking another reading.

168
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:57,045
After uploading the code to the
development board and then opening up the

169
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:03,255
serial monitor in Arduino, IDE, we saw the
following messages, which is a good sign.

170
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,905
So that means everything is working.

171
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,165
Um, at this point, she thought that
we were finished with the project,

172
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:14,535
but I explained that we can't keep
looking at logs in Arduino, IDE 24 7.

173
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:20,954
So the next part of this project was to
send the sensor values to Prometheus.

174
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:28,635
Now my next challenge was to explain
what Prometheus is to my daughter,

175
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,895
and obviously not this Prometheus.

176
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,880
But this Prometheus.

177
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,199
So I asked her to imagine that there
is a gardener who collects the sensor

178
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:42,900
values continuously and stores all of
them in a toolbox called a database.

179
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:48,540
So Prometheus can store other metrics as
well, but for our example, Prometheus will

180
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,089
collect the sensor values from Arduino.

181
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:57,675
Prometheus database to store the
sensor values is hold a Time series

182
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:02,714
database, so this means that Prometheus
also keeps track of when the values

183
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,964
are stored and stores the timestamp.

184
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:10,605
So this allows us to see a timeline of
how the sensor values change over time.

185
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,605
For us to get the sensor values back
from Prometheus, we massage by speaking

186
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:21,704
its own language, which is called
prom ql or Prometheus Query language.

187
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,405
And a query can look like this.

188
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:27,464
It consists of the metric name.

189
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:32,025
So in this case, the name is called
Soil Moisture, and it can also

190
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,005
have an optional label filter.

191
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:38,175
So the label filter will
return values based on your

192
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,765
filter value that you provide.

193
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:46,305
The easiest way for me to show Prometheus
to her was to set up the Grafana Cloud

194
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:51,525
account using the Free Forever Plan,
because it comes with a fully managed

195
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:54,885
Prometheus instance in our Do We Know.

196
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:59,505
So we also installed additional
libraries such as Pro Low Key Transport

197
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,695
and Prometheus, Arduino to help us
send the sensor values to Prometheus.

198
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,540
So the next step was to store the
details of our Prometheus instance

199
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,160
in a configuration file so that
the code that we wrote in Arduino

200
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,510
could connect to Prometheus.

201
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:23,775
Here's the code snippet with some
details submitted for security reasons.

202
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:29,655
So essentially we needed to provide the
Prometheus instance, URL, the username

203
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:34,930
and the API token, as well as our wifi
details so our dino can send the data.

204
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:41,025
So for Arduino to send the data
securely to our Prometheus instance

205
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:45,285
in your phone cloud, we also needed
to provide a certificates file.

206
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:49,645
So this file was copied from the
Prometheus Arduino GitHub project.

207
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:57,315
The Prometheus Arduino GitHub project
also has a code example of how to send

208
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:59,805
the metrics from Arduino to Prometheus.

209
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,945
So instead of reinventing the wheel
and starting from scratch, we simply

210
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,925
copied the code example and updated
it slightly to work with our code.

211
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,480
My daughter asked me if this was
cheating because we copied the

212
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,690
code, so I had to explain that
this is normal when programming.

213
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,430
Um, but anyway, for the full project,
you can check out the plant monitoring

214
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,710
GitHub repo for all the details.

215
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,955
Now again, after uploading the updated
program to our development board, we

216
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:33,810
saw the following logs on our serial
monitor, which is a very good sign.

217
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:40,215
So the final piece of the project
was to visualize all of our

218
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:42,495
Prometheus data to Grafana Cloud.

219
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:47,025
While Prometheus was our
gardener, I explained that

220
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:49,725
Grafana is our core visualizer.

221
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:54,855
It takes a sensor values from Prometheus,
enters them into beautiful graphs,

222
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,705
making those values easier to understand.

223
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:06,584
So within our Grafana instance, we started
by creating a new dashboard in Grafana.

224
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:12,015
A dashboard is simply a collection of
one or more panels, and each panel can

225
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:18,824
display a specific visualization, such
as a bar graph, a table, or a gauge panel

226
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,854
with the data pulled from a data source.

227
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:27,704
In our case, the data source
is our Prometheus instance.

228
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:32,505
And the query is basically the query
that you already saw a while ago.

229
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:39,495
There are a lot of visualization
types in Grafana, so we had plenty of

230
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:43,425
choices to choose from and build the
dashboard the way how we wanted it.

231
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:49,515
Finally, we ended up with something
like this, so our dashboard was a

232
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:54,135
collection of multiple panels all
using Prometheus as our data source.

233
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,590
The first panel uses a text visualization,
which uses simple HTML code to

234
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,720
add the image of our house plant.

235
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,120
The next panel uses the stat
visualization, which is useful for

236
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,530
showing a single value and it's best
for showing information quickly,

237
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,630
such as the health of our plant.

238
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,100
The next panel uses the
gauge visualization.

239
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,010
So a gauge visualization is ideal for
showing where a value falls within a

240
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,170
range, and it's helpful for monitoring
metrics that have very clear thresholds.

241
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,110
In our case, I have a threshold that if
it's over 500, the soil is dry, and if

242
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,945
it's under, that means the soil is wet.

243
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,250
And finally, we also use the
time series visualization.

244
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,139
The time series visualization in Grafana
is the default and primary way to display

245
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:51,210
data points that change over time.

246
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,240
On the other hand, here's what our
dashboard looks like if the soil

247
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,670
moisture values are above 500.

248
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,070
So if you notice the color of our
stats and gauge visualizations

249
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,410
also changed from green to red.

250
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,610
So we were able to achieve this in
your fauna using value mappings.

251
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,270
So value mappings in Grafana are used
to convert raw data values into more

252
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,280
meaningful or user friendly texts,
icons, or colors on your dashboard.

253
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,555
So this way my daughter was also able
to understand the dashboard clearly.

254
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:34,425
Now having a dashboard to look at
is excellent, but we thought that

255
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:38,325
getting an alert when our plan
was thirsty would be even better.

256
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:42,915
So the final piece of our project
was to configure Grafana alerting.

257
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:49,065
To set this up, we created a new alert
rule with the alert condition that when

258
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:54,135
the query is above 500, to ensure that
we would only be alerted if the soil

259
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,140
moisture value was above this value.

260
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:01,815
And then the Prometheus query is still
the same query that we have been using.

261
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:08,505
We created a new contact point to
define where our alert should be sent.

262
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:13,575
When an alert rule is triggered,
a contact point is basically who

263
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:17,295
should receive a notification
when an alert rule is triggered.

264
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:22,815
For this example, we chose Telegram, so
every time the sensor value goes above

265
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:25,605
500, I would get notified on Telegram.

266
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,070
And then finally, everyone's been
talking a lot about AI these days, so

267
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,960
I might as well jump on that wagon.

268
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,905
Um, to enhance the look of our dashboard.

269
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:41,625
So you can see here that the
dashboard is much more professional.

270
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,005
It looks much more better.

271
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:47,715
Um, we also played around with
Grafana assistant, so Grafana

272
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:51,435
assistant is an AI powered agent, LLM.

273
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,280
That's, uh, integrated
and built into GR Cloud.

274
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,710
So here I simply ask if visual
enhancements can be made, and you

275
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,040
can see that the dashboard looks
so much better than the first

276
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,720
dashboard that you saw a while ago.

277
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,430
So, um, that's it for my talk.

278
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,300
Um, but to close this session,
here are some takeaways from doing

279
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,530
this project with my daughter.

280
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:20,385
Learning about monitoring
and observability is fun.

281
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,375
So by using gardening analogies,
I was able to explain these key

282
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,715
concepts to her in a playful way.

283
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:31,545
So I also encourage you to explain
technical stuff to one another more

284
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:36,555
often, whether that's at work or at
home in a fun, non condescending way.

285
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:41,730
Getting started with iot and
GANA is great for STEM learning.

286
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,770
After this project, we're thinking of
adding an automated watering system and

287
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,170
also maybe start other IO OT projects.

288
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,250
So this way I can also support
her interest to STEM subjects.

289
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,040
And finally, our plants are.

290
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,450
So if you want to know more about the
iot project and you want to learn about

291
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,760
Grafana as well as all the details that
you saw as part of this talk, then please

292
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,500
scan the, your code here that you can see,
um, on my screen to get all the relevant

293
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,720
information if you have any questions.

294
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,550
You can connect with me via LinkedIn, so
please scan your code that you see here.

295
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,900
Uh, but if you have specific
questions about Grafana, then

296
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,840
ask us@community.grafana.com.

297
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,710
I hope you enjoyed today's session,
and thank you so much for watching.

298
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:31,720
I.
