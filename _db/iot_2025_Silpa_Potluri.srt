1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,550
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,130
Welcome to Con 42 IOT Conference.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,800
My name is Ilpa plo.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,790
I have over 20 years of experience
in software development and

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,550
more than 10 years, 10 years of
experience in payments industry.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,970
Today I would like to talk about how
microservices architecture is transforming

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,560
payment systems for iot devices.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,669
Okay.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,770
This topic sits at the intersection
of payments, distributor systems

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,690
and connected devices, and it's
becoming increasingly relevant as more

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,910
devices begin to act on our behalf.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,920
To understand why this matters,
let's first let look at what's

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,780
changing in the payments landscape.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,030
We are in the middle of
an iot payment revolution.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,330
Payments are no longer
initiated, only by people.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,520
Devices themselves are making
decisions and triggering transactions,

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,800
sometimes thousands of times a day.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,310
Think about smart meters reporting
energy usage, vehicles paying

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,130
tolls, automatically appliances,
recording supplies, traditional

20
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:18,655
payment systems, assumed human
interaction, infrequent transactions,

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,550
and relatively large amounts.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,080
I iot completely breaks those assumptions.

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,780
So what happens when we try to support
this new world using old architectures?

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,310
Most legacy payment platforms
are monolithic, and that becomes

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,810
a serious problems with iot.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,030
First, scalability.

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,990
Vertical scaling simply doesn't
work when thousands of devices

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,110
suddenly come on our network.

29
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:53,925
Second deployment, speed waiting weeks to
deploy a security fix is unacceptable when

30
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,815
devices are already deployed in the field.

31
00:01:56,505 --> 00:02:01,395
And third, technology locking older
systems struggle to adopt modern

32
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:04,395
cryptography, machine learning,
or blockchain based integrations.

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,715
And unfortunately, these
aren't just performance issues.

34
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,695
They introduce real operational risk.

35
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:20,715
In monolithic systems, a failure
in one area can quickly cascade

36
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,125
across the entire platform.

37
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:27,345
For iot use cases like connected
vehicles or CD infrastructure, that

38
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,325
kind of outage is simply not tolerable.

39
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,105
Databases are another major bottleneck.

40
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:37,665
They were never designed to handle
real-time telemetry, high volume

41
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:42,345
micro transactions, fraud signals,
settlement records all at the same time.

42
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,460
So Monolithics are in the answer.

43
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:48,269
What is

44
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,340
This is where microservices architecture
come in instead of one large system.

45
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,780
We break the platform into smaller
independent services, each focused

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,100
on a single business capability,
authentication, authorization,

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,480
fraud detection, settlement.

48
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,315
Each becomes its own service
with its own lifecycle.

49
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:19,005
Let's look at why this architectural
shift works as so well for IO OT payments,

50
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:23,984
there are four core principles that
make microservices a strong fit here.

51
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,685
First, single responsibility.

52
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:29,894
Each service does one
thing and does it well.

53
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,355
Second, independent deployment.

54
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:36,045
We can update one service without
risking the rest of the system.

55
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,565
Third, technology flexibility.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,730
Each service uses the
best tool for its job.

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,860
And finally, fault isolation.

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,150
A failure in analytics shouldn't
stop payments from going through.

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,300
Now let's walk through how
this looks in practice.

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,130
Starting with device authentication,

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,480
IOT devices must authenticate on their
own often with limited processing

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,250
power, unreliable connectivity.

63
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,900
This requires.

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,530
Cryptographic credentials
embedded during manufacturing.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,410
Secure elements for tamper resistance.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,490
Full cycle management, including
ownership changes and decommissioning

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,530
microservices allow us to manage the
road, manage, and rotate credentials

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,960
without physically asking the device.

69
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,070
Once the device is authenticated, the
next step is dev, deciding whether

70
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,390
a transition should be allowed.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,850
Transaction auth authorization must happen
extremely fast, often in milliseconds.

72
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,300
We verify balances,
subscriptions and usage limits.

73
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,400
We access risk in real time.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,490
We validate geographic location to detect
impossible scenarios, and we enforce item

75
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,800
potency to prevent duplicate charges.

76
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,170
All of this happens automatically at
scale and without human involvement.

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,150
But there is another challenge
unique to iot transaction size.

78
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,470
Many iot transactions are tiny
fractions of ascent processing.

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,430
Each one individually isn't part
practical, so we aggregate them.

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,860
For example, a smart meter may generate
thousands of usage records per day.

81
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,540
These are accumulated.

82
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,140
Aggregated based on threshold
or schedules, and then

83
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,610
processed as a single payment.

84
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,230
At the same time, detailed logs
are preserved for transparency.

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,230
After authorization and
aggregation, we move into the

86
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,940
most regulated part of the system.

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,800
Settlement and fraud detection.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,020
Settlement is where money actually
moves and it requires strong

89
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,310
consistency and compliance.

90
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,130
Microservices support multi-state
settlement flows, continuous

91
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,950
reconciliation and integration
with banking networks.

92
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,350
Running alongside settlement is fraud
detection, powered by machine learning.

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,640
We analyze device behavior,
detect coordinated attacks, and

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,780
apply risk-based controls without
slowing normal transactions.

95
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,635
To make all of this efficient, we rely
heavily on a synchronous communication.

96
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,234
In an event, written architecture
services communicate through

97
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:34,065
events instead of direct calls.

98
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:39,405
When a device authenticates an
event is published, fraud detection

99
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:43,724
consumes it, analytics streams,
it, notifications react to it.

100
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,435
Platforms like Kafka allow us to scale
this to millions of events per day.

101
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:49,815
Perfect for iot.

102
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,790
Of course, all these devices
still need a secure endpoint

103
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,050
entry point into the system.

104
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,170
Ivo devices speak many protocols.

105
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,430
MQTT co-op HGDP and automotive protocols.

106
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:16,875
API Gateway translates these protocols
enforces security, applies rate, limits,

107
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,335
routes, requests to the right services.

108
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:24,045
This protects backend systems from
spikes, malformed requests and attacks.

109
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:30,525
Let's, let's see how all of this
comes together in a real world.

110
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,120
In a smart city scenario, thousands
of connected parking meters,

111
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,450
vehicles and charging stations
generate payments automatically.

112
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,900
Revenue must be distributed
across multiple agency, each

113
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,890
with different rules and.

114
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,400
Microservices allow each concern
to be handled independently while

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,960
still coordinating seamlessly,
while still coordinating seamlessly.

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,520
Running a system like this requires
strong operational discipline.

117
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:12,434
We

118
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,765
rely on distributed tracing to
follow requests across services.

119
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,955
Metrics and monitoring helps us
spot trends and anonymous anomalies.

120
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:27,465
Intelligent alerting tells
us when human intervention is

121
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:32,865
required without observability,
micro visas don't scale with it.

122
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:33,615
They thrive.

123
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:38,205
And none of this works without
strong security foundations.

124
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,775
We use multiple layers of security.

125
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,430
Secrets management, service
authentication, data tokenization,

126
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,820
network segmentation, and defense.

127
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,980
In depth, this approach meets strict
financial regulations while supporting

128
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,140
the scale and diversity of iot.

129
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
So where does this leave us?

130
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:16,050
Microservices provide a
foundation that's scalable.

131
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,969
Resilient unactive.

132
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,670
They allow payment platforms to grow with
the explosion of connected devices without

133
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,709
sacrificing reliability or security.

134
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,910
As billions more devices come
online, architectures like,

135
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,380
like this will be essential.

136
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,560
So as a summary, as we have seen today,
iot is redefining how payments happen and

137
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,730
microservices provide the foundation to
support that shift securely and at scale.

138
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,620
This approach allows payments
platform to grow, adapt, and

139
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,430
continue innovating at the connected
as the connected worlds expand.

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,670
This is it from me today.

141
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,565
Thank you for listening.
