Yes,,Liran Haimovitch,CTO,Rookout,,,,Why you’re getting understandability wrong,"Understandability is the most important concept in software, that most companies today aren’t tracking. Systems should be built and presented in ways that make it easy for engineers to comprehend them; the more understandable a system is, the easier it will be for engineers to change it in a predictable and safe manner. But with the rise of complex systems, it has become all too common that many times we no longer understand our own code once we deploy it.

As a result of increasing system complexity, developers are spending too much time firefighting and fixing bugs. In recent surveys, most devs say they spend at least a day per week troubleshooting issues with their code (sometimes, it can be a couple of days up to a full week trying to fix an elusive bug). This is hurting developer productivity and business results. It also creates a tough choice between flying slow or flying blind; as developers, we are too often making decisions without data in order to maintain velocity.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/liran-haimovitch-652bba95/,@liran_last,,,,java_liran.png,https://youtu.be/htiICUhTmH8,"understandability,wrong",tt_liran.png
No,testing,Brian Vermeer,Developer Advocate,Snyk,,,,Live hacking: Breaking into your Java web app,"In this session, we will demonstrate how common vulnerabilities in the Java eco-system are exploited on a daily base by live hacking real-world application libraries. All the examples used are commonly known exploits, some more famous than others, such as Apache Struts and Spring break remote code execution vulnerabilities.
 
By exploiting them and showing you how you can be attacked, before showing you how to protect yourself, you will have a better understanding of why and how security focus and DevSecOps is essential for every developer.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianvermeer/,@BrianVerm,,,,java_brian.png,https://youtu.be/xriZuPVyTZg,"live hacking,breaking java app",tt_brian.png

Code coverage can give you the answer, however can we trust our unit tests? Trust me or not, but I used to work for the investment banking industry in a big project where a lot of unit tests had no assertions (!). And yes… the coverage was very high.

Mutation testing is a method to check the quality of your unit tests and show more reasonable code coverage reports. In this session I will describe the idea of mutation testing and show a live example with the use of PIT Mutation Testing framework.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafal-leszko/,@RafalLeszko,,,,java_rafal.png,https://youtu.be/a9R9FRnkLu4,"mutation testing,pit",tt_rafal.png

No,deep dive,Dmitry Vinnik,Developer Advocate,Facebook,,,,Back to the CompletableFuture: Concurrency in Action,"Callback hell is a known way to give any JavaScript developer nightmares. However, Java developers are not much better off since anything concurrency and multithreading related gives us cold sweats.
 
With Threads and Runnables being the very first (and often last) things we used in Java, these classes gave many of us impression of and appreciation for complexities of concurrency. As a result, many developers abandoned the idea of ever touching thread management in Java and focused on a single-threaded development.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitry-vinnik/,@DmitryVinnik,,,,java_dmitry.png,https://youtu.be/it0Zo5QhlQk,concurrency,tt_dmitry.png

No,deep dive,Jonathan Meek,Software Developer,The Home Depot,,,,Making the Jump to JUnit 5: A walkthrough of migrating code from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5,"When it comes to our software, we talk very adamantly about upgrading the packages that support it and debate heavily on the cadence of those upgrades (e.g. monthly vs as we code). We treat the JVM versioning the same way: debate heavily on the cadence but generally agree that it should be upgraded throughout the lifecycle of the application. So why do we treat our testing frameworks any different? Aren’t they as critical as our application libraries and our JVM versions?
 
Of course! Some could argue even more so than the application libraries and the JVM versions. In the application of Test-Driven-Development (TDD), the first toolset that one touches is the testing framework and it would make sense to upgrade it often, given this is where TDD developers start.

No,deep dive,Naresha K,Independent Consultant,,,,,Effective Java with Groovy & Kotlin - How Languages Influence Adoption of Good Practices,"If you are curious to find out how the selection of language (Groovy & Kotlin in this case) not only improves developer productivity but also influences developers to adopt good practices, this talk is the right place to be in.
​
Effective Java' presents the most effective ways of using language. However, the adoption of these practices among Java developers is less than satisfactory. Over the years, Java has evolved as a platform, and it hosts several languages. Since Groovy and Kotlin run on JVM, most of the suggestions from Effective Java are equally relevant for Groovy and Kotlin developers. Moreover, these languages simplify the implementation by providing out of the box constructs for many of the recommended practices which can boost developer productivity.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nareshak/,@naresha_k,,,Conf42 Enterprise Software 2021 - Naresha K - Effetive java with groovy and kotlin.pdf,java_naresha.png,https://youtu.be/enIPf6_MFn4,"groovy,kotlin,good practices",tt_naresha.png

No,deep dive,Rob Hedgpeth,"Director, Developer Relations",MariaDB,,,,Getting Reactive with Relational Databases and R2DBC,"Not too long ago, a reactive variant of the JDBC API was released, known as Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC). While R2DBC started as an experiment to enable integration of SQL databases into systems that use reactive programming models, it now specifies a robust specification that can be implemented to manage data in a fully-reactive and completely non-blocking fashion.
 
In this session, we’ll briefly go over the fundamentals that make R2DBC so powerful. Then we'll take a pragmatic look at the recently released R2DBC driver from MariaDB to shed some light on how you can take advantage of crucial concepts, like event-driven behavior and back pressure, that enable fully-reactive, non-blocking interactions with relational databases.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/robhedgpeth/,@probablyrealrob,,,,java_rob.png,https://youtu.be/MF7UItjxDWA,"relational databases,r2dbc",tt_rob.png
No,deep dive,Yehonathan Sharvit,Clojure Wizard,Cycognito,,,,Data-Oriented programming,"Data-Oriented programming is a paradigm that aims at reducing the complexity of software systems and making the development experience more productive. Data-Oriented programming draws a clear separation between code and data and treats data as a value that is manipulated by general-purpose functions. In this talk, we illustrate the principles of Data-Oriented programming in the context of a Java production system.
