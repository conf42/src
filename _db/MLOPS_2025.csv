This presentation introduces a revolutionary AI-powered ""single pane of glass"" platform that transforms community living through intelligent integration and personalized engagement. Our comprehensive solution consolidates critical residential services into one unified dashboard, addressing the fragmentation that costs residents considerable time in service coordination. The platform leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations across multiple domains: educational facilities (schools and daycare with real-time review aggregation from multiple sources), trusted service providers (plumbing, handyman, lawn maintenance, and pest control with high resident satisfaction ratings), financial services (home insurance and mortgage references with potential cost savings), and healthcare networks (pediatric and general health provider referrals with faster appointment scheduling). Advanced AI-driven features include automated community management reducing administrative overhead, intelligent content personalization increasing resident engagement, and instant response systems achieving rapid query resolution. The platform facilitates seamless community center and sports court reservations (reducing booking conflicts), rental opportunity matching with high success rates, automated playdate coordination for families, and youth volunteer program management. Real-time housing market analytics provide residents with property value insights, showing improved portfolio appreciation awareness. Implementation across pilot communities demonstrated strong resident adoption rates, significant reduction in community management costs, and substantial increases in neighborhood satisfaction scores. This presentation will showcase deployment strategies, ROI metrics, and scalable frameworks for implementing AI-driven community engagement solutions that redefine modern residential living standards.",,,,,,Sheela Kakanur Shivayogi_mlops.png,https://youtu.be/JglCs7AJmg4,"mlops,mission,critical",

No,cloud,Terance Joseph Paulraj,Senior Data and BI Architect,SQA CONCEPTS,,,,AI-Driven Enterprise Intelligence: Enabling Real Time Decision Making in MLOps,"Enterprises today are moving beyond retrospective business intelligence toward systems that can process data continuously and support decision making in real time. In this session, we will explore how artificial intelligence and MLOps practices come together to create enterprise intelligence platforms that integrate real time analytics, predictive modeling, and automated decision workflows.

The focus will be on how distributed data processing, machine learning models, reinforcement learning, and natural language interfaces can be systematically combined to enhance enterprise responsiveness. Instead of isolated AI implementations, organizations can establish unified frameworks where models, pipelines, and monitoring are embedded into daily operations. This shift enables proactive responses to business events and supports more adaptive, resilient processes across domains such as financial services, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing.

Another important theme is responsible AI. We will discuss the role of governance, bias detection, explainability methods, and compliance practices in ensuring that AI driven decision systems remain transparent and trustworthy. Ethical considerations are increasingly central to adoption, and we will examine approaches for balancing performance with fairness and accountability.

Attendees will leave with a practical blueprint for building enterprise intelligence systems within their MLOps environments. This includes architectural considerations for cloud native infrastructure, strategies for machine learning integration, and methods for automating routine decisions while retaining human oversight where necessary. The session highlights how AI can move from fragmented pilots to cohesive, scalable platforms that improve agility, efficiency, and stakeholder confidence.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/terancejp/,,,,,Terance Joseph Paulraj_mlops.png,https://youtu.be/GJz2aMtP14s,"code,configuration,building",
