yes,,Kenneth DuMez,Developer Relations Engineer,Teleport,,,,Why you should never use static shared secrets in GitHub Actions,"This talk will focus on the existing vulnerabilities and downsides of using shared encrypted secrets to access key pieces of infrastructure programmatically using GitHub Actions and how you can greatly improve the security of your GitHub workflows. As GitHub Actions has matured as a product and more and more companies rely on it for their CI/CD workflows, an exposed secret in the repository can be the difference between a team being able to efficiently test/deploy code, and an infrastructure penetration nightmare. Allow your devops engineering team to sleep easier at night by replacing GitHub secret management with Teleport machineID, allowing your GitHub Actions workflow to manage infrastructure resources like Kubernetes clusters, databases and more, all without having to rely on shared secrets stored in your repository.
The talk will include an overview of existing vulnerabilities, how Teleport MachineID rethinks automated infrastructure access, as well as a demo showing how you can control your Kubernetes clusters using GHA workflows without secrets while keeping a full audit trail and control of your workflow. Leave shared secrets behind in 2022 and enter the new year with Teleport MachineID, giving you, your engineers, and customers peace of mind.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-dumez-086b84220/,,,,,devops_kenneth_dumez.png,,"static,shared,secrets,github,actions",30

Common anti patterns: - one infra team or person
- everyone else is almost afraid infrastructure changes
- silos
- burnout
Why does this happen?
- Terraform (and any other IaC) is yet ANOTHER tool to learn
- Different kids of infrastructure might be new to people
- Lack of visibility into infra/cloud

no,tools,Gianluca Mardente,Principal Engineer,Cisco Systems,,,,Manage Kubernetes addons for multiple cluster using runtime state,"Kubernetes itself is not a complete solution. To build a production cluster, various additional addons like CNI or CoreDNS are needed. There are some solutions already. But if:
1. N Kubernetes clusters need to be managed;
2. the configuration has to change automatically when clusters runtime state changes;
we feel a new declarative solution is needed.
Given above requirements, Sveltos wants to figure out the best way to install, manage and deliver cluster addons. The idea is simple:
1. have one management cluster from where all managed clusters can be reached;
1. from the management cluster, selects one or more clusters with a Kubernetes label selector;
2. lists which Kubernetes addons need to be deployed on such clusters.
Then have a controller that automatically detects new clusters and react to configuration changes and bring cluster states to match the desired states
.
![Sveltos ClusterProfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager/main/doc/sveltos.png)
This solution needs to be able to fetch information from the management cluster. For instance, when deploying calico, pod cidrs might have to be provided. Which pod cidrs has to be used in which cluster, is usually an information present in the management cluster (in a management cluster with ClusterAPI, such information is present in the corresponding Cluster instance, in the Spec section). ![Fetch information from management cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/.github/main/docs/sveltos_calico.png)
So far, such solution still requires user to manage cluster labels. Ideally, which labels need to be attached to a cluster should be automatically detected by looking at cluster runtime state. This is especially true for long lived clusters.
Let's considered a very simple scenario. A set of addons (with a specific versions) are deployed in any production cluster running kubernetes version v1.24.x. When any of those clusters is upgraded to a Kubernetes version v1.25.x, a new set of addons (maybe just different versions) needs to be deployed. Instead of requiring user to change cluster labels when clusters are upgraded (which is error prone very easy to forget), we introduced a new concept: Sveltos Classifier.
Using Classifier users can classify clusters based on:
1. Kubernetes version
2. Kubernetes resources
and can define set of labels a matching cluster should have.
Using a combination of ClusterProfile and Classifier, we can have Sveltos: 1. automatically detects cluster runtime state and updates cluster labels;
- deploys new set of addons as soon as cluster is upgraded and its runtime state changes (because its labels have been updated by Sveltos as consequence of #1).
![Sveltos Classifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/demos/main/classifier/classifier.gif)
When deploying N addons in M clusters, an emphasis need to be on visibility. When making a change it must be clear what effects are going to be (which clusters are going to be impacted and how).
So sveltos can be set in DryRun mode. While in DryRun mode, we can make any change and nothing will be propagated to managed cluster. Rather when done, we can use sveltos to see what would happen because of our changes and where (which clusters). Sveltos will create a summary table listing:
- which helm charts will be deployed/deleted;
- which helm charts will be upgraded (from which version to which version);
- which kubernetes resources will be updated.
After reviewing if fine with the change, Sveltos can be switched back to continuous mode and only then it will propagated changes to managed cluster.
Sveltos also supports taking snapshots and rollback of the configuration.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianlucamardente/,@projectsveltos,,,,devops_gianluca_mardente.png,,"kubernetes,addons,multiple,cluster,runtime,state",

It is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. The holy grail for platform engineering today is to achieve the most effective “Internal Developer Platform” (IDP) that enables the rest of the developers in the company to be as effective as possible. Can this job be accomplished with engineering skills alone?
Platform intersects with product in two ways: first, the platform must be optimized for supporting the development of the company-specific product. Second, the platform has to be built with a product mindset and practices for it to be adopted by its users - the developers. In this session, we will discuss how to build an engineering platform that your engineers will actually want to use. We will go over standard product practices to use when creating the developer platform, and also the importance of making sure your IDP actually helps developers build the company’s products faster and better. We will define the role of the platform product manager (PPM), and the importance he plays in ensuring our platform is not a glorified Rube Goldberg machine.

Imagine, for instance, that the building/testing/deployment service of your CI/CD platform is experiencing performance issues (or worse) at the same exact time when you are deploying a brand new feature into live code. How do we prevent a disaster? And what if we are in rush for a hot-fix?
The first step is to establish observability, which focuses on enabling full-stack visibility of your environment. This enables end-to-end insights, which provide transparency of all your internal components and help you understand how these interact with each other, as well as how they affect the overall systems. Unlike traditional monitoring approaches, the aim is to understand why something is broken, instead of merely focusing on what is broken. Ideally, we want to shift the paradigm from reactive to predictive.
Once observability has been enabled across our end-to-end environment, we will employ AI/ML techniques in order to pre-emptively alert, as well as prevent any form of system degradation. We combine these strategies mentioned so far with SRE methodologies (e.g. SLO, error budget) when measuring our system's overall health. This type of approach provides an additional layer of reliability to DevOps pipelines.
For this session, we have prepared and analyzed several use cases, followed main principles, summarized best practices and built a live demo through a combination of Observability and continuous deployment tools.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-dodic/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsbaraglia/,,,devops_michele_dodic_francesco_sbaraglia.png,,"ai-driven,devops,ci/cd,pipelines",

Let microservices be everywhere with confidence!
60+% of organizations cite microservices as a leading driver for API growth in the next 2 years. Teams continue to break down monolithic systems, seeking to capitalize on the advantages of decoupled capabilities - reduced costs, reduced TTM, faster releases, decentralized evolvability. Such benefits don't linearly scale! Managing the API sprawl is out weighting the benefits for many!
Even with the solid extensibility design, governance workflows and high levels of automation, all of which leveraging OpenAPI and other leading specifications, it can be difficult to know what constitutes a breaking change to an API.
What's the impact?
Teams providing APIs lose sight of who their consumers are. Consumers lose track of what surface area of APIs they are using. In fact, any observable change in the behavior of an API will be deemed breaking by certain consumers (Hyrum’s Law).
Can it be addressed?
Contact testing with Pact, empowers providers and consumers to determine the impact of any change from their IDE. It addresses the coordination & communication challenges associated with delivering distributed systems. Thus calming the chaos caused by the microservices sprawl.
Bi-directional contract testing capabilities in Pactflow, hits the sweet spot with design-first flows. Using provider-driven contract testing, developers can quickly scale by leveraging existing OpenAPI documentation investments to create tests reusing the same OpenAPI artifacts. One contract and lots of Pacts with your consumers!

And this is fundamentally changing the capabilities of the network and the role it plays. As applications merge with infrastructure, there’s a need for network engineers to expand their software skills. For example, they need to know how to innovate with programmable infrastructure, which means understanding how people use the network and how the network in turn supports the business. Typically, infrastructure engineers are responsible for automation and software-defined infrastructure programmability, along with multi-cloud and AI/ML. Software developers are focused on the Internet of Things, edge computing, analytics, DevOps and cloud. But the network of the future will combine both.
