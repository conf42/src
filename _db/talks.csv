,keynote,Dewan Ahmed,1,1,Harness,Dewan Ahmed.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/diahmed/,,,,Keynote: Secure by Default: Building Confidence in AI-Driven Delivery,"The fastest way to break trust in DevSecOps is to automate insecurity at scale. As AI takes a central role in our pipelines, it is time to rethink what ""secure by default"" really means.

In this keynote, Dewan Ahmed will challenge the audience to look beyond vulnerability scanners and compliance gates. He will share a vision for intelligent security by design, where native intelligence within the delivery platform detects not only vulnerable code but risky delivery behavior such as misconfigured environments, suspicious artifact provenance, and drift between source and runtime.

You will walk away with a framework for balancing automation with human oversight and examples from Harness’ work on building verifiable, auditable, AI-native delivery systems. In the new world of DevSecOps, safety is not a step; it is an outcome we continuously learn to improve.",,"Dewan Ahmed is a Principal Developer Advocate at Harness and a Governing Board General Member Representative at the Continuous Delivery Foundation.

,keynote,Ben Hopp,1,1,Imply,Ben Hopp.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhopp/,,,,Keynote: Decoupling Observability for Incident Response at Scale,"On-call incidents don’t fail because teams lack dashboards. They fail because observability systems slow down under real investigative load.

As telemetry volumes grow and retention windows expand, SRE teams are being asked to run deeper, broader investigations—often under time pressure—on platforms that were designed for steady-state monitoring, not bursty incident response. Tightly coupled observability stacks bind storage, compute, and query together, forcing teams to overprovision infrastructure, limit retention, or accept degraded performance during incidents.

In this talk, we’ll explore why decoupling observability architectures is becoming essential for SRE teams operating at scale. Using a real incident investigation workflow, we’ll break down how separating data storage, compute, and interaction layers allows teams to keep fast, reliable monitoring while elastically scaling investigations when incidents occur.

We’ll connect these patterns to lessons learned in other data-intensive systems, but stay grounded in the day-to-day realities of on-call life: faster root cause analysis, fewer tradeoffs during incidents, and observability systems that hold up when you need them most.",,"Ben Hopp is an Architect at Imply, where he helps organizations decouple their observability stack with Imply Lumi.

,keynote,AJ Mejorado,1,1,Chainguard,AJ Mejorado.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amejorado/,,,,Keynote: The Best CVE Is the One You Never Patch: Removing Vulnerability Toil for SREs,"For most SRE teams, CVE remediation has become a never-ending source of toil—rebuilds, backports, emergency releases, and late-night firefighting. This talk explores how Chainguard flips that model by removing vulnerability remediation from the SRE workload entirely.
We’ll look at how secure-by-default images, continuous rebuilds, and automated patch pipelines eliminate the need for teams to chase CVEs in production. Instead of reacting to vulnerabilities, SREs inherit artifacts that are already patched, minimal, and ready to run—freeing them to focus on reliability, performance, and scale.
This session is about shifting CVE response left, shrinking the attack surface, and giving SRE teams their time back—because patching shouldn’t be an on-call responsibility.",,"AJ Mejorado is a Solutions Engineer at Chainguard with a background in DevOps and CI/CD.

,keynote,Endre Sara,1,1,Causely ,Endre Sara.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/endresara/,,,,Keynote: The Missing Layer in AI-Driven Reliability ,"AI agents are entering incident response with powerful capabilities—detecting anomalies, summarizing logs, and suggesting fixes. Some even execute changes autonomously. The promise is compelling: fully autonomous resolution of production incidents in complex, constantly changing distributed systems. 

But before we hand control to agents, we must ask a fundamental question: What kind of understanding must exist before we let agents act? 

This talk argues that the real bottleneck is not model intelligence, but the absence of a continuously updated causal model of the system itself.

,keynote,Francois Martel,1,1,NeuBird AI,Francois Martel.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/martelcloud/,,,,Keynote: The AI SRE Landscape: From LLMs to Multi-Agent Ecosystems,"With more than 15 vendors now claiming AI powered SRE capabilities, engineering leaders are facing a deafening amount of noise. Teams are asking hard questions. Is Datadog Bits AI the same thing as an AI agent? AWS just launched a DevOps Agent. Do we still need a vendor? Our ServiceNow rep says their AI can handle it all. How do you cut through the hype?

This talk provides a practical framework for understanding the AI systems transforming Site Reliability Engineering, including foundation LLMs, RAG systems, chat based tools, agentic AI, and multi agent ecosystems. We map the current vendor landscape across five categories: Incident Coordinators, AI Investigators, Observability Native AI, Cloud Provider Agents, and Coding Agents. You will see what each category can actually do today and why context engineering, not model intelligence, is the real differentiator.

The session includes a live walkthrough of a multi agent workflow handling a production incident end to end. It starts with intelligent detection and root cause analysis, continues through automated remediation using a coding agent, and finishes with verified resolution. Humans stay in the loop only where it matters. The workflow persists for hours, coordinates across tools, and retains full context throughout.

You will leave with a clear mental model for evaluating AI SRE tools and a phased adoption roadmap. The key takeaways are straightforward. Know what type of AI you are buying. Invest in context architecture over model hype. Build a layered stack rather than a monolith.",,"Francois Martel is the Field CTO at Neubird.ai, where he works with SRE and platform teams to apply generative AI to real world reliability and operations challenges.
