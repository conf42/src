The aim of this work is to forecast department-wide sales for Walmart stores using machine learning models, specifically focusing on improving forecast accuracy. This study sought to evaluate an XGBoost ML model's ability to estimate supply chain demand. The researchers used sales data from several departments at 45 Walmart outlets in the United States. Making the data ready for ML by dealing with missing values and converting the categorical features. Data was then splitted into training and testing sets for performance evaluation. The XGBoost model produced promising results .When comparing the results of XGBoost with other models, such as decision tree regression or linear regression, XGBoost was found to provide better results by a noticeable margin in all three metrics (MAE, MSE, and RMSE). Thus, it can be concluded that XGBoost is an effective approach for enhancing the precision of demand prediction in a supply chain.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/contactjubinthomas/,,,,,Jubin Thomas_ml.png,,"forecasting,supply,chain",

No,security,Vishnuvardhana Reddy Veeraballi,Cloud Advisor,,,,,Quantum Computing Encryption: Trends in Cybersecurity & the Race for Quantum-Safe Solutions,"The rise of quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional encryption methods, potentially rendering widely used systems such as RSA and ECC vulnerable to quantum attacks. With quantum computers capable of solving problems exponentially faster than classical systems, the need for quantum-resistant encryption is urgent.

This talk explores emerging trends in cybersecurity as it relates to quantum-safe encryption, focusing on **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**.

## Current Vulnerabilities

Many current encryption systems rely on mathematical problems such as factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithms. Quantum algorithms like **Shor’s Algorithm** can solve these problems efficiently, undermining the security of RSA, ECC, and other conventional cryptosystems.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

PQC offers promising alternatives that are designed to resist quantum attacks. Some notable approaches include:

- **Lattice-based cryptography**
- **Hash-based signatures**
- **Code-based cryptography**

While these algorithms show strong potential, they also come with challenges such as:

- Performance limitations  
- Large key and signature sizes  
- Complexity in integrating with existing infrastructure

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD represents a groundbreaking method for secure communication by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics. It allows for:

- Detection of any eavesdropping attempts  
- Theoretical guarantees of communication security

A prime example of QKD in action is **China’s 2,000 km Beijing-Shanghai quantum link**. However, QKD still faces hurdles:

- Limited range and transmission speed  
- High infrastructure and deployment costs

## Standardization and Future Strategies

Organizations like **NIST** are actively working on standardizing PQC algorithms, marking a critical step toward widespread adoption. However, this transition involves:

- Technical and logistical challenges  
- Ensuring compatibility with legacy systems

### Future-Proofing Approaches

To safeguard data in the quantum era, hybrid encryption methods are being considered. These combine classical and quantum-resistant algorithms to ensure:

- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Authentication**

## Conclusion

With continued research, international collaboration, and strategic planning, the shift toward quantum-safe encryption is both necessary and achievable. Ensuring secure digital infrastructure in the face of quantum advancements is essential for the future of cybersecurity.
