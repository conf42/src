<p>How do you reconcile the ideals of blamelessness with a demand for blame? When is accountability actually required? We&rsquo;ll navigate these challenges by explaining:</p>
<p><strong>How to empathize with blameful people</strong> - we&rsquo;ll look at how their goals align with yours, even if their methods are archaic<br />
<strong>How to skilfully respond to a demand for blame</strong> - blameful peoples&rsquo; goals can be achieved blamelessly - here&rsquo;s how to communicate that<br />
<strong>When is accountability necessary?</strong> - sometimes accountability is part of the best way forward - let&rsquo;s figure out when<br />
<strong>How to be blamelessly accountable</strong> - true accountability requires blamelessness - we&rsquo;ll show you why</p>

                You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native. We wanted to reconcile the idea of being totally blameless, but still holding personal accountability. And we're really excited to share what we found today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Christina: You can't underestimate the importance of being blameless. Emily: Show that there is business value in having a blameless culture. What starts to dissolve conflict is when you start to see commonalities between the parties.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Leaders might assume that punishment will deter others from making the same error. How can we skillfully address it so that we challenges their mind without triggering their defense mechanisms? Ask questions when both the leader and you are in a calm state of mind.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Trying to create empathy between the leader and the engineer that was involved. It's possible that the engineer doesn't fully understand the business impact. Are there other ways to rebuild trust with stakeholders besides retribution?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The best way to respond to an incident is to be direct and succinct. Focus on common ground and creating psychological safety. Having shared goals is extremely important. Follow up investigation could look like. systemic changes that can prevent incidents like this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When is it fair to hold someone accountable in the traditional sense where you are actually letting someone go? Have you accounted for all other contributing factors? This is a very distinct and separate process from incident resolution. This is performance management.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Twitter learned that accountability faces forward. Team that is accountable will take full ownership of improving reliability. There's no trade off between blameless culture and accountability. Leadership is critical in fostering a psychologically safe culture. It takes incredible empathy, stress tolerance and critical thinking to get blamelessness and accountability working together in harmony.
