            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Panelists talk about observability, the future of it, and what we can do with current tooling. What an amazing group of folks that we have here, from all walks of journey of observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How did you all get started on observability? For me, I got into observability because of charity. The idea is to make more people like me able to be more like Amy. This is all stuff we've been doing throughout, but we're getting better at it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A common thing people ask me is, hey, teach me to do that thing you do in incidents. It's really freaking hard to teach. People need something to start on. They need some way to start going down that journey instead of being dumped in a sea of, as charity put it, like, context less metrics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I had a question around where observability is headed. I think it's just going to keep growing more and more towards tracing. Hopefully we'll see a little less emphasis on metrics and logs over the next like five, five ish years.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The difference between observability 1.0 and 2.0 is Tools have many sources of truth. Where you've got metrics, stop. sending money and engineering cycles into the money hole. Reallocate that to logs. Make them as wide as you can.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can't run a business with metrics right on the business side of the house. A mistake a lot of people make when they start instrumenting their code is like, auto instrumentation is salvation. Post QA, where you want to be is you want that observability loop.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developers should get into the habit of debugging their own code by using the instrumentation that they add to their code. If you make a practice of looking at this, you'll start to know if there's something that you don't know there. The ultimate answer here is like playing piano or playing any music instrument.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Adriana: How is the AI movement helping or not helping people in their observability journey? She says a lot of people, like, pin AI as a salvation, and we got to chill. Adriana says at this point, we're really just using it to generate lines of code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The complexity of everything we build and operate has gotten out of control. We look for answers anywhere we think we might find them, whether it's a guru or a machine. When it comes to understanding complex systems, there are two kinds of tools. Be careful which end you're pointing this insanely complex tool at.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do you see the relationship between observability and platform engineering evolving? Teams that have, whether or not they call themselves platform engineering teams are really turning into force multipliers and like accelerators for the companies that they're at.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do you be a champion for observability and really empower your team to do it? The better your observability get, the better. The easier everything gets, the easier it is to start shortening your pipeline. The hardest part is that first service.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We would love to thank all of our attendees for coming out to our panel. Hopefully, you got to learn a little bit more about observability and how you can take this into your journey, your organization, and embark on observability 2.0.
