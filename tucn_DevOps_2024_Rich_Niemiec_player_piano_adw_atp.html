              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                This talk talks about autonomous database and how you can get Oracle to manage some of your databases in an expert manner. Things are coming very big in AI with Oracle, with the new vector database. For a DBA, it is time for workers to start to worry about AI.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Autonomous database spreads to online transaction processing. Also has autonomous data or active data guard that allows you if one there's an outage in a region. Free. Cloud oracle. com try it or cloud slash free and you create your first autonomous database.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Get started for free ATp oracle. com cloud slash free when I sign up. Your account automatically gets decommissioned. In the first 30 days you could try all these different things. You could do autonomous data warehouse autonomous transaction processing. Easy to use, free to try.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's not just ATP and ADW, but there's also autonomous JSON database. There's also Apex, which is a front end application. Create and run notebooks in Oracle if you're not familiar with notebooks. What I think people really need now is predictive and prescriptive analytics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Once I build an autonomous database, I could start to do machine learning. What is an algorithm? It's just math. Am I looking to classify data? Maybe I want to cluster big data into age groups, or maybe to look through customers to see any anomalies that are out there.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A machine learning notebook can be built in four minutes. It can try every algorithm for you, tell you the accuracy of that, and then it can say, create the notebook. What kind of machine learning algorithms are used in healthcare?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Oracle also has AI and machine learning built into things like manufacturing, financials and things like that. Also have IoT connections and chat bots as well, if you're interested. We're moving into this future world that really is enabling innovation now.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Robots and automation impact the jobs are ready delivery. Is autonomous database going to make me obsolete? How can your business leverage it? Which piece of it can it leverage?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Now they have a vector database as well. Oracle's eight a stack. They have a digital assistant. But this generative AI is a big one. You want to look to build your foundation model for your company.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Gartner: The world is changing fast. Those who use things of the world should not become too attached. Things may come to those who wait, but only things left by those who hustle.
