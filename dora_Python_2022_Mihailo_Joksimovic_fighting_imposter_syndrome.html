    <meta property="og:description" content="I've been witness of numerous people, myself included, becoming a victim to Imposter Syndrome.  Funny enough, due to keeping it "to ourselves", we almost never realize that others are feeling the exact same way. Hence we feel as ISOLATED imposters.  As someone who has spent years in therapy and has been exploring the causes, effects and ways to mitigate imposter syndrome, I see it as my job to share my findings and experiences with others. And that's exactly what this talk is all about!"/>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been witness of numerous people, myself included, becoming a victim to Imposter Syndrome.</p>
<p>Funny enough, due to keeping it &ldquo;to ourselves&rdquo;, we almost never realize that others are feeling the exact same way. Hence we feel as ISOLATED imposters.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent years in therapy and has been exploring the causes, effects and ways to mitigate imposter syndrome, I see it as my job to share my findings and experiences with others. And that&rsquo;s exactly what this talk is all about!</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Imposters syndrome creates feelings of anxiousness, of fear, of self doubt. The more successful you are, the more of these feelings you have. You can't conquer it, but you can learn some techniques and tactics for fighting it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Just by preparing this presentation, I has having one of the most massive, ever biggest attacks of imposter syndrome. All those feelings of self doubt and questioning yourself and pretty much being insecure about yourself. But obviously, the good thing is that you can learn to deal with it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Software engineers go through some same issues, some same problems, questions, fears, anxieties, frustrations, whatever. But we never share these findings with others, and by not sharing them, we feel kind of isolated. I hope to show you that you're not the only one.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of us, especially in software engineering or in any kind of art, could suffer from this imposters syndrome and from perfectionism. The more successful you are, the more intense these emotions and feelings of imposter are. Try to identify them. I encourage you to write about them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of the things and most of the manifestations of human beings are due to evolution. What's the use of feeling like a fraud? Most of it is actually a natural mechanism to make you move. But this should tell you that the aim should not be to feel good all the time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of the time, if you feel like an imposter in your career, that's most likely a signal that you're doing a good job. That means that you are about to move out of your comfort zone. But in the worst case, you should always seek a therapy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We all have imposter syndrome and we will all have it forever. The first tool in our toolbox is the easiest one, believe it or not, and it's acknowledgment. The technique that I personally think is most useful and yet most difficult to implement is discipline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next technique is occasionally reviewing your successes. The last one is doing something that you suck at honestly. You would be surprised how much you are achieving. And finally, obviously there is just no replacement for the ultimate king of fighting the imposters. That's therapy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Four books to consider if you are not feeling like doing something that you suck at or going for a therapy. Tim Ferriss, extreme ownership. There is just no replacement for thinking fast and slow. Four books, absolutely highly recommended by myself and many people around me.

              </li>
