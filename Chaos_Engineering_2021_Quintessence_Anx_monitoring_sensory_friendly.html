    <meta property="og:description" content="As infrastructure increases in complexity and monitoring increases in granularity, engineering teams can be notified about each and every hiccup in each and every server, container, or process. In this talk, I’ll be discussing how we can stay in tune with our systems without tuning out.  The ability to monitor infrastructure has been exploding with new tools on the market and new integrations, so the tools can speak to one another, leading to even more tools, and to a hypothetically very loud monitoring environment with various members of the engineering team finding themselves muting channels, individual alerts, or even alert sources so they can focus long enough to complete other tasks. There has to be a better way - a way to configure comprehensive alerts that send out notifications with the appropriate level of urgency to the appropriate persons at the appropriate time. And in fact there is: during this talk I’ll be walking through different alert patterns and discussing: what we need to know, who needs to know it, as well as how soon and how often do they need to know."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>As infrastructure increases in complexity and monitoring increases in granularity, engineering teams can be notified about each and every hiccup in each and every server, container, or process. In this talk, I’ll be discussing how we can stay in tune with our systems without tuning out.</p>
<p>The ability to monitor infrastructure has been exploding with new tools on the market and new integrations, so the tools can speak to one another, leading to even more tools, and to a hypothetically very loud monitoring environment with various members of the engineering team finding themselves muting channels, individual alerts, or even alert sources so they can focus long enough to complete other tasks. There has to be a better way - a way to configure comprehensive alerts that send out notifications with the appropriate level of urgency to the appropriate persons at the appropriate time. And in fact there is: during this talk I’ll be walking through different alert patterns and discussing: what we need to know, who needs to know it, as well as how soon and how often do they need to know.</p>

              <li>
                When you have too much noise, it buries high importance and severe alerts in a sea of low priority notifications. What we need to do with all of this is find a happy medium. Make sure you have any echo Alexa devices in listening range or use headphones.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The time cost that you lose when you redirect your focus is 25 minutes. George Mason University introduced noise into the environment and their error rate tripled. Even when you reduce the complexity of the task, you still encounter problems from high distraction mode.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need to set times to focus on work and then be able to mute those noncritical alerts. You don't want to just mute the notifications without communicating. Make sure you're communicating to coworkers too. Monitoring, et cetera, goes back to categorization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You also want to make sure that you have enough redundancy in order to prevent a vacuum. Are you regularly evaluating the reliability of your services? And this includes internal tools.
