              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Hi, welcome to our platform engineering from the trenches talk. We'll take you through our experiences building platforms over the last few years. We have a story to share and some lessons learned so you don't fall into the same traps as we did.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In enterprise, organization means that you're always in a changing environment. This is where the platform dream and what the reality is. What you ideally want if you're building a platform is frictionless delivery of business value. To really come up with an integrated vision, you have to transform something that is transforming while the shop is open.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most important thing for us is to be customer centric. Product thinking will help you design your platform in such a way that it focuses on two things. Always focus on capabilities rather than tools. Find your unique value proposition for your platform and that is unique to your context.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So of course, measuring your success is also very important. Start talking to people, for instance, to gather feedback. Measure things like customer engagement or employee satisfaction. Without these measures, you're not in the business of running a proper platform.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A unicorn topic is self service. These platforms where their value also is in how they can easily scale. How you can onboard more and more users without becoming a bottleneck yourself. Always be sure to remove waiting times if you go shopping in the supermarket.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do you build trust and help people agree that we are going to build a platform? Focus on influencing the right people and the right teams so that you can get some traction. Be mindful of the pace that you are making change.

              <li>
                One of the things we really like to do is building a community around our platform. This is for knowledge sharing purposes. Also standardize on the way you communicate. We are really in the business of helping teams focus on core instead of context.

              <li>
                We seek two kinds of metrics. The metrics from the system and the metric from the people. We need to work more towards defining standards. The main goal that we still have is accelerated delivery of business value.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Keep improving the collaboration with your customers, helps them to make those technical decisions together. Of course, we really need to measure when we are successful. Goal is to accelerate the delivery of business value. Dora metrics are an excellent way to do this.

                If you have any questions or want to discuss further, we're delighted to have the conversation with us with you. We'll be of available in the Discord channel of the conference and you can also always look us up on LinkedIn and just drop us a message and we'll discuss.
