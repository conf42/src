              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                How do you make a difference in the world? The answer is you leverage technology. We're going to look at some of the ways you can use not just AI, but how to also leverage things like machine learning. We'll also look at where exactly to use AI and machine learning for a given company.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're moving from predictive to prescriptive right now. Oracle has a database called an autonomous database. The company's focus isn't to be a retail innovator, it's to make you the innovator. You can download this talk, but you'll have to use it in the specific parts of your business that matter.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is a decision tree? A lot of different choices of data you already know about a business to make decisions quickly. It also does speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and it's built based on math that was built maybe 70 years ago. You can make a business impact if you'll make a decision to use AI.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using machine learning, you can find out what attributes make a customer a good customer or a bad customer. What about SQL analytics? Can you look at different views, whether it's regional managers or financial managers? Pretty much anything you could ever think you want to do, it's out there somewhere.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Oracle has a product called Apex, comes free with the database. They want generative AI to do this for them. Chat GPT is actually 3.5, came out last year. AI is going to be big because it's going to get us to general intelligence.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Oracle is using a product called Cohere to do the large language model, but they're also building and now have a vector database. They added something called retrieval augmented generation to give a better answer and it just becomes much more accurate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most AI is powered by machine learning. You could also use virtual assistant with robots. And you could also leverage database with virtual reality, mixed reality, augmented reality. The key for you is to see which pieces matter.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What does generative AI do? Makes it a little faster yet. What started all this gen AI? Well, something called transformers at Google Brain. But don't forget, things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
