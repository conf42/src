                Monolith to microservices accelerate your modernization with AWS app to container and Amazon Q. Richard Lees leads our application modernization go to market strategy in Emir. Also joined by my colleague Jorge Alvarez.

              <li>
                We'll talk about monoliths and microservices and the benefits and concerns of both. The first is around accelerating your modernization journey with AWS apt to container. The second eagerly anticipated part is refactoring using Gen AI with Amazon Q. And then finally at the end, we'll wrap up with some next steps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amir: Customers typically modernize their applications for three reasons. The first is speed and agility. The second is security and operational resilience. The third is cost and elasticity. Customers lean into four modernization pathways. Those are move to cloud native, move to managed, moved to managed data, and move to open source.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The monolith presents some inherent challenges that become more prevalent as you scale. Individual components cannot scale independently. Often adopting new technologies can be difficult in a more distributed architecture. So, from monolith to microservices, can solve a lot of the problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Today we'll be modernizing from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture in an effort to get more business agility, be more cost efficient, and create a more portable code base. We'll be diving into Amazon Q so Amazon's Genai tooling to see how we can use Genai to accelerate our application modernization efforts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AWS Appt container can be used to modernize your application and AWS. The impact is your operations. There are four steps to moving an application from on Prem to the cloud. Jorge Alvarez will take us through these steps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Up to container is a tool that helps you containerize an image. In this demo, we will see how up to container can help us in this journey. We will also see how the tool can analyze the application itself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Jorge: I have my deployment solution created. It has been containerized, it has been validated. And I have everything to start the deployment, literally to AWS. If you can keep going, following exactly the steps that the solution gives you, and repeat and repeat again and again.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Q is a new generative AI assistant that is designated to help you in your day to day journey. It can give you answers to your questions inside of your AWS console or even in your more preference ide. Today we are going to focus only on the Amazon queue, your AWS expert.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Amazon Q has transformed the application from Java eleven to Java 17. Now that application team can really go on that modernization journey and use Amazon Q to start refactoring code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If app to container is something that you think can benefit your business and your customers and Amazon Q is something you're looking to explore, then we have a couple of recommended next steps for you. Just keep going and keep trying these different solutions that help you to modernize.
