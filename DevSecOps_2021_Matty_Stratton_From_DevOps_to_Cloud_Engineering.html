    <meta property="og:description" content="We have been talking about devops for years. Along the way, we’ve added various syllables to the portmanteau “devops” to include all the practices and disciplines that are key to doing this effectively. What if DevOps, DevSecOps, and all the other variants have been about the same idea all along?  Cloud Engineering is an emergent way of expressing how we use and enhance software engineering practices in a cloud world. This goes beyond application design and architecture, but includes how we build, deploy, and manage the services and applications that provide value to our users and customers.   In this talk I will step through the evolution of devops and how the practice of Cloud Engineering is a natural progression. I will take the traditional expression of CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing) and connect them to the build, deploy, and manage practices reflected in the Cloud Engineering discipline.   Cloud Engineering isn’t “the new DevOps”. It’s the evolution of everything we have been talking about for the last ten years (and more). Let’s learn how we can provide innovation, scale, reliability, security, and compliance by harnessing the practices across all of the associate disciplines. And maybe, along the way, “take DevOps back” to what it’s really been about all this time."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>We have been talking about devops for years. Along the way, we’ve added various syllables to the portmanteau “devops” to include all the practices and disciplines that are key to doing this effectively. What if DevOps, DevSecOps, and all the other variants have been about the same idea all along?</p>
<p>Cloud Engineering is an emergent way of expressing how we use and enhance software engineering practices in a cloud world. This goes beyond application design and architecture, but includes how we build, deploy, and manage the services and applications that provide value to our users and customers. </p>
<p>In this talk I will step through the evolution of devops and how the practice of Cloud Engineering is a natural progression. I will take the traditional expression of CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing) and connect them to the build, deploy, and manage practices reflected in the Cloud Engineering discipline. </p>
<p>Cloud Engineering isn’t “the new DevOps”. It’s the evolution of everything we have been talking about for the last ten years (and more). Let’s learn how we can provide innovation, scale, reliability, security, and compliance by harnessing the practices across all of the associate disciplines. And maybe, along the way, “take DevOps back” to what it’s really been about all this time.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Maddie Stratton: Let's take a journey to see how we got to where we are. In 2009, the first known use of the term DevOps took place in Ghent, Belgium. In 2019, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first DevOps days, we did a DevOps Days. Stratton says the movement has really grown over the years.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Donovan Brown at Microsoft has defined DevOps as the union of people, process and products. DevOps is about the people, the process, and the products. If we know what something isn't, maybe we can reason about what it is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 comms stands for culture, automation, lean measurement and sharing. Every one of these things is equally important. You can't directly change culture, but you can change behavior. And behavior becomes a culture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the things that we talk about in lean is this idea of a value stream map. And then we think about measurement. Measuring is really, really key because if we're talking about continuous improvement.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The more information we have, the better we can do our jobs. Sharing is also sharing practices and information. These were the principles that weve been talking about in the DevOps movement since 2010. But it's really become about automation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                From DevOps to cloud engineering, building the deploying and managing are three ways I like to slice them up. When we're using reusable shared things, we have a thing that makes us different, right? And then the culture part is a common development experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we apply software engineering practices to our deployment process, we can ensure that we ship the same way every time. The power of a checklist is defining the steps, not they're actually running it. automation can express our checklists in code, code that can be tested, reviewed and managed.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In cloud engineering, this is enabling fast feedback, which helps us see what's happening in our value stream. It's giving visibility into that entire supply chain of where all these places go. Part of cloud engineering is manage. We consider security and compliance to be integrated into our work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using common code, common principles around this really enables collaboration across your organization. This increases a common understanding across disciplines. It helps us see when our policy and value collide. And finally, the sharing just comes from that shared vocabulary.

              </li>
              
              <li>
