              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Aurmila Raju is a senior solution architect with Amazon Web Services. Today's session focuses on observability for modern event driven applications. EDA offers a lot of good things, but it's hard to get it right.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Event driven architecture is primarily based on the domain driven design and event storming methodology. You start from your business process, identify the events in each of the business domain, and then design your technical architecture based on that. End to end observability is key for a successful edge.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next service that we want to look at is Amazon Q service. SQS is a pull based event broker. Eventbridge is a push based broker. You can configure your dead letter queue and the number of retries based on your business SLA's. These metrics are written into or organized into cloud watches through namespaces and dimensions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The business logic in an event driven architecture is usually it's a lambda function. In that case you can instrument your code to create custom metrics and then send it into Cloudwatch. This is something that most applications will need for better performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is an out of the box feature in Cloudwatch for doing lambda insights. Some of the use cases where this might come in handy is identifying high cost functions, identifying memory leaks and identifying any performance changes. There are various mechanism where in which each of these areas can be fine tuned.

              </li>

                Cloudwatch logs can be collected from various services. API Gateway and Lambda. And also you can do custom metrics based on your logs. Can be useful on how it relates to business SLA's.

              <li>
                Next step is to derive insights similar to the lambda insights. New feature that has been announced is called a powered natural language query generation. The next way of doing some alarms is through CloudWatch anomaly deduction. Now it's time to move to the last two stages, which is advanced and proactive observability.

              <li>
                 pattern analysis in logging sites is a new feature that has been announced recently. It can be very useful in identifying the various patterns of logs that you have got in your application. If there is any out of ordinary pattern, it's going to automatically highlight it to you.

              <li>
                 AWS X ray can help you to do end to end view of requests flowing through an application. You can do it through Lambda and you can also do it on API gateway. What xray creates when all of these traces from these applications are reported back to x ray is it creates a service map.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloudwatch service lens is a single pane of glass which is going to help you to drill into your observability telemetry data. These best practices is not just for EDA, but for any application where you want to get started.

              <li>
                The next is tool selection. So choose the right tool for the job. Observability needs to be an internal process that everyone agrees on. As and when your application grows, your maturity model is going to grow. So that is my eight step process towards the best practices of observability.
