    <meta property="og:description" content="In an effort to automate tasks for our users we ended up creating a cloud (kind of). In this talk we will describe our journey towards automation, and how we accidentally created a Cloud on our Cloud and why we chose go to do it all.  Part of the job of a Developer Advocate is the ability to demo or show off portions of your technology stack to possible users. At IBM we run many workshops and tech demos every week for our clients and conferences. We need to create, monitor, maintain and clean these assets. In this talk we will describe our automation journey from bash scripts run and maintained by individual developers to automating the creations and deletion on automatic schedule with a UI. We will discuss situation, our iterations on what we tried and the painful portions of them, and how we accidentally created a Cloud interface on top of the IBM Cloud, or easier said, we created a Cloud on our Cloud.   Ideally, we’ll show our journey and the lessons we learned along the way, and as an audience member, you’ll come away with nuggets of useful tooling to make your cloud usage more streamlined, and hopefully, you’ll see the pitfalls we fell in and you can avoid them yourself. We’ll show off some bad code, some good code, and some robust code; all open source and in Go and available to allow you to leverage it too."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>In an effort to automate tasks for our users we ended up creating a cloud (kind of). In this talk we will describe our journey towards automation, and how we accidentally created a Cloud on our Cloud and why we chose go to do it all.</p>
<p>Part of the job of a Developer Advocate is the ability to demo or show off portions of your technology stack to possible users. At IBM we run many workshops and tech demos every week for our clients and conferences. We need to create, monitor, maintain and clean these assets. In this talk we will describe our automation journey from bash scripts run and maintained by individual developers to automating the creations and deletion on automatic schedule with a UI. We will discuss situation, our iterations on what we tried and the painful portions of them, and how we accidentally created a Cloud interface on top of the IBM Cloud, or easier said, we created a Cloud on our Cloud. </p>
<p>Ideally, we’ll show our journey and the lessons we learned along the way, and as an audience member, you’ll come away with nuggets of useful tooling to make your cloud usage more streamlined, and hopefully, you’ll see the pitfalls we fell in and you can avoid them yourself. We’ll show off some bad code, some good code, and some robust code; all open source and in Go and available to allow you to leverage it too.</p>

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Mophi is a software engineer and developer advocate at IBM. He mostly do container stuff, collect stickers and write go code. If you have any questions after or just want to connect, please feel free to find him at mophicodes.

              <li>
                Cloud is a very overloaded term. It means a lot of different things. In simplest term, cloud is someone else's computer. It's on demand and it has a way for users to access the service. As long as it has some way, it can be a cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                IBM has a cloud that we have a lot of workshops and other things that run. Each workshop requires about 30 of this Kubernetes cluster or openshift cluster to be spun up. The worst possible way to solve this problem would be for every request that comes in.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubmin is building an application that just automate a lot of these things using go. Uses the API to talk to the IBM cloud infrastructure and finally run post provisioning tasks on each cluster. Despite what's lacking, there is a huge impact of this UI makes it easy to teach anyone to create resources.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Should you build your own cloud interface? Do you often find yourself writing custom code to do things in your cloud? And do you struggle to keep the resources in check? Sometimes reinventing the wheel is the best way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have a react front end that sits in the cloud. Next, we needed to have some way of handling user authentication. Luckily we're already building on top of a cloud so we didn't really have to invent that wheel. We have a number of different steps we would like to finish to get to our ideal solutions.
