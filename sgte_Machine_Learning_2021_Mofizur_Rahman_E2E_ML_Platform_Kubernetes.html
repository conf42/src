    <meta property="og:description" content="Kubeflow is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes where users can develop, deploy, and manage ML workflows in a scalable and portable manner. Deploying and maintaining it can be a bit tricky since Kubeflow is composed of many components such as notebooks and pipelines and their potential configurations. This makes the barrier to entry to Kubeflow very high and make it difficult for teams to adopt Kubeflow.  To help alleviate some of these deployment woes the Kubernetes Kubeflow Operator was created. It automates the deployment, monitoring, and management of Kubeflow as a whole. In this session, users will learn how they can best leverage the Kubeflow Operator to quickly get Kubeflow up and running on their Kubernetes clusters."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Kubeflow is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes where users can develop, deploy, and manage ML workflows in a scalable and portable manner. Deploying and maintaining it can be a bit tricky since Kubeflow is composed of many components such as notebooks and pipelines and their potential configurations. This makes the barrier to entry to Kubeflow very high and make it difficult for teams to adopt Kubeflow.</p>
<p>To help alleviate some of these deployment woes the Kubernetes Kubeflow Operator was created. It automates the deployment, monitoring, and management of Kubeflow as a whole. In this session, users will learn how they can best leverage the Kubeflow Operator to quickly get Kubeflow up and running on their Kubernetes clusters.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                In this talk, we'll be talking about Qflow and how you can get an endtoend machine learning platform with just a few clicks. Most of the effort is still spent on that small, tiny block in the middle. But now more and more, it is a core part of every business.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                MLOps is these ability to apply DevOps principles to machine learning applications. If you're building software in 2021, I'm hoping you have embraced some of the DevOps practices. MLOps is trying to bring those same principles into the lifecycle of your machine learning models.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                MoFI is a software engineer and developer advocate at IBM. Most recently, he has been contributing to the Qflow upstream project into the manifest and deployment special interest group. If you have any questions after the conference, you can reach out to me.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An end to end machine learning platform covers everything from the start of the data to actually using that model into something useful in our application in our business. The pros of using one of the major cloud providers would be it is fully managed and works well with other cloud services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Qflow is an open source project that contains a curated set of tools and frameworks for machine learning workflows on kubernetes. Qflow is scalable, composable, portable, is open source, is industry supported and it's multitenant.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubeflow is an open source project and it's rapidly growing. Goal is to improve accountability for maintaining components. Manifests increase modularity. We have improved some of the Kubeflow deployment strategy. First time users should have a much smoother experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Qflow uses app id as authentication mechanism. You can define your pipelines using a Python DSL. On the same kubernetes cluster you could have multiple team members working simultaneously. In pipelines we can make use of those platforms to build our models in many ways.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Thank you so much for joining me in this session. Go to qflow. org to learn more about qflow and get started with Qflow. If you have any question to me, you can reach out to me at codes at any of the social media.
