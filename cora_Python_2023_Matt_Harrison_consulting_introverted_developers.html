              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Matt Wilson talks about consulting for introverted developers. The idea with consulting is that people are going to pay you for your expertise. If you're not super thrilled about being in front of people, then you might not want to do sales or marketing. Get an accountant if you are considering going this route.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of my work comes from my network and from interactions with others, and most of that is from conferences. A power tip that I would give you is that if you are introverted and you're like, I need to go network with people, well, flip it. Be the one who's dispersing the wisdom.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Writing a book is a great way to attract interest. It is an investment in yourself. It takes a bit of time, but it can pay dividends. Not just monetary dividends, but bring you work that pays more than writing the book would pay.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another thing that you can do to invest in yourself is to become a leader. This is something that a lot of technical people aren't particularly interested in doing or don't think that they can do. But with practice, you can learn to do it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next thing is to invest in others. There's more than enough work to go around. If you're willing to help others, that is a way for it to build trust. Be fair to clients, but also don't let them take advantage of you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Dunder M. Harrison: Just be charitable with yourself. Look on the positive side of things and then be willing to invest. If you're interested in training or consulting, reach out to me.
