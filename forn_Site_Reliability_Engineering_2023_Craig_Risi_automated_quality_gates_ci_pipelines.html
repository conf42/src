            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Craig Reezy is a software architect focused on test, automated and software testing. He is from Cape Town, South Africa. He talks about how to design software from the ground up to be of high quality.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Quality gates are checks and balances in place to make sure that we've covered certain angles. What I want to talk about now is really something that can actually be driven by your CI CD pipelines. It's really about how do we get things moving quicker.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I think that the next thing is to have a testable architecture. We need to build software that can be clearly tested. With that, obviously comes a strong focus on unit testing. You need to have automation throughout every aspect of your software.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need to think about testing from a much smaller perspective and rather focus on trying to reduce the scale of your software. You need tests that are very responsive, giving you quick feedback. And so you need to be thinking about software testing and your design not from this big perspective, but really from a small perspective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is a quality gate check? What is it really looking at? And there's a multitude of things that you can look at. If you can understand all these different things, you can build automated quality gates around these different measures.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you're building your software, you should be running your unit tests. Is the infrastructure healthy? Will it give me reliable results? Very important, code coverage. A good thing to aim for from a unit test perspective is 90% or above.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service performance is something that we can building into our quality gates. If you're in the cloud and you're scaling globally, you don't want to have any code that's not performant. We can build quality gates even if we might not think of defects and incidents within our CI pipelines.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to have something like 100% successful completion of all tests with a 90% code coverage. You can also automate all of those checks by utilizing linting tools in the build process. And you can put multiple checks into one quality gate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I've put here a high level example of a typical CI CD pipeline. It's a series of containers that are maybe now spinning up and testing the code in a bigger sort of way. These are things that can be checked and measured. I wouldn't typically put a load test in aCI CD pipeline because you generally don't want to put your system under load.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Quality gates can work through every little process of the cycle. They don't have to necessarily follow the sequential thing. Things like mutation testing can help. All of these things can be automated. But they don't necessarily need to be part of your pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's multiple ways of being able to build these things. Create your task within yaml and be able to define what it is that needs to be run. Then run through your CI before you then start doing your CD where you're actually taking things through more automated checks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If we don't have observability in our CI CD pipelines, we are losing out a lot of what value it can give us. The best thing to do is to take all the data, collect it from multiple sources and store it into a central location.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If we don't have some level of observability, we're not really understanding what's going on going on with our software. If you have that in place, you can start utilizing your quality gates to be able to build better software. I hope this talk has been helpful to many of you to start making changes in your software delivery process.
