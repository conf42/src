    <meta property="og:description" content="The journey of building a thriving open-source community is filled with challenges, lessons, and moments of triumph. In this talk, the former community manager of LitmusChaos shares an insider’s perspective on the evolution of the Chaos Engineering community. From nurturing the LitmusChaos project as it grew into a CNCF incubating project to scaling a global community of contributors, users, and advocates, this session highlights the key strategies, milestones, and stories that shaped its success. We will explore how chaos engineering principles resonated with the broader cloud-native ecosystem, fostering adoption and collaboration across diverse industries. The talk also delves into the challenges of scaling a community from scratch, balancing technical innovation with community needs, and fostering inclusivity and sustainability in open source.  Looking ahead, we’ll discuss the future of chaos engineering and its community, including emerging trends, potential integrations with other cloud-native technologies, and opportunities for contributors to shape the ecosystem’s direction. Whether you’re a chaos engineering enthusiast, a community leader, or simply curious about building vibrant open-source communities, this talk offers a blend of practical insights and inspiration for navigating the past, present, and future of chaos engineering.  Speaker Bio: Prithvi Raj is working as a Community Manager & Developer Advocate at Mirantis and is leading the community efforts for the Open Source Program Office at Mirantis including the k0rdent project, k0s project, k0smortron, and the other OSS projects Mirantis is contributing to. He previously led the LitmusChaos project community, the CNCF incubating project based on Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering, and has helped scale a community of 3000+ folks from scratch. He is also a CNCF Ambassador and has closely worked with the CNCF community to run LFX Mentorship programs and helped build a Chaos Engineering community in the CNCF ecosystem.  He has worked on global events, conferences, and meetups such as Chaos Carnival, Kubernetes Community Days Bengaluru & Chennai, CNCF Kubernetes Chaos Engineering Meetups, and more to help grow various communities in the DevOps ecosystem."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>The journey of building a thriving open-source community is filled with challenges, lessons, and moments of triumph. In this talk, the former community manager of LitmusChaos shares an insider’s perspective on the evolution of the Chaos Engineering community. From nurturing the LitmusChaos project as it grew into a CNCF incubating project to scaling a global community of contributors, users, and advocates, this session highlights the key strategies, milestones, and stories that shaped its success.
We will explore how chaos engineering principles resonated with the broader cloud-native ecosystem, fostering adoption and collaboration across diverse industries. The talk also delves into the challenges of scaling a community from scratch, balancing technical innovation with community needs, and fostering inclusivity and sustainability in open source.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we’ll discuss the future of chaos engineering and its community, including emerging trends, potential integrations with other cloud-native technologies, and opportunities for contributors to shape the ecosystem’s direction. Whether you’re a chaos engineering enthusiast, a community leader, or simply curious about building vibrant open-source communities, this talk offers a blend of practical insights and inspiration for navigating the past, present, and future of chaos engineering.</p>
<p>Speaker Bio: Prithvi Raj is working as a Community Manager &amp; Developer Advocate at Mirantis and is leading the community efforts for the Open Source Program Office at Mirantis including the k0rdent project, k0s project, k0smortron, and the other OSS projects Mirantis is contributing to. He previously led the LitmusChaos project community, the CNCF incubating project based on Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering, and has helped scale a community of 3000+ folks from scratch.
He is also a CNCF Ambassador and has closely worked with the CNCF community to run LFX Mentorship programs and helped build a Chaos Engineering community in the CNCF ecosystem.</p>
<p>He has worked on global events, conferences, and meetups such as Chaos Carnival, Kubernetes Community Days Bengaluru &amp; Chennai, CNCF Kubernetes Chaos Engineering Meetups, and more to help grow various communities in the DevOps ecosystem.</p>
