    <meta property="og:description" content="It’s no secret that the deployment of the Machine Learning models conceptually is far from training those models and requires a different mindset. Some deal with it by having people dedicated to work on deployment since there’s actually a lot to do even when the model is still in the development phase and some just expect data scientists to do everything from modeling and analysis to deployment and monitoring.   In this talk I’d like to share my experience with deployment starting from 2017 as well as the lessons I’ve learned. Wait for a couple of wild and sometimes embarrassing stories but at least (oops) I didn’t do it again.  "/>

<p>It’s no secret that the deployment of the Machine Learning models conceptually is far from training those models and requires a different mindset. Some deal with it by having people dedicated to work on deployment since there’s actually a lot to do even when the model is still in the development phase and some just expect data scientists to do everything from modeling and analysis to deployment and monitoring. </p>
<p>In this talk I’d like to share my experience with deployment starting from 2017 as well as the lessons I’ve learned. Wait for a couple of wild and sometimes embarrassing stories but at least (oops) I didn’t do it again. </p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we are going to talk about deploying machine learning models. During model training you're basically focusing on having the model and making it better. During deployment you are focusing on preserving your model. It's highly important to keep the quality of your code high, also to write tests.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first story is about scaling, and basically it's about the moment when I developed my first ever model. I think I deployed more than 20 models using that prediction service and trying to scale that. The lesson that I learned there is that it's super important to plan your deploying thoroughly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When there is just one person responsible for something, it never ends well. Delegation is super important, like delegate if you can. Another important issue here is synchronization of tasks. And it's important to remember that you are not alone in the company.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So the next story is about data scientists and no need for tests. We deployed prediction service without tests, like zero tests. Software engineering doesn't require as much tests as data scientists do. Also, it's easier to write tests than to fix bugs in production.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Even some quite big companies have this habit of not monitoring what they are doing with their models. Monitoring is crucial for so many things. It helps you to understand when you need to improve your solution. Data scientists work is not just about building models. It's more about finding the answer to questions.
              </li>
