    <meta property="og:description" content="We take for granted being able to find a gas station on our phone, but those maps not only help find that needed coffee fix - they help scientists and first responders save lives. We’ll talk about the impact maps can have and the challenges in developing these tools with Javascript and the JAMstack.  ​Working on building apps and interfaces is as challenging as it is rewarding. On one hand, being able to work on tools scientists use every day and giving first responders the ability to help save lives is rewarding in itself, but getting to those goals is technically challenging considering building an application with useful map features, making it intuitive, and having infrastructure behind it that gives the map the features needed to be useful in the first place."/>

<p>We take for granted being able to find a gas station on our phone, but those maps not only help find that needed coffee fix - they help scientists and first responders save lives. We’ll talk about the impact maps can have and the challenges in developing these tools with Javascript and the JAMstack.</p>
<p>​Working on building apps and interfaces is as challenging as it is rewarding. On one hand, being able to work on tools scientists use every day and giving first responders the ability to help save lives is rewarding in itself, but getting to those goals is technically challenging considering building an application with useful map features, making it intuitive, and having infrastructure behind it that gives the map the features needed to be useful in the first place.</p>

                Colby Fayock: We're going to talk about maps and the impact they can have on the world. He'll also dive into how you can build them with little bit of javascript. How do we get the data to build out all these features?

              <li>
                Maps are literally giving people tools to save the world. By taking collected data and applying into a map, we're providing another visualization medium for scientists. How does all this stuff actually work?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The base map is the actual cake. Then you have your overlays that are your icing, and then you have some data sprinkled on top. On top of your data can literally be anything, such as active fires or evacuation zones. Some data is free, some of it's not.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 element 84 is a tool for first responders and disasters scenarios to have a really easy to use UI. It can upload data directly to an AWS snowball edge, which is basically a cloud in a box. The hope here is that it can help first responders get the information they need to be more productive in the field.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The summer road trip demo can actually be used as a Gatsby starter. You can instantly spin up a new road trip mapping app. This works for anywhere in the world, not just the United States. The tools available make this accessible for anybody to use.

                I just launched a course on egghead IO that walks you through building a map from scratch for a react app. I also have a bunch of free lessons available if you're not ready to quite dive into a course yet. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about mapping or anything else about the jamstack.
