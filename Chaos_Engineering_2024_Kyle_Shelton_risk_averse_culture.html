<p>This presentation delves into the art of advocating for Chaos Engineering in environments where conservative leadership prevails. It is tailored to address the challenges of introducing progressive tech practices in risk-averse settings. Attendees will learn effective communication strategies to convey the significance and benefits of Chaos Engineering, overcoming misconceptions and resistance from traditional management structures. The talk will include actionable insights, real-world case studies, and a guide to navigating the cultural and organizational hurdles in advocating for innovative tech solutions.</p>

                Kyle Shelton is a senior DevOps consultant for Toyota Racing development. He'll talk about the evolution of distributed systems and what apps look like today versus what they look like 1015 years ago. He will also go over the principles of chaos engineering and how to deal with a conservative mindset.

              <li>
                When I first got started in my career, I was working for Verizon and we were deploying VoLTE. Now if you're deploying an app with the cloud native revolution, you can do that within 45 minutes. Understanding what happens when things break is crucial for modern day applications.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If there's a skill set that I'm constantly trying to grow, it's my sales skill set. I had to ask an executive for a couple of start a soccer team for our office. Being able to sell is very important. I personally hate going slow, but slow is steady sometimes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do we sell chaos engineering? One of the biggest things is total cost ownership. Being able to put a number on reliability is key in settings chaos engineering. Another way to gain buy in is just ask for small pilot programs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you're dealing with big data systems, it's very difficult to predict things that are going to happen, especially in the cloud. The only way to do that is practice. I highly suggest asking for this and asking to be able to test and to run your red team exercises and to practice your incidents.
