    <meta property="og:description" content="Let's talk about some experiences, learnings and failures. Your asking about our learning environment? Well there you go: 300+ microservices, 100+ developers, 100+ Gamedays, countless experiments with various outcomes :)  Have you ever been to the circus? As software developers, we have much more in common with circus trainers than we think. On the one hand, we have to tame and maintain a steadily growing zoo of technologies and on the other hand, the undesirable audience expects us to show more and more astonishing features within a short period of time. On top of that, we’re also shooting right into the circus ring with our big CI/CD cannon. That can lead to interesting effects, because we’re shooting while a show is running. In this session you will learn about our top 5 excuses not to do Chaos Engineering and how even the most hostile environment can be used to do Chaos Engineering. Whatever your role is, product owner or developer, we will share our experience in establishing a chaos engineering centered culture at DB Vertrieb for future ringmasters to withstand turbulent conditions in production and ultimately to satisfy your customer's expectations."/>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some experiences, learnings and failures. Your asking about our learning environment? Well there you go: 300+ microservices, 100+ developers, 100+ Gamedays, countless experiments with various outcomes :)</p>
<p>Have you ever been to the circus?
As software developers, we have much more in common with circus trainers than we think. On the one hand, we have to tame and maintain a steadily growing zoo of technologies and on the other hand, the undesirable audience expects us to show more and more astonishing features within a short period of time. On top of that, we’re also shooting right into the circus ring with our big CI/CD cannon. That can lead to interesting effects, because we’re shooting while a show is running.
In this session you will learn about our top 5 excuses not to do Chaos Engineering and how even the most hostile environment can be used to do Chaos Engineering.
Whatever your role is, product owner or developer, we will share our experience in establishing a chaos engineering centered culture at DB Vertrieb for future ringmasters to withstand turbulent conditions in production and ultimately to satisfy your customer&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                This talk focuses on the implementation and operation of chaos engineering. Deutsche Bahn is the biggest train operating group in Germany. Chaos engineering makes my system capable to withstand turbulent conditions in production. Why we are rolling out chaos engineering at Davy for clear is the last topic we cover.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A new feature which connects the new platform and the old agent monolithic went silently down. Customers started complaining online. Concerns regarding our new platform were expressed from all directions. Only knowing who is responsible will not prevent us from future outage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have a gap between Devon Ops and architecture. We wanted to get faster with lets errors and a better ux. So we used chaos engineering to mitigate those problems. Without plan, we felt like chaos Engineering has won the worst initiative of the year.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You just need to start doing chaos engineering. It helps you verify the non functional requirements. It increases cross team communication to reduce friction. And it increases the overall resilience of the system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Five top five excuses not to start with chaos engineering. Invest in a great application performance monitoring solution. Stress out the value of chaos engineering for the product. Host some game days.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Get stakeholders together in game days to test the system and to learn more about it. Start small and aim for production. Share your findings with other teams. Even big organizations can do chaos engineering if they want to.
              </li>
