<p>CI/CD is now a part of software development. We review our code and make sure it is safe to deploy to production. However, what about SQL queries? Do we make sure they will work in a production environment? In this talk weâ€™&rsquo;ll track metrics, analyze queries, and use Metis for automation.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                In the next like 40 minutes, we are going to track a little bit about CI CD pipelines. How to make sure that we prevent the bad code from reaching production. How do you know that the code you deploy to production is actually going to work well?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another thingy is the third area we'd like to discuss is completely different context and completely different workload when we run in production. That's because there's completely different country, different environment you're running in. What kind of issues can you capture when running unit tests or when running integration tests?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We will cover databases, we will cover orm libraries, and we'll finally cover lack of context and lack of understanding of all the moving pieces around. For instance, we may get slow queries that work pretty well on your testing environment but do not work in production. How can we fix that in that case?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Even though they are equivalent, they work completely differently. Unit tests will not capture, and especially your CI CD pipeline may not capture the performance characteristics. Another thing we may hit is incompatible changes in schemas when deploying to production.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The model we store in our object oriented applications is different than the model in our SQL databases. Even strings is something that may be very prone to the impedance mismatch. Another thing with RMS is they lack the visibility, meaning there are so many moving pieces that rms take care of.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do you deal with heterogeneous scenario when you have multiple applications talking to the same database? And how do you test whether your migration is going to run fast enough? With the typical CI CD pipeline with no database guardrails, we have no idea how it's working.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to understand how SQL queries are executed, we need to understand SQL engine. To do that we can use the modern observability tooling, which is called open telemetry. Open telemetry allows us to capture logs, track metrics from our applications to provide better observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Matis integrates with your source code with various languages, various orms, various databases. It analyzes your pull requests, merge requests, for instance in GitHub actions. Built proper database guardrails into your CI CD pipeline. Hope you enjoyed the rest of your conference.
