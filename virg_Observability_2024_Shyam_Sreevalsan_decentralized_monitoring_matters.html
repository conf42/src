              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                NetData is an open source observability platform. Its goal is to shake up the observability landscape and make monitoring easy for everyone. Shyam Srivalsan explains how observability works. It's mostly in the form of dashboards. Another important component is alerting.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Centralized monitoring or centralized observability is the default setting today. The tools that we're talking about are centralizing metrics, logs, traces, checks, all of this information into some sort of a central monitoring server. There is a big bucket and that's what we're going to have a deep dive into.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                F fidelity is sort of a mixture of granularity and cardinality. If you have low granularity, which means that let's say you're collecting data every 60 seconds, this is in effect blurry data. Centralization makes cost and fidelity proportional to each other.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Centralized data storage is expensive. High data egress. Scaling costs grow disproportionately. And number four is accuracy. Cost is a huge problem when it comes to centralized monitoring solutions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it comes to machine learning, as you must have heard, it's all about the data. How accurate your machine learning is is based on how much data you have. Having to do it in a centralized fashion means that you have to have so much context built in. This leads to outages and downtime.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The centralized monitoring solution has a single point of failure, which is your single server. Now, if you had more localized ways into looking at your individual pieces of your infrastructure, you're centralized view could be down. And then we have efficiency. Infrastructure takes up around 30% of the total energy consumption in the world.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Data privacy is something that is often talked about, that large tech companies have an often unhealthy liking for customer data. There is a concentration of risk when it comes to centralized systems. The other aspect to this is compliance challenges. And finally, there's the question of deployment options.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The one solution that I'm proposing here on this talk is to decentralize. Every single node has individual identity and entity. This gives us a lot more option to have higher fidelity data. There's a lot of advantages to be had from decentralized networks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Keep data at the edge. Make the data highly available across the network. Unify and integrate all of this at query time. These are some of the challenges also of making decentralized observability work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Net data aims to achieve the decentralized philosophy that we've been talking about. The main component is the net data agent, which collects data in real time. The agent can also stream data to other agents. And the really important thing which allows Netdata to deploy this decentralized philosophy is that the netdata agent is really lightweight.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Net data parents are other net data agents which are aggregating data across multiple children. Having access to these parents or mini centralization points gives you enhanced scalability and flexibility. It ensures that all of the data remains always on Prem. And by design, it's resilient and fault tolerant.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Netada's decentralized architecture enables horizontal scalability. The cloud is just querying the data in real time and it's just showing it to you. I would welcome you to explore how decentralized monitoring looks and feels.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Creating a decentralized observability platform is not easy. Changing from a centralized architecture to a decentralized architecture is even harder. Big players in the industry will find it really hard to move away from their existing architecture. I believe that the future is decentralized and that hard problems can be solved.
              </li>
