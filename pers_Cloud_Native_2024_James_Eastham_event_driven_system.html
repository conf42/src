              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                In his bestselling 2014 book, Homo Sapiens Yuval Noir, Harare discusses a brief history of humankind. Stories and words are the master key that unlock human potential. You're going to learn the secrets of event driven architecture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                James Eastham is a senior cloud architect at AWS. He talks about the benefits and challenges of event driven architecture. He says there are many different types of coupling. The appropriate level of coupling depends on the level of control you have over the endpoints.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An event driven architecture lets you tell the story of your business through its technical implementation. Both types of systems trigger functionality using events, but in an event driven system, events are business events.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Your event schema is your API in event driven systems. It's the language your services use to talk to each other. How you structure your events can be a deal breaker for the success of your system. Making events first class citizens means focusing on event first design.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An event driven system is made up of three parts. An event producer, a central broker of some kind, and then some kind of event consumer. The primary integration pattern at play is the publish subscribe pattern. As a subscriber, you're now in charge of controlling the load on your own system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 governance is really important in event driven systems. To make a breaking change to your events, you simply introduce an RFC. An alternate approach to metadata data is to use the cloud events specification. But without the right governance and versioning in place, that can cause problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An example of an eventually consistent transaction. All the different services in your system will converge on the same view of the world. Eventually consistency is one of the trade offs you make when you build eventor and systems. You simply need to embrace it and architect for it correctly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The crux of your business logic happens using events asynchronously. Commands are typically at the boundaries of your system, where it interacts with the external world API request coming in. Don't try to make your entire system driven by events, start small.
              </li>
