            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                The written word is powerful. It can get you into trouble if you're not careful. But it also has the power to level up your career. Here are five ways to improve the quality of your writing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                After grad school, I started working as a software engineer. My manager recommended that I begin answering questions on our user forums. I eventually ranked in the top 1% of users on our forums in terms of reputation points. Writing to users improved my career at a company and then helped me pivot to a different career.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Your users might be internal at your company or external users of your product. Help them. There are so many ways you can do this. Take a look at your career ladder or talk with your manager to discover what you need to do to progress to the next level.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Second strategy for writing in order to level up your career is to write to educate the tech community. The more you write, the more you will become known as the go to person on a topic. It's going to get your name out there for potential new roles.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third way to level up your career: Write to document team knowledge. Document team knowledge and processes so that your team can easily keep moving forward. Finally, document team processes it's not nice to feel needed at 03:00 a. m.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of us are not natural encouragers. Set a reminder on your calendar every Friday to encourage a teammate. When someone does great work, celebrate it and let others know about it. All of these efforts can help create a culture of compliments on your team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Your performance review is your chance to make a case for yourself as to why your manager should give you a bonus, a raise, or a promotion. Set aside time, weekly or monthly, to document what you've accomplished. Taking the time to document your accomplishments can help you at your current company and help your career prospects at other companies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Five strategies for writing to level up your career. Write to help your users, educate the tech community, document team knowledge. What strategy can you try over the next month? Write it down. Make a commitment to yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't be a jerk. Use inclusive language, even if you don't care about being inclusive. The words you choose matter. Set aside time for writing. You will get better just by practicing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can use an aipowered writing assistant like Grammarly to teach you. Another way to educate yourself is to find a writing partner. Set up regular writing reviews to get feedback. There are so many ways to learn to be a better writer.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use the power of the written word to level up your technical career. Here are three ways to improve the quality of your writing. Once again, I encourage you to think about what you want to try over the next month.
