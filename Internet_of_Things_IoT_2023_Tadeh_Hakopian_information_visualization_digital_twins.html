                This is the next phase of IoT and information and visualization with digital twins. A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical object or system. The ingredients of digital twins is IoT, cloud, and data. Why do people use them with IoT devices?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a whole world of digital twins and visualization I'd like to get into. Data standards are important. It's more important about the shared language of the ways you go about getting started and accomplishing tasks. A digital twin consortium brings a lot of different standards.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                IoT and digital twins means converting a lot of things to other things. From manufacturing to urban design to point clouds to surveying, there's so many different solutions out there. Keep it simple. Don't feel overwhelmed.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A given house or apartment has multiple digitally connected Internet connect devices, thermometers, security cameras, door cameras. You can hook these up and make your own custom IoT edge devices. With a modest investment, you can avoid serious cost overruns.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next part here, we'll talk about the actual visualization of the digital twin environment. What you want to do is make sure that what you have is useful to the end user. You want to keep these pretty straightforward and effective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                3d models are a great way to show up an area space that requires area spatial data. In this example, there is a training going on for industrial equipment using digital twins. These models can be used to help workers understand the equipment they're using.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The sooner you get started, the easier it is to change. You want to be on the leading edge of the adoption curve. The environment around IoT digital twins and the visualization constantly changes. There are many steps that you do have to be aware of.
