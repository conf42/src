              <li>
                Covid-19 is a cloud security catalyst. In the next 40, 45 minutes, we'll talk about security, about cloud security and how the last one year, one year and a half impacted the way. How cloud and how security is taken into consideration by organizations moving to cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                From 2020 to 2021, cloud security become very important. Working from home increased the phishing scam with 45%. Around half a million people globally were affected by security breaches.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud workloads increased in the last one year, 83% was on chemical manufacturers. Even if you don't protect your data with strong username and passwords, especially passwords, they can be very easily broken. Find the right balance between premium security that each cloud vendor is offering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developers should never have access directly for long periods of time on environments, testing or pre production where customer data are used or sensitive data. Remember that segregation of teams, roles and responsibilities is very, very important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing that we can do is limit the use of the cloud preview services and features. The most stronger thing is to educate all the organization about cloud security. Try to educate at a minimal level.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using Azure site access signature or AWS signature together with them we can have the power to limit the access to anonymous users to our storage. This combined with firewall rules can create a system that is more robust, more secure. How can we ensure that default security features of cloud services are active all the time?
