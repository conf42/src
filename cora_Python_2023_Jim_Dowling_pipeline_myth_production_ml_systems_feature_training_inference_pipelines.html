    <meta property="og:description" content="Developers often erroneously talk about ML pipelines. But real-world ML systems have many moving components, not a single monolithic ML pipeline. In this talk, we show how to build ML systems as a composition of feature pipelines, training pipelines, and inference pipelines with a shared data layer."/>

<p>Developers often erroneously talk about ML pipelines. But real-world ML systems have many moving components, not a single monolithic ML pipeline. In this talk, we show how to build ML systems as a composition of feature pipelines, training pipelines, and inference pipelines with a shared data layer.</p>

              <li>
                Jim Dowling: How we can refactor this monolithic machine learning pipeline that many of you may have heard about before into what we call feature training and inference pipelines. He says it's too complex to make anything easy for developers to put in production or for people to maintain.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In Python, we're not going to use infrastructure. We're going to talk about the way in which we advocate for structuring these machine learning systems to make it easier to manage them. What we typically have are three main components, the feature pipeline, the training pipeline, and the inference pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The feature pipeline will take your raw data, it'll compute features from it that's compressed signal that we're going to use to train our models with and also to make predictions with. Features can be stored online and offline via both the online and streaming API.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We can do batch inference with the feature view as well. For feature views we can specify specific features that we'd like to transform. This ensures consistency of these transformation functions between this training pipeline and this inference pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can write Python programs in a very nice tool called modal. It basically can schedule Python programs for you. This is a really nice way to build what we call serverless machine learning systems. There's a bunch of these on the Internet.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a ton of them here in Hopsterick's tutorials. The one I'm going to show you briefly here is called credit scores. This is a really good way of doing synthetic feature pipelines if you can't access the actual data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 app hopsearch AI is free to create an account. It's time unlimited. You can build systems on it. The feature view you can create is the selection of features. And then we can see any training data sets created from it. These two notebooks really make the two the production system.
