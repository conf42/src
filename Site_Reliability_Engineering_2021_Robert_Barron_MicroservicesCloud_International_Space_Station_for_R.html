    <meta property="og:description" content="The International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for over 20 years. It was not launched fully formed, as a monolith in space. Instead, it is built out of dozens of individual modules, each with a dedicated role - life support, engineering, science, commercial applications and more.  Each module (or container) functions as a microservice, adding additional capabilities to the whole.  Not only do the modules need to function together, delivering both functional and non-functional capabilities, they were designed, developed and built by different countries on Earth and once launched into space (deployed in multiple different ways), had to work together - perfectly.  Despite the many (minor) reliability issues which have occurred over the decades, the ISS remains a highly reliable platform for cutting edge scientific and engineering research.  In this session I will describe the way the space station was developed and the lessons Site Reliability and DevOps Engineers can learn from it."/>

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>The International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for over 20 years. It was not launched fully formed, as a monolith in space. Instead, it is built out of dozens of individual modules, each with a dedicated role - life support, engineering, science, commercial applications and more. 
Each module (or container) functions as a microservice, adding additional capabilities to the whole. 
Not only do the modules need to function together, delivering both functional and non-functional capabilities, they were designed, developed and built by different countries on Earth and once launched into space (deployed in multiple different ways), had to work together - perfectly.</p>
<p>Despite the many (minor) reliability issues which have occurred over the decades, the ISS remains a highly reliable platform for cutting edge scientific and engineering research.</p>
<p>In this session I will describe the way the space station was developed and the lessons Site Reliability and DevOps Engineers can learn from it.</p>

              <li>
                Robert Barron is an AI ops and site reliability engineer solution architect in IBM. He explains how the International Space Station is similar to the microservices we are developing today. You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native.

              <li>
                In the early days of space exploration, we were going out into space, seeing what it's like. Modern space stations are very modular space stations, where you construct them in stages. Time goes by and this is the blueprint for future space exploration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Simon is an independently flying assistant who can keep up with an astronaut and assist him or her with whatever they're doing. The International Space Station didn't actually start in 1988. International cooperation between countries was the thing that made the space station happen. The smallest things can cause the largest headaches.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Monoliths are simpler, even if they might be wasteful and more expensive in the long term. Technical debt is the biggest problem that we have in the industry. Technology is cool, but the business and the politics of the business is vital.

                 IBM working together with NASA, with HP, with other partners in order to deploy a unique version of cloud computing far, far above the cloud. Here are two links which will lead you down the rabbit hole into a lot of further information. Thank you and enjoy the rest of the conference.
