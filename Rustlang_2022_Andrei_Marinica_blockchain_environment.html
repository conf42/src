              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Andre Marinika is from the Internet scale blockchain. This presentation is aimed more at rust enthusiasts and rust programmers. So, without further ado, let's get going.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The title of today is pushing Rust to the limit in a blockchain environment. This presentation will have three parts. The first part is a primer on what we're trying to achieve. The second is a collection of fun little tales about stuff we encountered. The third part is about solutions we came up with to fix problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Elrond is a super fast and cheap layer. One blockchain. We have a lot of very cool features. Something we pride ourselves very much in is the great Dapps, both mobile and on the web. We hope we're going to end up being on every person's cell phone or web browser in the world soon.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are trying to be the fastest blockchain on the planet. We opted instead for Webassembly. Contract size for us is crucial, aka byteco size. You want to build a smart contract that is as small as possible. Here is a high level overview of how to build an efficient smart contract framework.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The second thing you want to do in a framework is make it pretty. High level code has to be pretty. The programmer has to look at the code and say, yeah, that's an addition. It's actually one of the most important things when you're designing a framework.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When designing frameworks, what abstractions do you choose? For instance, here we chose to make all the contracts traits. Now contracts can call each other as if nothing happened. And now another short story about the first arguably useful smart contract.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So if contracts can call each other so elegantly, why not call them from outside of the blockchain? Rust is magic enough that you can do that. And now I want to talk to you about some even more interesting stuff, some stories, some stuff that we just happened along the way. There's going to be three exhibits.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In rust, you just use a result. Results are super cool. There's a problem, though. We didn't want the result at all, actually. We wanted to have something that replaces the result completely. And we cut 20% of some of the smart contracts with this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a lot more to be talked about, but of course I had to keep it within reasonable bounds. You can find me on telegram, you can email me. Just email me directly and I hope to see you soon. Have a nice day.
              </li>
