              <li>
                Tom Henricksen: Why don't people understand me? He says to gain respect, we need to know the technology. He says a leader shared how he was failing delegation. John said he wanted his team to be more like bank tellers and financial planners. Each change John made made his team better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Coding skills got you the job, influence will get you the career. Developers are focusing on technology skills only if we truly want to set ourselves apart. We need to know how to influence and collaboration with teams.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Software development can be a bit like trending song sales on iTunes. We need to be good at our work and get along with our team. The first skills I had to master as a developer were debugging. If we put our sole focus on these skills, our careers will falter.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Getting fired gives us good chance to reflect. What did we do wrong? How could this have been avoided? The second lesson I learned was the importance of relationship management. Even in something as trying as getting fired can be a moment for learning.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Communication, relationships, and influence are the three core soft skills. L-U-C and K listen, understand their interest, connect and apply the knowledge. With luck you can find influence. They can change your career.
