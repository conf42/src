    <meta property="og:description" content="Enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) security today is analogous to IT security in the mid 1990s. It was a time when security awareness was limited, countermeasures and best practices weren’t broadly applied, and attackers explored, compromised, controlled, and exfiltrated data from systems with minimal resistance. In short, enterprise IoT security sucks as bad today as that unpatched Windows NT 3.51 server with an RS-232 connected modem that IT forgot about.  Working globally with Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies we’ve interrogated over two million production IoT devices. Across these two million devices we’ve identified threats and trends, compiled statistics, summarized compelling cases, and evaluated common offenders. We’ve also assembled tactics that organizations can employ to recognize value from their IoT devices while minimizing risk and ensuring that devices that are secure today will stay secure tomorrow.  Security issues are compounded by the quantity of IoT devices. Our analysis indicates that most organizations have about five IoT devices per employee. The global IoT market has grown from $100 billion in 2017 to over $1 trillion in 2022. There are over 46 billion connected devices today and 30 billion (65%) of those devices are IoT. We are increasingly dependent on consumer, enterprise, industrial, and military IoT devices for cost reduction, supply chain logistics, productivity gains, security, and everything in between. Despite the criticality of IoT, our security hasn’t kept pace. In the enterprise, we’ve identified that we simply don’t know:  ●        What IoT devices we have - guesses based on legacy asset discovery solutions are consistently off by at least 50% ●        When our firmware was last updated - in many cases the firmware is end of life and the average IoT firmware age is six years  ●        If our credentials follow organizational policies - passwords that are default, low-quality, don’t have scheduled rotations, and lack centralized management are the norm ●        How vulnerable our IoT devices are - at least half of the IoT devices we’ve interrogated have known, high to critical level CVEs   While enterprise IoT security currently sucks, it doesn’t have to be that way. By evaluating the security risks and the inherent limitations of IoT, you can leverage tactics that will have a rapid and positive impact on security.  Attendee takeaways:  ●        Discover your IoT devices, diagnose their security, and define their limitations ●        Employ tactics to improve your IoT security and communicate their status to stakeholders ●        Restate key findings derived from the interrogation of two million production IoT devices"/>

              Abstract
            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>Enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) security today is analogous to IT security in the mid 1990s. It was a time when security awareness was limited, countermeasures and best practices weren’t broadly applied, and attackers explored, compromised, controlled, and exfiltrated data from systems with minimal resistance. In short, enterprise IoT security sucks as bad today as that unpatched Windows NT 3.51 server with an RS-232 connected modem that IT forgot about.</p>
<p>Working globally with Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies we’ve interrogated over two million production IoT devices. Across these two million devices we’ve identified threats and trends, compiled statistics, summarized compelling cases, and evaluated common offenders. We’ve also assembled tactics that organizations can employ to recognize value from their IoT devices while minimizing risk and ensuring that devices that are secure today will stay secure tomorrow.</p>
<p>Security issues are compounded by the quantity of IoT devices. Our analysis indicates that most organizations have about five IoT devices per employee. The global IoT market has grown from $100 billion in 2017 to over $1 trillion in 2022. There are over 46 billion connected devices today and 30 billion (65%) of those devices are IoT. We are increasingly dependent on consumer, enterprise, industrial, and military IoT devices for cost reduction, supply chain logistics, productivity gains, security, and everything in between. Despite the criticality of IoT, our security hasn’t kept pace. In the enterprise, we’ve identified that we simply don’t know:</p>
<p>●        What IoT devices we have - guesses based on legacy asset discovery solutions are consistently off by at least 50%
●        When our firmware was last updated - in many cases the firmware is end of life and the average IoT firmware age is six years 
●        If our credentials follow organizational policies - passwords that are default, low-quality, don’t have scheduled rotations, and lack centralized management are the norm
●        How vulnerable our IoT devices are - at least half of the IoT devices we’ve interrogated have known, high to critical level CVEs </p>
<p>While enterprise IoT security currently sucks, it doesn’t have to be that way. By evaluating the security risks and the inherent limitations of IoT, you can leverage tactics that will have a rapid and positive impact on security.</p>
<p>Attendee takeaways: 
●        Discover your IoT devices, diagnose their security, and define their limitations
●        Employ tactics to improve your IoT security and communicate their status to stakeholders
●        Restate key findings derived from the interrogation of two million production IoT devices</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Brian Contos: XioT security sucks, a story of 2 million interrogated devices. IoT is a combination of three disk but overlapping areas. The first is what we might consider enterprise IoT, or Internet of things. The second is the OT or industrial control system side SCADA devices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have about 5 million cameras. We have over a quarter million voiceover IP phones, printers, about 83,000. Over 13,000 ups systems connected. IoT devices don't need to be Internet accessible to be attacked and manipulated.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The easiest way to get into a lot of these devices are, number one, is it Internet accessible. And number two, does it run the default creds? That's all the hacking is involved. Nation states are taking interest in these types of tools. In the United States, weve actually passed a law that prohibits the use of many of the devices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The Marai botnet was kind of the Godfather, or the grandfather, if you will, of Xiot attacks. Even though they started with cameras, this expanded was past cameras and started including printers and phones and other devices as well. We still see devices today that are still vulnerable to these.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and other countries working together took down a botnet. Primarily targeted in the IoT realm, the OT devices, those PLC skated devices. Could they have been used for more nefarious things like blowing up a pipeline?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of these devices operate with no authentication. Siemens came out with some suggestions to fix this attack. Patch your firmware, set a username and password, and get rid of services that you don't need. Security today is kind of like iT security was like back in 1995.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                About half of Xiot devices operate with default passwords. 26% of the devices operating with end of life firmware. The remaining 74% of devices on average is six years old. This is really making things easy for the bad guys.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                These devices are super vulnerable and they're being exploited at a very, very high rate. KVM switches, server cabinets and racks are among the worst offenders. Physical access controllers suck. These are simple areas to attack.

                Another one are printers. Everyone's got them. They're super promiscuous. If they're all or possibly a great majority of them can be compromised and used to attack you. That's a huge attack surface.

                Security cameras often run operating systems like busybox and other forms of Linux. There's exploits to take advantage of them, like we saw with the Hikvision camera. Most people don't have in the enterprise a handful, they have thousands. Nobody wants to take responsibility.

              <li>
                Beyond the enterprise, things actually has a global impact, right, on cities and counties and states and countries and regions. Everything everywhere always is going to be connected with these devices, and hopefully we can get them beyond 1995 security.

                In hardening, you might say, you know what, I only want to run wired. Now I get into credentials and certs. These enterprise XioT security platforms can talk to all these devices. You can be very fine grained in how you push it out.

                Brian Contos: Organizations don't know what they have, so discovery is so important. The XioT problem is growing exponentially. It's a much larger footprint than traditional endpoint devices or cloud combined. There are solutions now. Take a look at your IoT environment.
