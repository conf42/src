    <meta property="og:description" content="With heavy advancements in Java, the number and scale of deployments are ever increasing. With such growth, understanding how to debug memory and CPU performance issues related to the java application and JVM are critical to ensure smooth operation.   This presentation will talk about performance issue scenarios and provide an overview of tools/scripts/processes to triage and eventually understand the problem to a level where the next step would be to fix it. We will go through heap dumps, thread dumps, process crash logs etc"/>

<p>With heavy advancements in Java, the number and scale of deployments are ever increasing. With such growth, understanding how to debug memory and CPU performance issues related to the java application and JVM are critical to ensure smooth operation.</p>
<p>This presentation will talk about performance issue scenarios and provide an overview of tools/scripts/processes to triage and eventually understand the problem to a level where the next step would be to fix it.
We will go through heap dumps, thread dumps, process crash logs etc</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we'll be taking a session on debugging JVM performance issues. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide, at least not yet. What it does not cover are detailed instructions on how to use those tools. We would appreciate questions, feedback, or any other comments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                JVM stands for Java virtual machine. It's a lightweight virtual machine that runs Java applications. Its memory is divided into five sections. The garbage collector is a tool that collects and use Java objects. There are three ways in which the garbage collector can do it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Zero garbage collector creates a stopped wordpause when marking and collecting. Another implementation of the garbage collector is a concurrent mark and sweep. This is a multi thread concurrent marking and sweeping GC. In this next implementation it will prevent memory fermentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're going to look at some performance issues that we think are very common. When there's a thread that consists more cpu compared to other threads in the same application. One way to debug this scenario is by using jstack. Another way is by facing the Java fly recorder and mission control.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The second scenarios that we're going to look into is whether is a high gc activity or a high garbage collection activity. We want to see the difference between the minor GC versus the major GC. Now I will give the presentation back to Vania so he can spray to the next scenarios.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A high memory usage in a Java application can lead to an out of memory error. There are several ways to go about trialing this one such way is to use a tool called JMAP. Using a heap dump generation through any means should be done with a bit of caution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using the flight recorder and mission control, we can take a look at how memory usage threads usage and so and so all the instrumentation data for that application in that duration. A word of caution again, generating the heap dump halts the availability of the application so it should be used with caution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another aspect of information that we can get using Jwyder is basically the memory usage trend. We can see how the committed used and the maximum memory values have fluctuated over time. This is also useful in observing what kind of fluctuations are happening.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Whenever a java application crashes, it generates gist of the crash. A gist of a crash would look like this. It contains four key things. The reason for the crash, followed by the Java version that the application was running in when it crashed. And last but not least, where the crash log or the error report can be found.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There three primary symptoms, a high memory usage or a high cpu usage, or an application crash. The steps to triage that would be to first look at the XMX for the maximum allocatable heap size. Then look at those parts of the code that are key contributors to the memory usage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                High garbage collection activity often manifests itself as one of two symptoms, either a high memory usage or a high cpu usage. The third and final symptom is an application crash. This is accompanied by a gist of the crash, a core dump, and or a crash log.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                JVide is an open source library that lets us get all the information or metrics or diagnostic information we need. The third milestone which we'll be embarking on is fine tuning the JVM and looking into actually fixing the performance issues. After this, we also want to investigate other reasons for the application crash.
