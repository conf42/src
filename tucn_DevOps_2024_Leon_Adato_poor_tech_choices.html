                In 1984, case Western Reserve University, IBM, and at and T wanted to build the world's first free online community. Freenet was basically a glorified message board. Without those hours I spent on freenet, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to move up.

                Borland got his start in tech as a classroom instructor teaching adults how to use things like Wordstar Lotus. When he was out of work, he learned HTML and started building websites for people on the side. His leap into the world of monitoring started with a tool called Tivoli.

                The sheer number of choices and possible negative outcomes can be paralyzing. Do not try to hide your mistakes. It's always worth working with what you have now compared with waiting for the next thing.
