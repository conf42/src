    <meta property="og:description" content="For a couple of years, I taught beginner programming to high school and university students who did not intend to be developers. The members of these classes did not have an engineering background and only applied for fun â€” or because the curriculum forced them to. During these times I went through multiple iterations of my course materials and changed many of its details including the language being taught, the editor being used, and the storage of the resulting programs. I kept the parts that worked well in the previous semester and threw out the ones that did not. I had some very positive feedback along the way, along with some total failures. In this talk, I am sharing my learnings from these classes and invite the audience to help me improve the material even further with their feedback."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>For a couple of years, I taught beginner programming to high school and university students who did not intend to be developers. The members of these classes did not have an engineering background and only applied for fun â€” or because the curriculum forced them to.
During these times I went through multiple iterations of my course materials and changed many of its details including the language being taught, the editor being used, and the storage of the resulting programs. I kept the parts that worked well in the previous semester and threw out the ones that did not. I had some very positive feedback along the way, along with some total failures.
In this talk, I am sharing my learnings from these classes and invite the audience to help me improve the material even further with their feedback.</p>

In the fall of 2016, I had the interesting challenge of teaching beginner programming to a class of university students. My basic goal was to give them a sneak peek into the world of coding and an experience and feeling of success.

                The course was designed to teach programming to hungarian students. It was based on a port of processing which was written in Java and p five js written in JavaScript. Javascript is much more concise and expressive than Java. Curly found that understanding variable scope was a big hurdle.
