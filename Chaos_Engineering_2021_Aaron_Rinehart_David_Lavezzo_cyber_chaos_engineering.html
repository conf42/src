    <meta property="og:description" content="The complex ordeal of delivering secure and reliable software will continue to become exponentially more difficult unless we begin approaching the craft differently.  Enter Chaos Engineering, but now also for security. Instead of a focus on resilience against service disruptions, the focus is to identify the truth behind our current state security and determine what “normal” operations actually look like when it's put to the test.  The speed, scale, and complex operations within modern systems make them tremendously difficult for humans to mentally model their behavior. Security Chaos Engineering is an emerging practice that is helping engineers and security professionals realign the actual state of operational security and build confidence that it works the way it was intended to."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>The complex ordeal of delivering secure and reliable software will continue to become exponentially more difficult unless we begin approaching the craft differently.</p>
<p>Enter Chaos Engineering, but now also for security. Instead of a focus on resilience against service disruptions, the focus is to identify the truth behind our current state security and determine what “normal” operations actually look like when it&rsquo;s put to the test.</p>
<p>The speed, scale, and complex operations within modern systems make them tremendously difficult for humans to mentally model their behavior. Security Chaos Engineering is an emerging practice that is helping engineers and security professionals realign the actual state of operational security and build confidence that it works the way it was intended to.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we're going to talk about cyber chaos engineering and security chaos engineering. Aaron Reinhardt, CTO and co founder of Verica. David Lavezzo, director director of Cyber Chaos Engineers, Capital one. We'll talk about how it applies to cybersecurity.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In cybersecurity, the problem is becoming more and more frequent in terms of breaches and outages. The problem is the complexities and the scale of these systems is very difficult to keep track of in our heads. The answer to the complexity problem would be to simplify.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The normal function of your systems is to fail. It's humans to keep them from failure. We need to be more proactive in identifying when things aren't working the way we intend them to work. Chaos engineering was a key component of Netflix's cloud transformation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 chaos engineering is about testing versus experimentation. What we're trying to do is understand our systems and its security gaps before an adversary does. Security is no different from chaos engineering. It's about continuously verifying that security works the way we think it does.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem with instant response is response is actually the problem. Security incidents, by nature, are somewhat subjective. With security chaos engineering, we're actually introducing that x condition. We're doing this proactively, and we can now understand and measure and manage things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When I was at UnitedHealth group, we started experimenting with Netflix's chaos engineering. We applied it to some security use cases around instant response, security control validation. With all these promising vendors, it's even more difficult to make good decisions on what the correct action is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As you tune your environment, you have a baseline to reference when detection or alerting failed. How are people and teams being rewarded? Uptime and visibility. Once you succeed at this, you're going to be really popular.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Always be running the attacks. You'll know what's working and what is not working. With the typical alerts become the negatives. Testing removes guessing, and when you remove that guessing, you're removing mistakes. It's helping to train the new people they're going through.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Gap hunting leads to discovering gaps in understanding like what was missed. Can we go from detection only to prevention, too? Measurement is going to help. Audits become a lot easier when metrics are constantly being generated.

              </li>
              
              <li>
