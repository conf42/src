<p>In our quest to secure all the things, do we jump in too quickly? We&rsquo;ll use Istio and Linkerd as example service meshes, and look at the features we would expect from a service mesh. You&rsquo;ll leave with a concrete understanding of the service mesh, and be ready to justify the investment.</p>

                We're going to talk about service mesh to service meshes. Do you need a service mesh? How do you get started? We'll see demos of both Linkerd and istio in this process. I am definitely going to post the slides on my site tonight.

                AZ givecamp brings volunteer developers together with charities to build free software. Sunday afternoon we deliver completed software to the charities. If you're in Phoenix, come join us to the next AZ give camp. Or if you'd like a give camp closer to you, hit me up.

                Service mesh allows cars to communicate with each other, prioritize the traffic. What is a service mesh? Why would I use it? How do I get started? What are the benefits of it? And finally, we'll talk about best practices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A service mesh manages traffic between services in a graceful and scalable way. It can be used to observe, control, and secure the communication between microservices. By default, within Kubernetes, all of our services communicate over HTTP unencrypted.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A service mesh can secure both north south and east west traffic flowing into or out of our cluster. All the traffic can communicate between the service and its proxy just across localhost. Service meshes can observe, control and secure the traffic going through the cluster.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                First up, Linkerd. Linkerd focuses on having everything that you need to get started in the box. Next up, istio's methodology is very different. It tries to include the best of open source projects. Now we'll dig in deep with Istio's virtual services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Linkerd focuses on a really elegant and smooth install experience. The install experience is super fast and allows us to get going really easily. Let's take a look at the dashboard inside Linkerd.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next, let's take a look at istio's virtual routing. We have three different review services. It has this virtual service that routes traffic evenly between them. Let's see an upgrade cycle of how we might use Istio to route traffic without downtime.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Yeager is really great for open telemetry. Kiali is great for visualizing who calls what. Service mesh is a really elegant tool. Is it worth the investment to have that level of observability and security?
