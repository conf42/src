            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Gordon Rudd will talk to you about information security and specifically how to be a chief information security officer. Please feel free to connect with me on any social media platform. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are going to talk about every CISO's 1st 90 days and how to achieve lasting success as a CISO. If you're going to have a great career, you've got to monitor these nine things all the time. Also talk about finding your company's rhythm, about due diligence, collaboration and automating.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Take a moment and decide what kind of CISo are you. Are you a technical or a managerial CISO? That's a hands on versus an executive. I strongly suggest that you find either a coach or an accountability partner.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As a CISo, you should have a 30, 60, 90 day plan in your possession. You want to assess the enterprise's cybersecurity, their architecture and their current training plan. Prep, measure, assess, plan, mapping everything out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As we come up through our network with our itoperations, systems, applications, the whole thing, 123456 serves. Every time you build in scalability, you're building in economic flexibility. One size doesn't fit all. The differences in infrastructure and information security will change.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Go is becoming part of information security professional's arsenal. Python has been the biggest thing in the world for security forensics. Log aggregation, log management, very critical. Firewall clustering, AI user behavior analytics are critical for you.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The board is 100% responsible for the organization. You want to report to them every month, every time they meet. Cybersecurity board reports should include a total inventory of everything you're managing. If you don't communicate they're going to speculate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make sure you're assessing risks. You need to have an understanding of the people, processes and technology that are going on within your organization. Every line of business is an attack surface. The quantitative management capability is really the Golden Circle.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Stop looking for the unicorn employee. Build your own unicorns and do it using a model like this. Get a training plan in place to bring your team up to where they need to be. Make sure that your people and the IT people have certifications.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You're going to be doing risk assessments at least annually or as needed. Scan small network segments daily, but make it a different segment. Have continuity management in place so everything can be restored. Watch your numbers, watch your budget numbers, your employees.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Five areas where successful cisos excel. High performance team building. Third party risk management. Measure, assess, plan, map. The information security department, the people in it, and the organization it serves.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                My big tell on operational readiness is showing me your sock. Network operating centers and security operating systems do have overlap. Make sure that you have critical infrastructure designations in your mind. Plans have to have a timeline on them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Risk analysis is really simple. You should have a risk appetite statement. Be willing to invest in your team, get them certifications. You need to be aware of change management and how change management differs from the Internet of things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The CISO has released its best practices to save you from being disrupted by ransomware. Filtering network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known malicious ip addresses. Backups should be tested every day. Make sure that you're doing everything you can to stay secure.
              </li>
