    <meta property="og:description" content="In the past, my team was responsible for specific applications/ executables. Now, we are responsible for specific for end-user workflows, no matter which executables they involve. I will describe the technical and social changes that necessitated and enabled this change of paradigm. At the end of 2019, our team supported in the order of 200 executables/microservices that provide functionality for Google's products in the advertising space.  This number was the result of continuous growth over more than 10 years."/>

<p>In the past, my team was responsible for specific applications/ executables. Now, we are responsible for specific for end-user workflows, no matter which executables they involve. I will describe the technical and social changes that necessitated and enabled this change of paradigm. At the end of 2019, our team supported in the order of 200 executables/microservices that provide functionality for Google&rsquo;s products in the advertising space.</p>
<p>This number was the result of continuous growth over more than 10 years.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 Nikolaus Rath is a tech lead for one of the SRE teams in Google's London office. He will talk about the transition from a service ownership to product ownership. His presentation will have three main parts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                My team, we are 40 people in total, distributed across two locations, one in London and one at the US west coast to cover pager around the clock. At any given point in time we have at least two people on call. The reason for that is simply the number of services that we have.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Google spends about 30% of its time on interrupt work and 20% on service maintenance. The vast majority of our time, about 50%, is really spent on project work. This is not addressing an urgent need that threatened the reliability of our products. The goal is to spend our time more efficiently.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE support is something that is provided for specific services. Things change over time. The easiest way to make the product scale better for a higher number of users is to split it into smaller services. The degree of automation and uniformity that we have across all the things that we support is really quite impressive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE is no longer supporting these services, aka binaries, continuous executables. But SRE supports products. The overall product reliability is determined by the unsupported services. It gets really difficult to translate issues with a service into the resulting user experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have defined cuis for many of our projects. We also defined and wrote up what we call a production curriculum. Our services are now continuously monitored for compliance with all the best practices. We still need to extend CUI coverage to all our products. But the changes have been welcomed.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The real bottleneck for the products reliability is in the services that we currently don't support. We changed our engagement model and rescoping our support from individual services to products as a whole. We put developers in charge of running their services. Overall the changes have been a success.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This brings me to the end of my presentation. Normally I'd ask for questions. This being a recording, of course, makes that impossible. Still, if there is questions, you're welcome to send them by email. I hope this presentation was interesting and worth your time.
              </li>
