              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Miha Mikoyczak is chief architect and tech leader Datravit, a machine learning, data focused software house. This talk will explore the patterns, the trends that we are seeing when actually deploying the generative AI LLMs based application and where are the challenges where all of that is going.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 LLM is a machine learning model, but it's trained on very large amounts of data. It can be either fine tuned or adapted with just prompt. All machine learning models are susceptible to errors. The thing is, are they useful for our product or business?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Norway employs generative AI to help in companies across varying industries. Uses include software development support, content generation and information extraction. The applications are really broad and it's visible also in the business runs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The projection is that the generative AI revenue and the spend of that will be raising and raising in the incoming years. Most of the real business value comes in from connecting the company data, the private data. There are two major options: commercial solutions or experimentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For a simple chatbot, it cost almost three, $3,000, right? Trend is that those models are fortunately they're getting more and more cost effective. Still, if we are sending it to somebody like we did in our case study, there is a concern.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                40% of hackers think that Genai will lead to increase in vulnerabilities. More than half of them say that generative AI tools will become a major targets that they will be targeting in the incoming years. Another concern is data safety.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One business wants to use AI for everything. They are quite costly in terms of the compute and cost. There are some privacy and legal restrictions, security and safety. Companies are lacking this AI related competencies and technical expertise. Models will become more and more capable and cost efficient.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The content windows of alarms are increasing. Trend is that those models are getting more and bigger and bigger context windows. The more content we are putting, the more cost increases. But still it depends on the use case.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                More providers are starting to provide features related to data privacy. Large language models are actually going beyond text modality. Many of the models are capable of interacting with modalities beyond the text. European Union is at the forefront of regulating artificial intelligence.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are some problems with privacy, ethical concerns about the generative AI. But on the other hand, those models are becoming more and more capable, cheaper. In the future, the future is looking for generativeAI is looking bright, right.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Well, if you have any questions right around the things that we asked that I was talking about, feel free to connect to me. I would be happy to hear your predictions about what might be happening. As mentioned, excited and looking and looking forward to future.
