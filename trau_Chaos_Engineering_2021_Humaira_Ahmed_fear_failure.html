    <meta property="og:description" content="The fear of failure and rejection holds so many of us back from achieving our ambitions in life. Especially for women, the fear of failure and rejection becomes ever more so prevalent as we struggle not only against our personal insecurities but also against the pressure put onto us by society.   Humaira Ahmed shares her remarkable background in overcoming barriers in the tech industry. Growing up in Pakistan, Humaira is familiar with the struggles she, and many other women, faced in achieving success in choosing to pursue a career in the tech industry, which remains to be very much male-dominated. Humaira excelled in mathematics and was able to secure a position in studying abroad at York University, where she specialized in marketing and communications, and dedicated her passion and experience in starting Locelle to motivate, inspire and empower other women to pursue their ambitions in tech.   Humairaâ€™s unique experience from growing up in Pakistan to becoming the Founder and CEO of Locelle has taught her three core values to succeed and be empowered in working as a woman in the tech industry.  Top three themes to be covered in this presentation include:  > Fear of Failure/Rejection >> The Power of Mentorship >>> Bootstrapping My Tech Startup "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>The fear of failure and rejection holds so many of us back from achieving our ambitions in life. Especially for women, the fear of failure and rejection becomes ever more so prevalent as we struggle not only against our personal insecurities but also against the pressure put onto us by society.</p>
<p>Humaira Ahmed shares her remarkable background in overcoming barriers in the tech industry. Growing up in Pakistan, Humaira is familiar with the struggles she, and many other women, faced in achieving success in choosing to pursue a career in the tech industry, which remains to be very much male-dominated. Humaira excelled in mathematics and was able to secure a position in studying abroad at York University, where she specialized in marketing and communications, and dedicated her passion and experience in starting Locelle to motivate, inspire and empower other women to pursue their ambitions in tech. </p>
<p>Humairaâ€™s unique experience from growing up in Pakistan to becoming the Founder and CEO of Locelle has taught her three core values to succeed and be empowered in working as a woman in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Top three themes to be covered in this presentation include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear of Failure/Rejection</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Power of Mentorship</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bootstrapping My Tech Startup</p>
</blockquote>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Humaira Ahmed is the founder and CEO of locale which is a mentorship platform created for women in the workplace. We focus on one to one matching with industry leaders for mentorship as well as guidance on the go.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In Pakistan, engagements are as serious as marriages. The fear of regret drives us forward, unlike the fear of failure that holds us back. I'll share three of my life stories to give you more insight and to help you understand the difference.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Shemera got into one of the best schools for software engineering in Pakistan. But her parents didn't want her to go to school for three reasons: She'll lose her complexion, have affairs and not work after marriage. Her parents recommended three things she should do to improve her looks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Only 5% of ceos in tech are women. Over 90% of the tech startups fail in the first year. Locelle is on a mission to create equitable workplaces for women. "I challenge status quo every single day"

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So with all these three stories, I want to share. the common three lessons. One, challenge the status quo. Two, persevere. Persevere with all your might for the right things in your life. And the last lesson that I can share with you today is to commit to yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And today, I also want you to think of something you really, really want for yourself. Write it down and focus on it. Something you'll regret in life if you don't go for your dreams. Do not let the fear of failure stop you from shaping your life.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
