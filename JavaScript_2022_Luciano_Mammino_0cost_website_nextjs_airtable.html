    <meta property="og:description" content="Imagine you are hosting a private event and you want to create a website to invite all your guests. Of course, you'd like to have an easy way to just share a URL with every guest and they should be able to access all the details of the event. Everyone else should not be allowed to see the page. Even nicer if the website is customized for every guest and if you could use the same website to collect information from the guests (who is coming and who is not). Ok, how do we build all of this? But, most importantly, how do we build it quickly? How do we keep it simple and possibly host it 100% for FREE? I had to do something like this recently so, in this talk, I am going to share my solution, which involves a React SPA (built with Next.js & Vercel) and AirTable as a backend! In the process, we are going to learn some tricks, like how to build a custom React Hook and how to protect our app from AirTable query injection (yes, it's a thing)!"/>

<p>Imagine you are hosting a private event and you want to create a website to invite all your guests. Of course, you&rsquo;d like to have an easy way to just share a URL with every guest and they should be able to access all the details of the event. Everyone else should not be allowed to see the page. Even nicer if the website is customized for every guest and if you could use the same website to collect information from the guests (who is coming and who is not). Ok, how do we build all of this? But, most importantly, how do we build it quickly? How do we keep it simple and possibly host it 100% for FREE? I had to do something like this recently so, in this talk, I am going to share my solution, which involves a React SPA (built with Next.js &amp; Vercel) and AirTable as a backend! In the process, we are going to learn some tricks, like how to build a custom React Hook and how to protect our app from AirTable query injection (yes, it&rsquo;s a thing)!</p>

              <li>
                Jamaica make a real time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems. observing changes exceptions errors in real time allows youd to not only experiment with confidence, but respond instantly to get things working again. Let's build at zero cost inviteonly website with nextjs and airtable. The slides are already available online.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Software engineers want to build an inviteonly website. The idea is to have a database of people that we want to invite to an event. We need a solution that is simple to host, very simple to maintain and update. We also need a lightweight back end.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Duchano is a Microsoft MVP and a certified AWS solution architect professional. He is one of the co authors of this book called Node JS Design Patterns. Fourtheorem is a service company focused on cloud and AWS. We are always hiring, we are always looking for new, interesting projects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are going to be using airtable as a database for a web application. We will also be looking into nextjs and versailles, which are other components that we will be using in our architecture. Finally, we will discuss some interesting security considerations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nextjs, airtable and Purcell. Also we are coming to be using GitHub as a hosting for all the source code. With this tech stack, we should be able to host an application that doesn't have a huge amount of traffic pretty much for free.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                NextJs allows you to make an XJS website private. Only people with a valid invite code can access the information that we want to disclose. Using nextjs you can easily build a react single page application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Airtable can be used to build an app inside nextjs. To use airtable in our backend, we need to have API keys and base id. Next step is to create an invite type which contains more or less the same fields that we had in airtable. This allows us to interact with airtable and fetch data from that data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A custom react hook is just a javascript function that had the name starting with the word use. The idea is that youd can only call hooks at the top level of the function. Hooks cannot be inside loops, condition or other nested functions. You can find more details and examples in the official documentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to allow the user the opportunity to submit data to our back end. We need to add new backend utilities in our airtable helper to be able to update our table. And another function that can be used by the front end to trigger the update.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use GitHub and Vercel to create an XJs application. Hook manages all the lifecycle of this data. Allows us to show a spinner while a request is in progress. How do we deploy all of this?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of the information that we have in our website is effectively going to be compiled inside the client side javascript that then eventually is made available by the browser. Even if a user doesn't have an invite code, they can actually look into that and extrapolate some sensitive information. How can we avoid that?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Airtable is a case study for a quick and easy and cheap solution that you can use if you need to build an invite only website. The takeaway here is just take some of the lessons and then try to apply them to your code base. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me.
