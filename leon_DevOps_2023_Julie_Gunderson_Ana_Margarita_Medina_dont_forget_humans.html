    <meta property="og:description" content="Humans are essential to the development and reliability of our technical systems, but we often forget them. This talk will share the benefits of prioritizing human systems and how to get there. We spend all day thinking about our technical systems, but we often neglect the needs of our human systems. Ana and Julie will walk attendees through the principles of system reliability and how to not only apply them to their systems but their personal life to prevent burnout and enjoy their weekends more. In this talk, attendees will learn how to apply incident response and blameless practices into their everyday activities. Attendees will also walk away knowing how to build reliable socio-technical systems and some tips to apply them to the workplace."/>

<p>Humans are essential to the development and reliability of our technical systems, but we often forget them. This talk will share the benefits of prioritizing human systems and how to get there.
We spend all day thinking about our technical systems, but we often neglect the needs of our human systems. Ana and Julie will walk attendees through the principles of system reliability and how to not only apply them to their systems but their personal life to prevent burnout and enjoy their weekends more.
In this talk, attendees will learn how to apply incident response and blameless practices into their everyday activities. Attendees will also walk away knowing how to build reliable socio-technical systems and some tips to apply them to the workplace.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Julie Gunderson is senior developer advocate at AWS. Ana Margarita Medina is a staff, staff developer advocate, lightstep. Why dont we tell you who we are so you don't forget us.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The increased reliance on technology in various industries and in everyday life has increased this push for reliability in our systems. Technology plays a larger role in critical infrastructure and healthcare and finance, transportation and all other areas. One failure is very likely to cause more cascading effects. The reliability of these systems is crucial to minimizing impact.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS wants to automatically recover from failure by monitoring a workload for key performance indicators. With more sophisticated automation, it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur. Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The AWS well architected framework gives us a good overview of what we need to aspire for in order to be reliable. But we also remember that humans are very complex. Our human systems are very similar to our technical systems. How we handle failures can make a huge impact.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An incident is an unplanned disruption of service. But even though it's unplanned, we still prepare for incidents. Incident response has multiple phases. There is the preparation. That's a great way to practice your incident response.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we talk about incident response in humans, well, just like incidents, life happens. The goal of incident response is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. This is exactly what we want to apply to our personal lives as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Two in five tech workers are showing a high risk of burnout due to a lot of stress, being exhausted due to their hours. Burnout is not depression, but it can definitely lead you there. How can we be more in tune with our systems to prevent these incidents from happening?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it comes to humans, you got to do capacity planning. Humans have a maximum capacity. People have to be in tune with their limit. Other things that you can really do is focus on a blameless culture. Practice blamelessness.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Anna: What are some things that we could be doing today that allow us to live a life worth living? Live a life with your loved one. Set up some goals, set up some north stars of where you want your life to be. Another way that we can continue to be proactive is to plan for the future.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Make sure to check in with yourself often, whatever often means for you. Check in on your teammates and loved ones just to make sure that they're also hanging in there. Do something nice for yourself every once in a while. All images in this presentation were created by humans.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And then to kind of finish up Anna's story, I was the person that she lost in the ocean. I did end up about a quarter of a mile away, and it was a fun walk back. Ultimately, I'm alive, did not get eaten by a shark.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
