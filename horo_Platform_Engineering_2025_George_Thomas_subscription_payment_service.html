can build like a self-service by default, right?", "timestamp": "00:04:27,475", "timestamp_s": 267.0}, {"text": "So that like engineering teams are not involved in each product", "timestamp": "00:04:31,615", "timestamp_s": 271.0}, {"text": "launches or pricing changes or payment method launches, right?", "timestamp": "00:04:34,235", "timestamp_s": 274.0}, {"text": "So it\u0027s more like configuration based that any product team can do.", "timestamp": "00:04:37,985", "timestamp_s": 277.0}, {"text": "So third is like confluence, right?", "timestamp": "00:04:41,675", "timestamp_s":
