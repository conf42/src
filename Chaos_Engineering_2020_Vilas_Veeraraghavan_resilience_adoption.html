    <meta property="og:description" content="Chaos engineering has come a long way from its early days at Netflix. Its importance is no longer questioned in the community but as it has gone mainstream, teams quickly learn that adoption is not a given.   In this talk, we talk about the challenges that we encountered at Walmart and the techniques used to break through them."/>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                I'm Vilas. I am a director of engineering at Walmart. I focus on enabling developers to deploy their code in a resilient, performant way into the cloud of their choice. To execute something like this at Walmart scale was going to be a huge challenge.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every outage was essentially a chaos exercise that was completely unintentional. We wanted to calculate a per incident cost. We want to plan better a culture of software resilience. The teams that were running this had to do some homework.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The homework that is needed is very generic. First is observability. For every critical dependency failure, there needs to be a detailed playbook or an automated way to have fallbacks instituted. Testing a playbook continuously is the answer.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other thing I would say needs investment is a CI CD workflow, right? The diagram that I have on the screen essentially demonstrates what a real CI CD pipeline looks like. Investing in tools is important because I believe the ecosystem is still sort of getting up to speed on that killer product.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The last thing is carrots, not sticks, which teams, you treat them with rewards, not punishments. The exercises cannot be conducted without complete participation. Resiliency is crucial. Every team does not see it the same way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The report card reads really good. The application teams are eager to run these tests. Management confidence is good because management invests in this. The goal is resiliency, but the way to get to that is chaos. Going forward, what we want to do is build on these models.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
