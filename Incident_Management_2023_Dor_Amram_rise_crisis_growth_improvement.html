                Growth culture is the foundation of every going organization. Focus on learning means that you want to make sure every day that tomorrow you'll be a bit better than you were today. If your company does not have a guild, start one today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                System design, or let's say system documentation. Have you ever stopped and read that it's documentation? This could be a great way to see, to look for the next storm.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Design reviews is a way for you to tell people what you plan to do before you do it. You address an issue, you find a solution, and before you start to implement it, you present it to your team, to your manager, to everyone relevant to this issue. Do that before you implement, not after, because then it gets incredibly harder.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Tests are your best way to connect with the mind of the person who wrote the code you're dealing with. Read the test, not just pass them. And finally schedule a time for it. A few hours every week that you invest in these areas, it will get you better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The second point is continuous communication. Open communication means that you feel free to tell people what you think. The second thing is clear goals. You don't want to hide the bad stuff. You want to be as transparent as possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The final thing in this subject is regular check ins. Talk with the people in your team and ask them how are they. You'll be surprised with some of the answers you may hear. Make sure you do this on a regular basis and not just once a year.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point I want to talk about is supportive environment. You want to encourage collaboration. The next thing is to forego blame. In order to improve your product, you need to learn from these mistakes and not looking for the person who didn't.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point I want to address is experimentation, or space for experimentation. Just because you have something that works does not mean it cannot work better. The best way to find out is to be creative.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point I want to address is the resources and time again, like in the last point, you want to provide your researchers, your team, the means to do so. Give people the tools they need in order for them to provide with a full solution. The last thing Iwant to talk about is the culture of the teams and the continuous improvement of it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point I want to talk about is empowering champions. How often do you talk about the good things, the achievements, the progress, the people who made them? First of all, celebrate victories. You want to share success stories. It will inspire the people in your organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next point I want to talk about is task pitching. What if your employees could pitch some of the tasks to you? By giving your employees the opportunity to pitch their tasks, you're basically giving them a sense of responsibility. The ownership of this task is much higher.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next part I want to talk about is lead hackathons. You want to give your employees stronger sense of ownership. It could be any initiative someone in your team is trying to advance. We want to enable space for experimentation. Finally, we want to empower the champions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                First thing you want to do is to identify the incident. After that, activate your response team and have them start working on it. Make sure the incidents does not spread to a different part of the system. Throughout this entire process, communicate with the stakeholders.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If your postmortem does not have action items, you did not did a postmortem. You simply wasted an hour of your team. Instead of postmortem, let's do premortem. Let's handle the incidents before they're happening and not after.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Increase your resiliency. First of all, you can upgrade it. Do that before something happens, not after. Also invest in your transparency and discoverability. Share your knowledge. Make other people rise from your incidents.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So let's recap. You want to increase your resiliency. You don't want any tiny bug to disrupt your system entirely. When the winds of change blow, build walls while other build windmills. Use it as your tool. Look for it. Evolve from it.
              </li>
