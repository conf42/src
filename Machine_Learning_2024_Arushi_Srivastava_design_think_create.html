              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Welcome to this talk on design thinking before you develop your next AI product. In today's talk, we will dive deeper into the current state of AI. What are some of the issues that haunt AI application in the absence of approaches like design thinking? And then how can design thinking really help?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AI is to be a force multiplier for people and organizations taking over repetitive tasks. Biggest promise of AI is to ensure that the technology supporting our society keeps updating itself continuously with the changes that come with time. Over 80% of businesses expected to adopt AI by 2025.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the most prominent area of challenges in the current state of AI still haunt us. Currently, the kind of energy requirements that large scale AI applications are simply not sustainable and feasible for most of the businesses and people. The biggest thing, which is closely related to adoption and scaling, is the trust.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Bias is a big issue which is haunting AI right now. The second one is accuracy and real time intelligence. Third one is about explainability the AI system, the kind of recommendation it has given you. communicating them to the end customers are extremely important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next one is about the security, copyright and IP infringement. The last one is hallucinations. Users are not able to trust AI completely. The root cause is lack of explainability. Some of the problems that we are seeing right now will not exist in 2040.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Design thinking always keeps it's focused on user at the center of it. Everything that you design is for a specific Persona. There is also a focus on iterative development which can really help you to solve problems incrementally. There are definitely these application adoption and trust issues that could benefit from the approach of design thinking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Design thinking is an approach to solving bigger problems by understanding users needs and developing insights to solve those needs. When the problems are really wicked, then that means they are extremely complex. And when you have, you need to create a unique experience. When should you use design thinking or not?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Traditional design thinking approach has been there for some time. IBM's designed for AI framework is looking at design thinking from the AI's point of view. How you can train the traditional approach and apply some AI considerations on it so that your learning curve is not as deep.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next one is really about storytelling, journey mapping and Personas. You have to cross collaborate, not just with end user, but also with internal business team. Design thinking can greatly help AI solutions in maintaining their quality issues.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Coming to mode three idea in this mode, you basically try to get as much ideas for solution as possible. The next mode is prototype. Here, people create the physical form of the best ideas, the prioritized ideas, and then they allow people to experience and interact with them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Again, thank you so much for your time today. Let me know if you have any questions. You can always shoot me a note at arushi dot shivastava mail. com. I would like to consider diverse data sets in my thinking as well.
