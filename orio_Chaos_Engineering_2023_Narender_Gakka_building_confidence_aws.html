              <li>
                In this session, we'll discuss about building confidence through chaos engineering on AWS. We'll learn what chaos engineering is and what it isn't and what value is of chaos engineering. And how can we get started with chaos engineering within your own firms?

              <li>
                Narender Gakka is a solutions architect at AWS. He will talk about chaos engineering and continuous resilience. Chaos engineering is not just about blowing up production. It's more like improved operational readiness. And when all of this put together, it leads to a better application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In a distributed system, there is no way that every single person understands the hundreds or many microservices that we communicate with each other. You need mechanisms which come into play, and those mechanisms can be built using chaos engineering and continuous resilience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are many companies that have already adopted chaos engineering. Gartner says 40% of companies will adopt chaos engineering in next year alone. These are some of the industries what we see on the screen. There are many case studies or customer stories.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So let's get the prerequisites on how you can get started with chaos engineering. First you need like basic monitoring, and if you already have observability already. You need to have organizational awareness as well. And then fourth is then, of course, once we find those faults within the environment, we find a deficiency.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In chaos engineering, we call metrics as known unknowns. By collating all the information, we start looking at like highest level at our baseline instead of looking at a particular graph. Observability is based on three key pillars: metrics, logging and tracing. Small teams can be injected into chaos engineering to decentralize development.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Real world failures and faults which this application can suffer or have dependency on. These are some of the real world experiments which you can do with the chaos engineering. And then the last prerequisite is about making sure that when we are building a deficiency within our systems that could be related to security or resilience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Continuous resilience is a lifecycle that helps us think about workload from a steady state point of view. Chaos Engineering and continuous Resilience program builds safe experimentation of these within our pipelines. With chaos engineering, it's important to truly plan what we want to execute.

              <li>
                The well architected review helps customers build secure, high performing, resilient and efficient workloads on AWS. It has six pillars like operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, efficiency and cost optimization. The next phase is basically defining experiment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we think about an experiment to simulate a brownout within our eks environments, we need to understand the steady state. The hypothesis is key as well when we are thinking about the experiment, because the hypothesis will define at the end. The execution flow is like.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Running a chaos engineering experiment requires great tools that are safe to experiment. In AWS, we have fault injection simulator with which you can inject faults. Also integration with litmus chaos and the chaos mesh. If something goes wrong during that experiment, it should basically stop and then roll back the whole experiment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Now let's move to the next environment, which is obviously taking this into the production. You have to think about the guardrails that are important in your production environment. We want to basically take this learnings and automate that so that we can bring them and run them in pipelines.
