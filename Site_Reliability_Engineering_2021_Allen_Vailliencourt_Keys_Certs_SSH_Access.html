    <meta property="og:description" content="Today's software developers, DevOps teams, SRE's, and SysAdmins are familiar with the concept of public-key cryptography for gaining access to remote resources but using public and private keys has its limitations and can be difficult to scale and manage. Consider leveraging short-term certificates for SSH access over keys and rest easy!   This talk will go over the pros and cons of using keys vs certificates and how to get started using short-term certificates!"/>

<p>Today&rsquo;s software developers, DevOps teams, SRE&rsquo;s, and SysAdmins are familiar with the concept of public-key cryptography for gaining access to remote resources but using public and private keys has its limitations and can be difficult to scale and manage.

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native. Today we're going to talk about keys or certificates for SSH access. This is how we've been accessing resources for years, and it's still very popular.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For years we've been using PKA for accessing resources. It's not overly difficult to find a system that does not support public key authentication today. Why change from keys to certificates for authentication? If the system isn't broke, why change it up?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What happens when your user moves on to a new role? What about when a device is potentially compromised or stolen? Laptops. With all of us working remotely, working distributed laptops are powerful enough. 15,000 keys that are now out there that you're having to manage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Someone accidentally commits a private key to their public repo. Within minutes this can be utilized to log into a service and cause chaos. The responsibility sits on you as an SRE to handle this and manage this. Scaling out deployments can be a wee bit challenging.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open SSH, which is pretty much the de facto standard for SSH certificates or SSH period, had support, added support back in version 5.4. Companies today already using certificate authentication, Netflix, open source, the bless protocol, they're open source using certificates. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but it does pay off in the long run.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 certificates require a certificate authority to own the public private key pairs to generate those certificates. If a certificate is tampered with, it breaks that signature and invalidates that certificate. certificates can be set to expire. You can actually set a certificate to be like two weeks old.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 demo shows how to use SSH certificates without using standard username passwords or a public private key. This is a demo repo, this is not something you want to run in production. It's designed to help you understand how SSH certificates work in a little bit more detail.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                On top of that, we are hiring. If you're interested in working for a series B funded, fast growing startup, love to have you apply with the link there. 100 employees, we're fully distributed working on open source. Anyways, that's all I've got today.
