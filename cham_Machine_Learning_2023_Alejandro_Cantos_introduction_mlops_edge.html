<p>With the exponential development in hardware processing capacity and the commoditization of AI models, the edge has emerged as an alternative to the cloud for secure and private real-time AI deployment. Thus, the efficient and automated control of models requires new specialized working methods.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Alex from edge computing company Barbara says the cloud is broken. Says it's too dependent on the Internet and has latency and cost problems. Also has issues with privacy and compliance. Says there are eight reasons why the cloud might be broken.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So edge is the new cloud. The ability to create results through AI and edge computing is the most significant value refactoring since cloud computing. There are four main drivers of edge computing: low latency, lower bandwidth consumption, privacy and security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 edge computing is a powerful technology, but when it couples with AI, then it just becomes a massive commoditization, a massive team. Why does it make sense to deploy this in the edge? Because they have many water treatment plants globally. Other drivers make the cloud not the best choice.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In energy we have loads of edge computing applications. EDP wanted to give their customers at home a system that would allow them to make an intelligent use of the energy. What if all the homes could speak to each other and somehow get in touch and exchange all the energy that they don't need anymore?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Alexa is a smart speaker that many of us have at home. The idea with Alexa is that there is some edge computing in play, but there's also some cloud computing. This is a good example on how we will see edge computing complement cloud Computing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are many applications that make sense at some point between the cloud and the edge. Many applications need to distribute their workloads in this edge to cloud continuum. If we combine these three guys, edge plus cloud plus AI, we have a very powerful team that's capable of almost anything.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We should be deploying many models in different places from the edge to the cloud. How do we manage this complexity? Well, mlops comes to the rescue. It's about maintaining machine learning models in production. One of the biggest mlops challenges is usually deploying and also monitoring.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Some traditional players, such as Google, are shutting down their IoT edge computing offering. There are different breed of companies in comparison to the big cloud providers, but they're also small. And today I'm going to speak about Barbara because that's the company I work in. I believe it's going to become the new standard.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea here is that you could have as many devices as you wanted. You could operate them individually or group them by groups. Sending workloads, machine learning algorithms or anything to your edge devices is very easy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Point number five is about applications. There you have a section devoted to many different use cases. You're going to see why it makes sense in these spaces to use edge computing. If you want to know more about what Apple applications make sense in the edge, just go to our website.
