    <meta property="og:description" content="So your company has finally decided to move to the Cloud Native ecosystem. You’ve landed on containerization as your first step. You heard that all you needed to do was containerize your first app and then push it to Kubernetes/OpenShift/Nomad, and the cost savings just come. You’ve done this, and well, things have gone not as planned. Some of the tech didn’t do what you expected, and wait, what do you mean our OpEx has gone up? Simply said: the promise of containerization or migrating to the Cloud Native ecosystem can be a lie if you don’t do your homework. Sadly most companies don’t. In this talk, I’ll explain a few gotchas that a “few” enterprises, in the guise of AsgharLabs, hit moving towards the Cloud Native world, and hopefully, you’ll learn from their mistakes, so you’re trip down this path will be more comfortable and closer to the promise.  Outline Introductions * What is AsgharLabs and where they started, what they thought they needed to do * Where I came into the conversation to help AsgharLabs * Questions you should ask after getting your app containerized * Where are the architectural advantages and disadvantages? * Are we doubling up on things? * Isn’t automation good here? Why is this thing so complicated now? * Questions you should ask about the cultural shift that will happen * How the economics of the Cloud can differ from your Datacenter * What do you mean our support is now Stack Overflow? * What do you mean our goal is to move away from the CCB? * Some tangible things you can start with to help become more successful * Build that pipeline extension * Collaborate with other teams * Visibility and Monitoring * Conclusion and where you can go from here"/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>So your company has finally decided to move to the Cloud Native ecosystem. You’ve landed on containerization as your first step. You heard that all you needed to do was containerize your first app and then push it to Kubernetes/OpenShift/Nomad, and the cost savings just come. You’ve done this, and well, things have gone not as planned. Some of the tech didn’t do what you expected, and wait, what do you mean our OpEx has gone up?
Simply said: the promise of containerization or migrating to the Cloud Native ecosystem can be a lie if you don’t do your homework. Sadly most companies don’t. In this talk, I’ll explain a few gotchas that a “few” enterprises, in the guise of AsgharLabs, hit moving towards the Cloud Native world, and hopefully, you’ll learn from their mistakes, so you’re trip down this path will be more comfortable and closer to the promise.</p>
<p>Outline
Introductions
* What is AsgharLabs and where they started, what they thought they needed to do
* Where I came into the conversation to help AsgharLabs
* Questions you should ask after getting your app containerized
* Where are the architectural advantages and disadvantages?
* Are we doubling up on things?
* Isn’t automation good here? Why is this thing so complicated now?
* Questions you should ask about the cultural shift that will happen
* How the economics of the Cloud can differ from your Datacenter
* What do you mean our support is now Stack Overflow?
* What do you mean our goal is to move away from the CCB?
* Some tangible things you can start with to help become more successful
* Build that pipeline extension
* Collaborate with other teams
* Visibility and Monitoring
* Conclusion and where you can go from here</p>

                The promise of containerization or migrating to the cloud native ecosystem can be a lie if you don't do your homework. In this talk, I'll explain a few gotchas that a few enterprises in the guise of a company called Asgar Labs hit. Hopefully you'll learn from their mistakes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 JJ Asgharlabs is just a multinational tech conglomerate with multiple subsidiaries. He asked some very simple but very tough questions to these companies. Spoiler alert: It's nowhere near what they thought they could provide.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Who containerized your app? Was it developers or the operations team? You need to know what made them decide to do the thing they did and who they are. Why did you containerize? If you dont actually need to, you shouldn't need to if you're making money.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Containerization is the promise of it is you should be able to take your app, wrap it up in a container and ship it anywhere. The next step is naturally repackaging to microservices. Is this cloud the best for your company? Or is this something just forced upon you?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Now we need to talk about refactoring into the strangler pattern. So as you take your different was files and you break them up, now you create them into little microservices. In turn, you'll be able to allow things to be rolled out quicker.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The goal is to move away from the change control board now. Your Kubernetes cluster can actually be scoped to what it needs to be. One pod isn't as good as multiple smaller pods. You're going to have to sit down and really refactor and architect your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need to lean towards more of the pipelines and collaborate to get the different widgets out and the different applications out at the right time. You'll need CI and CD pipelines. You also need to learn to collaborate with the other teams. It is unbelievably powerful when you start really, truly learning how to share, collaborate and move forward.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it came to visibility monitoring, Nagius wouldn't cut it anymore. There are too many moving parts in the cloud native ecosystem that you just don't have that visibility. As long as you can get that graph that goes up and to the right, that'll be some of the best monitoring.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do the economics of the cloud differ from your data center? You can't depreciate anything that is in the cloud. You're going to have to work with your CFO and your accounting teams to make sure you sit inside. There are some companies that want to leverage fully open source work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When moving to the cloud native ecosystem, be sure you're choosing the right tool, the right job. Look for optimizations instead of features. You pay up front, you'll be able to get dividends for that later on.

              </li>
