    <meta property="og:description" content="We, at Humana, Fortune 41 company, started our DevOps journey in 2018, when organizational change lead the way and we are excited to come back to provide an insightful update on our current DevOps journey and how our people are driving the change today, to keep the momentum going and serving our Humana Engineers, by providing the tools, platforms and streamlined processes so that they can continue to create delightful experiences for our Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and Pharmacy customers. We are working hard each day to challenge the routine and pioneer simplicity and build a data-driven mindset around change, letting people drive the change based on data. In our session, we will provide you with some key lessons learned around how growing people and their engineering practices actually creates the differentiator for a business and not the technology or platforms that an organization purchases."/>

<p>We, at Humana, Fortune 41 company, started our DevOps journey in 2018, when organizational change lead the way and we are excited to come back to provide an insightful update on our current DevOps journey and how our people are driving the change today, to keep the momentum going and serving our Humana Engineers, by providing the tools, platforms and streamlined processes so that they can continue to create delightful experiences for our Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and Pharmacy customers.
We are working hard each day to challenge the routine and pioneer simplicity and build a data-driven mindset around change, letting people drive the change based on data. In our session, we will provide you with some key lessons learned around how growing people and their engineering practices actually creates the differentiator for a business and not the technology or platforms that an organization purchases.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Rupesh Kumar is the principal DevOps working with Andrew Foster who is the director of DevOps Engineering at Humana. And we would like to share some insights which you can take it back to your organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Andrew Foster is the director of DevOps Engineering at Humana. His team is responsible for all of the DevOps platforms. For Humana, we care for the engineer experience as well as the engineers tooling. And I love it every day.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Humana is a Fortune 41 health and wellness company. Our primary business is serving our 5.1 million individual and group medicare advantage members. How does DevOps fit into that? Our mission is to give engineers the most compelling development experience possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Our DevOps journey started at Humana in 2018 with the leadership team wanting to drive change. Culture is what makes people understand each other better. Humana's strength is in developing a uniqueness and to always question the status quo. A happy employee makes the happy customer.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to make things happen incrementally and iteratively, it's very important for us to kind of like listen to the customers. Next thing is empower. The team is, I mean, it takes a village to drive a change. Andrew Rapesh will now talk about how we are scaling DevOps for a large organization like Humana.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are really three key steps and three key kind of methodologies that unlocked our ability to really scale DevOps. The first one is alignment and feedback. The second key was to focus on platforms and tools that are engineer focused. And then the final bit is smaller releases, right.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Greenlight API is our patented solution to incorporating Humana's SDLC into the DevOps pipelines. It gives the developers feedback as they go upon their software development journey. And it's one of the things that has really helped us unlock our DevOps journey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We consider open systems, which would be our traditional net, Java, Python, et cetera, programming languages. And then of course, mainframe has its own experience. We really are pushing towards a sense of ownership for development teams to build and own their pipelines.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Humana has over 1600 applications and components with over 300 teams. We have over 10 million lines of code with over 17,000 CI CD pipelines. Over 56% of automation releases over manual releases. 97% of our releases are eligible for releases in production.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Rapesh: As we all know, DevOps is certainly a journey and not a destination. Hopefully next year Andrew and I will come back again to share new challenges and opportunities. With that, I would say thank you for tuning in and joining our session.
