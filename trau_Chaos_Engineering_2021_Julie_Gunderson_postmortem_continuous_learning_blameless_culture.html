    <meta property="og:description" content="So you’ve had an incident. Restoring service is just the first step—your team should also be prepared to learn from incidents and outages. In this talk you will learn some best practices around postmortems/post incident reviews to help your team and organization see incidents as a learning opportunity and not just a disruption in service. In this workshop, attendees will:  * Get an overview of blameless postmortems * Learn techniques for effective information sharing * Learn how to run a postmortem meeting effectively * Understand the difference between “blame” and “accountability”"/>

<p>So you’ve had an incident. Restoring service is just the first step—your team should also be prepared to learn from incidents and outages. In this talk you will learn some best practices around postmortems/post incident reviews to help your team and organization see incidents as a learning opportunity and not just a disruption in service. In this workshop, attendees will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an overview of blameless postmortems</li>
<li>Learn techniques for effective information sharing</li>
<li>Learn how to run a postmortem meeting effectively</li>
<li>Understand the difference between “blame” and “accountability”</li>
</ul>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Julie Gunderson, DevOps advocate at Pagerduty, talks about postmortems, continuous learning and enabling a blameless culture. Postmortems provide a peacetime opportunity to reflect once an issue is no longer impacting users and organizations. Delaying the postmortem delays key learnings that will prevent the incident from reoccurring.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For the postmortem process to result in learning and system improvements, the new view of human error must be followed. The tendency to blame is hardwired through millions of years of evolutionary neurobiology. Another pervasive bias is the tendency to favor information that reinforces existing beliefs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Ask what and how questions rather than who or why. Asking what questions grounds the analysis in the big picture of the contributing factors to the incident. When in crying about human action, abstract it to an inspecific responder.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The inclination to blame individuals when faced with a surprising failure is ingrained deeply in all of us. Punishing individuals for causing incidents discourages people from speaking up when problems occur. Organizations can rapidly improve the resilience of their systems by eliminating the fear of blame. Culture change doesn't happen overnight.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For action items to get done, they have to have clear owners. Engineering leadership helps clarify what parts of the system each team owns. We've also seen improved accountability for completing action items by involving the leaders. The most important outcome of a post mortem meeting is to gain buy in for the action plan.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to document the facts of what happened during the incident. Avoid evaluating what should or should not have been done and coming to conclusions about what caused the incidents. The goal in analyzing the incidents is not to identify a root cause but to understand the multiple factors that created an environment where failure became possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The external postmortem is a summarized and sanitized version of the information used for the internal postmortem. After you've completed the written postmortem, follow up with a meeting to discuss the incident. The purpose of this meeting is to deepen the postmortem analysis through direct communication.
