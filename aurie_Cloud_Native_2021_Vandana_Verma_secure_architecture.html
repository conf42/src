    <meta property="og:description" content="Organisations are moving to cloud due to easy of use, scalability, computing services and many more things that cloud has to offer. Tough times have changed the paradigm to a new level where organisations which were only in the planning stage are now on the cloud. However, when cloud offers the benefits, there are certain Risks that also come with it. The stepping stone while taking the step forward towards cloud is Architecture Review or Secure Architecture Review.  We will be touching up various clouds.  This talk will cover the following aspects around Cloud Services. 1. Basics of Cloud Security Architecture and why to need an Architecture Review 2. Architecture Review Methodology 3. How is it useful? 5. What the developers or admins have to keep in mind "/>

<p>Organisations are moving to cloud due to easy of use, scalability, computing services and many more things that cloud has to offer. Tough times have changed the paradigm to a new level where organisations which were only in the planning stage are now on the cloud. However, when cloud offers the benefits, there are certain Risks that also come with it. The stepping stone while taking the step forward towards cloud is Architecture Review or Secure Architecture Review.  We will be touching up various clouds.</p>
<p>This talk will cover the following aspects around Cloud Services.
1. Basics of Cloud Security Architecture and why to need an Architecture Review
2. Architecture Review Methodology
3. How is it useful?

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to talk about building secure architecture in the cloud. Why do we need to have an architecture review for cloud when we are thinking about moving to cloud? What are the considerations that we should have? And then we will sum up all of that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                90% of the data and analytics would be there in public cloud by 2022. Over 98% people, 98% organizations which have moved to cloud. More than 1.3 trillion it spending will be affected by this shift.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Recent trends in cybersecurity statistics reveal a huge increase in the cybersecurity space. Most companies have unprotected data poor cybersecurity practices in place. There are teams working towards securing in organizations where there's so much data still lying out there.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another shift that I've heard that people are moving their legacy applications to containers or to cloud. But think about legacy applications already have an overhead. Another concern is the hybrid cloud kind of an environment or multicloud. How are we going to attain that?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Managing data on the cloud is a function, actually a task that is co owned and co managed by the cloud. Secure architecture review is to identify and highlight those cloud security weaknesses and strengths. If we don't do the right architecture design, we could be in trouble.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing that we have to understand is that our network is hostile, completely hostile, before even moving to the cloud. The most important thing is to have a proper plan to address the security components that are part of our architecture. It's important to understand the basics of public, private and hybrid cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Threat modeling is crucial, as it sounds, or it help teams to proactively understand and develop a strategy for identifying the potential threats early. When we are doing the threat modeling, we need to create data flow diagrams. If we don't have the right kind of training around these data Flow diagrams, it can lead us to the wrong way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In public cloud, there is a shared responsibility model wherein how cloud security provider and we are going to manage it and security for things like data classification, network controls, physical security and whatnot. Making cloud security more important than ever.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Casp is cloud access security broker which can be there at cloud edge. Another thing would be data user behavior and activity monitoring within and across the authorized and unauthorized SaaS cloud providers. Building a security in the cloud is not an easy task, but not a difficult task.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
