                Robert Ross is the CEO and co founder of Firehydrant, a reliability platform for teams of all sizes. He shares 42 pragmatic incident response lessons learned from failures. The habit of ignoring small issues is often really going to lead to bigger issues.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For huge incidents, let's talk small first. Run retros for tiny incidents. Don't go into a giant incident retrospective for the first time. Low stake incidents are the best place to get better at doing retros.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Check your MTTR. MTTR is a great statistic to measure and improve incident response on your team. Track your meantime to retro. Hold prompt and consistent retros on your incidents the easiest way.

              </li>

                The severity of your incidents is directly linked to customer pain. Alert on when a customer is feeling a problem, not when the computer is potentially just doing its job. Create service level objectives that are tied to a customer experience and alert on those.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Who do you notify about an incident? Can a small set of people tackle an incident without disrupting the rest of the company? When does customer success and support get involved? Too many cooks spoil the broth.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What teams own your services? You need to be considering your service ownership before you actually have an outage. Knowing which team to send to the fire is critical. Build a service catalog, assign clear ownership lines, and it will greatly help you in your incident response.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Declare and run retros for the small incidents. Action items are more actionable. Alert on pain felt by people, not computers. assign clear service owners. If you don't have a clear line of ownership, you're going to have longer incidents.
              </li>
