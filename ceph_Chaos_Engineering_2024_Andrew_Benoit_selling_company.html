                Andrew Benoit will discuss how to get the maximum value out of your sales rep. Turn him from a thorn in your side, potentially into an actual asset. He will also teach you how to avoid a lot of the mistakes that I've seen project leaders make. If you'd like to connect after the conversation, please add me on LinkedIn.

                There are a ton of misconceptions about how salespeople are trained and how we're incentivized. Ask them to take notes and summarize every meeting, including who attended from each team. Meet in person at the office whenever possible.

                Live zooms and calls are so much more convenient. High performing sales keeps know how to identify and engage with each of these seven personas. And that's really hard to do so on a Zoom call with cameras off, or heck, even on.

                 mobilizers are the personas that have the most influence in your company. They're proactive in identifying leading strategic initiatives and opportunities for improvement. The climber is less likely to take risks that would hurt their upward progress. And oftentimes they don't have nearly the internal influence that go getters have.

                While both blockers and skeptics may exhibit resistance to change, blockers tend to be more dogmatic. Whereas skeptics, they're a little bit more open minded. With blockers, it's important to approach with caution, depending on how much power they have.

                The last mobilizer Persona we want to address is the teacher. Teachers have a wealth of experience and expertise. Do not avoid the skeptic. Don't chase years, chase the confrontation. With empathy and logic and reasoning, overcome why they should be on your side.

                Your goal should not be to build a chaos engineering practice. Focus on measurable and achievable outcomes. Even Netflix doesn't use the term chaos engineering anymore for this reason. I'd really recommend viewing fault injection as a critical adjoining portion of other initiatives.

                The IDC estimates that orgs are going to spend over trillion dollars this year on cloud initiatives and support services. If things don't go well, your leadership team and your company's stock value not going to have a fun time. The earlier you find these issues, the easier and less expensive it'll be to fix them.

              <li>
                We weren't collecting nearly enough metrics to truly understand when things would go haywire. It's actually to be expected, especially when using brand new cloud and container services. Are you really getting the most out of your observability spend? Couldn't you just make a minor change and get a lot more value?

                Another use cases I've seen be really valuable to tie onto are making Dr. Not a disaster and education budgets. Using updated tooling and modern tooling can be a great way to make disaster recovery way less painful.

                This slide shows a fairly easy way to show value by quantifying how much adding another nine can have on your bottom line. The next thing I really want to emphasize is the importance of coming up with an implementation plan. Your leaders are going to want to seen that you've put serious thought in this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Remember your sales rep when used correctly. You'll likely find their help valuable when navigating through your company's internal politics. Most importantly, stick to business value and kill the chaos buzz.
