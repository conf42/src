              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Dan Davella is the lead maintainer of the Python code moderator framework. The idea is to help developers and security engineers to automate improvements and fixes to their code. This is an open source framework. We'll talk about the motivation for having a new code mod framework at all.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a lot of insecure code out there. And the even bigger problem is that this insecure code is not actually getting fixed. We're not fixing the security problems in our own code. One solution is to automatically merge fixes to outstanding security problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A code mod is code that is capable of changing or updating other code. codemodder is not the first code mod framework out there. Other prior art includes JS code shift and Libcst. Why did we need to design and develop a new codemod framework?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Codemodder takes the results of security tools and uses that to drive fixes for problems that are identified. Another big part of the code moderate philosophy is that we want our code mods to tell a story and to educate users. The fixes we provide should be comprehensible to developers and compelling.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Codemodder can replace unsafe Pyaml loader. The default loader in Pyaml is actually insecure. It potentially enables arbitrary code execution. Codemodder has a pretty large catalog of code mods that we currently support.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next one I'm going to show you is a personal favorite of mine. This is one that uses diffused XML for parsing XML. Because that has secured against many of these different types of XML attacks. In order for this to work properly, it actually needs to add the diffusing XML dependency to your project if it's not already present.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Here's another code mod that automates closing resources. In a similar vein, this is one that parameterizes SQL queries to make them safe against SQL injection. I think this is a very cool, very valuable code mod and a very impressive one too.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use generator expressions identifies places where list comprehensions have been used and rewrites them in terms of generator expressions where possible. This changes these data sets so that they're now lazily evaluated instead of having to load all of them in memory. In some cases this could lead to denial of service.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A code mod really consists of three different components. The detector is responsible for finding problems. The transformer is what's actually responsible for changing the code and making the fix. And then the metadata is the part of the code mod that actually tells a story.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 metadata consists of a name which is really a unique identifier for a code mod. The next part of code mod metadata is a summary which is a short human readable description of the change being made. In this case, we've decided to represent this as a separate markdown file.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sometimes a code mod needs to add a dependency. In the Python packaging ecosystem there's a bunch of different places where packages can be, where dependencies can be expressed. This is a tricky problem to solve. It's something that definitely differentiates ourselves from other code mod frameworks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code moderate framework supports a plugin infrastructure for loading custom code mods. If you write a custom code mod, our framework is capable of automatically loading it. Here's an example of a code mod called secure random. It replaces the standard import random module with a more secure and safer system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A code mod can be used to make your code more secure. It uses a Semgrep detector to find locations in the code that look insecure. The results of that are then fed to a transformer. The new call is going to look like secrets system random random.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pixie is an open source framework for code modders. Could we apply transformations to other kinds of code? Should we use large language models like llms? We'd love to hear your feedback from you.
              </li>
