    <meta property="og:description" content="As we took our SaaS platform from Alpha to Beta to GA, we accrued a rapidly expanding set of microservices. Engineers were unhappy with performance they were experiencing in local development, and tests on a single microservice became meaningless without the others.  This presentation walks through our experiences in building a scalable system that allowed our team to continue developing on their laptops as our platform grew. These include first implementing Docker Compose, then Kompose to move most of the workload to Kubernetes, and then Kotlin tooling to improve the flexibility of our local/Kubernetes hybrid development environment.  This talk will look at the tradeoffs of these different tools and the iterations that led us to where we are today. We will dive into how conference attendees can think about implementing these tools in their own environments to help engineers develop locally."/>

<p>As we took our SaaS platform from Alpha to Beta to GA, we accrued a rapidly expanding set of microservices. Engineers were unhappy with performance they were experiencing in local development, and tests on a single microservice became meaningless without the others.</p>
<p>This presentation walks through our experiences in building a scalable system that allowed our team to continue developing on their laptops as our platform grew. These include first implementing Docker Compose, then Kompose to move most of the workload to Kubernetes, and then Kotlin tooling to improve the flexibility of our local/Kubernetes hybrid development environment.</p>
<p>This talk will look at the tradeoffs of these different tools and the iterations that led us to where we are today. We will dive into how conference attendees can think about implementing these tools in their own environments to help engineers develop locally.</p>

                Conf 42 cloud native 2022 thank you for joining my presentation. My talk is entitled Local Microservice Development with remote kubernetes assist. At Stackhawk we build tools for test driven security. I should also mention that we are hiring.

              <li>
                When we started about three years ago, we wanted to build out a really state of the art platform. To help us in this build platform, we created a big bash script. All these stuff runs on AWS code. Build, just runs build steps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We like building and running and debugging things locally and using profilers locally. So what we did is we found something called compose with a k. It can reuse your existing docker compose files and it can generate Kubernetes manifests based on those. And then it would set up Kubernets port forwarding to reach those microservices locally.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                New Biodome command gives access to common build functions that we've abstracted out into libraries in ArI. It works directly against the Kubernetes and AWS APIs. It's opinionated, super simple to use for newcomers, and it's flexible and extensible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Were also thought about other functions that we can use to provision other kinds of resources for developers. We ended up building an IDP that really helps our developers get on board fast. I want to take a moment to thank all of the developers at Stackhawk. Everybody really took part in this project.
