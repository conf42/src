                Steve Kuchin is the senior developer advocate at Lumigo. He says he's been a developer advocate for many, many years now. He's also worked in digital agencies, which he says is "organized chaos" He says scaling applications is fundamental in the early stages of any application.

              <li>
                Python is great for game development, application development and heavy lifting. It can handle a whole bunch of tasks that you can throw at it, particularly in the API space. Shout out to all the folks that help maintain and contribute to those too. Please contribute back wherever you can to keep all our applications happy.

              <li>
                Application deployment doesn't stop beyond that initial deployment. Monitoring and sort of tracing and observing applications beyond deployment is equally as important. There's a number of ways to identify and spot issues inside code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Schrodinger's app simulates errors so we can see and understand as developers how you can identify and trace and monitor. Essentially, the app itself is built using Flask. Always looking for contributors too.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Tracing is important and monitoring, because you're able to identify this particular, this type of stock that should have thrown. And as a deployed application, this helps me understand how my application will handle these errors. We'll look at how that works on the cloud side of things in 1 minute.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Having that one error occur locally is completely different to having that happen on not only cloud infrastructure, but deployed cloud native application infrastructure. This is weve distributed tracing is able to help with this. It simplifies the mapping of your application and its footprint across that cloud native service.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open Telemetry has been around since 2019, and is part of the cloud Native Cloud foundation. It takes a vendor neutral approach to observability across application metrics, frameworks and that whole community industry standard approach. Lumigo is always looking for contributors to the project.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                These are really because of the industry standard approach to open telemetry. These are super easy to configure and install. You can use PIP with Python, you just use PiP to install the tracer library. Configure some environmental variables. How that can fit into tracing to give you a better view of what your application is doing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The Lumigo open telemetry tracer runs inside the ECS application. The library then adds additional trace information as part of the application running. And again, it appears to be working on the front end but not necessarily on the back end because of the distributed cloud.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Always be building for scale or aps as I like to think of it from the initial onset. Make sure you trace and monitor everything you possibly can to make sure everything's working as it potentially should. Always remember to use your tech superpowers for good and be excellent to each other.
