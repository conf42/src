                Ronnie Dover talks about open telemetry and coding with the insights on. Dover: I think it represents a very big change in how we write code. He hopes that by the end of this presentation, he will convince you that these things are really worth looking at.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developers used to take a feature, develop it all the way through, and then deploy it into production. But as teams become more cross functional, developers started taking on more responsibility. Here is a diagram showing the DevOps loop that by now is completely overused. But there is one segment that only has one tool associated with it, and that is continuous feedback.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry is a spec, it's a standard. And there are lots of implementations of that spec for different languages, platforms and so on. Many programming languages actually integrate with it in a very, very easy way. There is already automatic instrumentation available.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's already very useful information about the pieces of code that we're writing. 99% of the time, Bill would still not use that data. The more profound reason is that it's not continuous. We need to create a continuous feedback platform.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I think one of the more fundamental things that need to change is more around culture. If we don't use and harvest the observability data we already have, then why are we collecting it? Feedback is something that we need to implement in the process. We need to have at least a biweekly feedback meeting.
