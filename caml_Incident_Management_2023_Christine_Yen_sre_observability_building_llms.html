<!-- Text -->
<p>Building on LLMs is magicalâ€”but maintaining LLM-backed code is tricky: how do you ensure perf/correctness for something probabilistic?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like building on any black box (eg APIs/DBs). We&rsquo;ll cover instrumentation techniques, uses for observability best practices, and even using SLOs early in dev.</p>

                The techniques that I'll describe today should be transferable to your tool of about this will draw from our experience of building on llms, but should apply to whatever LLM and observability stack you're using today. There's suddenly a lot more demand for AI functionality than there are people who carry expertise for it.

                RaE Rag is a practice of pulling in additional context within your domain to help your llms return better results. Even product development or release practices are turned a little bit inside out. Observability is a way of comparing what you expect in your head versus the actual behavior, but in live data.

                Earlier this year we released our query assistant in May 2023. Took about six weeks of development super fast, and we spent another eight weeks iterating on it. Six months later, it's so much more common for us to meet someone playing around with llms than someone whose product has actual LLM functionality deployed in production.

                The concept most commonly associated with ensuring consistent performance of production systems service level objectives are slos. Often used as a way to set a baseline and measure degradation over time of a key product workflow. Being able to track historical compliance is what allows the team to iterate fast and confidently.
